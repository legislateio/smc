#### 14.04.090 - Charge—Time for filing.

In addition to any relief authorized by this chapter, liability may accrue and an aggrieved person may obtain relief as provided in this chapter, including recovery of back pay for up to two years preceding the filing of the charge, where the unlawful employment practices that have occurred during the charge filing period are similar or related to unlawful employment practices with regard to discrimination in compensation that occurred outside the time for filing a charge.

The charging party may also amend a charge to include allegations of additional unrelated discriminatory acts and/or retaliation which arose after filing of the original charge. The amendment must be filed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the occurrence of the additional discriminatory act and/or retaliation and prior to the Department's issuance of findings of fact and a determination with respect to the original charge. Such amendments may be made at any time during the investigation of the original charge so long as the Department will have adequate time to investigate such additional allegations and the parties will have adequate time to present the Department with evidence concerning such allegations before the issuance of findings of fact and a determination.


#### 14.04.110 - Charge—Notice and investigation.

1. The Director shall cause to be served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy of the charge on the respondent within twenty (20) days after the filing of the charge and shall promptly make an investigation thereof.

3. During the investigation the Director shall consider any statement of position or evidence with respect to the allegations of the charge which the charging party or the respondent wishes to submit. The Director shall have authority to sign and issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses, the production of evidence including but not limited to books, records, correspondence or documents in the possession or under the control of the person subpoenaed, and access to evidence for the purpose of examination and copying, and conduct discovery procedures which may include the taking of interrogatories and oral depositions.
4. The Director may require a fact finding conference or participation in another process with the respondent and any of respondent's agents and witnesses and charging party during the investigation in order to define the issues, determine which elements are undisputed, resolve those issues which can be resolved, and afford an opportunity to discuss or negotiate settlement. Parties may have their legal counsel present if desired.

#### 14.04.120 - Findings of fact and determination of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause.

1. The results of the investigation shall be reduced to written findings of fact and a determination shall be made by the Director that there is or is not reasonable cause for believing that an unfair practice has been or is being committed, which determination shall also be in writing and issued with the written findings of fact. Where a City department is a respondent the Director shall issue such findings and determination only after having submitted proposed findings and determinations to the respondent and charging party for review and comment. With respect to the findings and determination, "issued" shall be defined as signed and dated by the Director.
2. The findings of fact and determination shall be furnished promptly to the respondent and charging party.
3. Once issued to the parties, the Director's findings of fact, determination and order may not be amended or withdrawn except upon the agreement of the parties or in response to an order by the Human Rights Commission after an appeal taken pursuant to Section 14.04.130 or 14.04.160; provided, that the Director may correct clerical mistakes or errors arising from oversight or omission upon a motion from a party or upon the Director's own motion.

#### 14.04.130 - Determination of no reasonable cause—Appeal from and dismissal.

If a determination is made that there is no reasonable cause for believing an unfair employment practice under this chapter has been committed, the charging party shall have the right to appeal such determination to the Commission within 30 days of the date the determination is signed by the Director by filing a written statement of appeal with the Commission. The Commission shall promptly deliver a copy of the statement to the Department and respondent and shall promptly consider and act upon such appeal by either affirming the Director's determination or, if the Commission believes the Director should investigate further, remanding it to the Director with a request for specific further investigation. In the event no appeal is taken or such appeal results in affirmance or if the Commission has not decided the appeal within 90 days from the date the appeal statement is filed, the determination of the Director shall be final and the charge deemed dismissed and the same shall be entered on the records of the Department.


#### 14.04.140 - Determination of reasonable cause—Conciliation and settlement of cases involving all respondents except City departments.

1. In all cases except a case in which a City department is the respondent, if a determination is made that reasonable cause exists to believe that an unfair practice has occurred, the Director shall endeavor to eliminate the unfair practice by conference, conciliation and persuasion. Conditions of settlement may include (but are not limited to) the elimination of the unfair employment practice, hiring, reinstatement or upgrading with or without back pay, lost benefits, attorney's fees, admittance or restoration to membership in a labor organization, admittance to participation in a guidance, apprentice training or retraining program or such other action which will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including action which could be ordered by a court, except that damages for humiliation and mental suffering shall not exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00). Any settlement agreement shall be reduced to writing and signed by the Director and the respondent. An order shall then be entered by the Director setting forth the terms of the agreement. Copies of such order shall be delivered to all affected parties.
2. In case of failure to reach an agreement and of conciliation and upon a written finding to that effect furnished to the charging party and respondent, except a case in which a City department is a respondent, the Director shall promptly cause to be delivered the entire investigatory file, including the charge and any and all findings made, to the City Attorney for further proceedings and hearing under this chapter pursuant to Section 14.04.170.

#### 14.04.150 - Determinations of reasonable cause—Conciliation, settlement and conclusion of cases involving City departments as respondents.

In all cases in which a City department is a respondent:


1. A determination of reasonable cause by the Director shall be deemed a finding that an unfair employment practice has been committed by respondent and is dispositive of this issue for all future proceedings under this chapter, unless appealed, reversed and remanded as provided in this chapter.
2. Within sixty (60) days of a determination of reasonable cause, the Director shall confer with the parties and determine an appropriate remedy, which remedy may include (but is not limited to) hiring, reinstatement or upgrading with or without back pay, lost benefits, attorney's fees, admittance to participation in a guidance, apprentice training or retraining program, or such other action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including action which could be ordered by a court, except that damages for humiliation and mental suffering shall not exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00). Such remedy shall be reduced to writing in an order of the Director.
3. The charging party must sign a release in the form and manner requested by the Department, releasing the City from further liability for acts giving rise to the charge in order to obtain the benefits of the remedy provided under this section and before payment can be made. Without such release, the Director's order with respect to the charging party's individual relief shall have no force and effect. In such event the Director shall notify the parties involved in writing.
4. In all cases where the remedy determined by the Director before or after any appeal includes a monetary payment which exceeds the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), the charge or claim, the Director's determination, order, the charging party's signed release and such further documentation as may be required shall be presented to the City Council for passage by separate ordinance. If the City Council fails or refuses to appropriate the amount ordered by the Director within ninety (90) days, the Director shall certify the case to the Hearing Examiner for a hearing to determine the appropriate monetary relief in the case which determination shall be final and binding upon the City.
5. Where the Director's order includes a monetary payment of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) or less, such payment shall be made under the authority and in the form and manner otherwise provided for by law for payment of such claims.

#### 14.04.160 - Appeals to the Commission from determinations of reasonable cause and orders of excess involving City departments as respondents.

In all cases in which a City department is a respondent:


1. The charging party or respondent may appeal the Director's order and determination of reasonable cause to the Commission within thirty (30) days of the Director's order by filing a written statement of appeal with the Commission. Such statement shall state specifically the grounds on which it is based and the reasons the determination or order or both is in error.
2. The Commission shall promptly mail a copy of the statement to the Department and to the other party and shall promptly consider and act upon such appeal by either affirming the Director's determination or order or remanding it to the Director with appropriate instructions.
3. The filing of an appeal shall stay the enforcement of any remedy provided for in the Director's determination or order during the pendency of the appeal.
4. In such appeal, the Commission shall consider only the record submitted to it by the Department and written statements of positions by the parties involved and, in its discretion, oral presentation. The Commission shall reverse the Director's determination or order only upon a finding that it is clearly erroneous.

5. After the filing of a complaint with the Hearing Examiner, it may be amended only with the permission of the Hearing Examiner, which permission shall be granted when justice will be served thereby and all parties are allowed time to prepare their case with respect to additional or expanded charges which they did not and could not have reasonably foreseen would be in issue at the hearing.
6. The hearing shall be conducted by a Hearing Examiner from the Office of Hearing Examiner, or a hearing examiner pro tempore appointed by the Hearing Examiner from a list approved by the Commission, sitting alone or with representatives of the Commission if any are designated. Such hearings shall be conducted in accordance with written rules and procedures consistent with this ordinance and the Administrative Code of the City (Ordinance 102228).
7. The Commission, within thirty (30) days after notice of the date of hearing from the Hearing Examiner, at its discretion, may appoint two (2) of its members who have not otherwise been involved in the charge, investigation, fact finding, or other resolution and proceeding on the merits of the case, who have not formed an opinion on the merits of the case, and who otherwise have no pecuniary, private or personal interest or bias in the matter, to hear the case with the Hearing Examiner. If the Commission has designated representatives they shall each have an equal vote with the Hearing Examiner, except the Hearing Examiner shall be the chairperson of the panel and make all evidentiary rulings. Should a question arise as to previous involvement, interest or bias of an appointed Commissioner, the Hearing Examiner shall resolve the issue in conformance with the law on the subject.

#### 14.04.180 - Decision and order

1. Within 30 days after conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Examiner (or the Examiner and Commissioners as the case may be) shall prepare a written decision and order, file it as a public record with the City Clerk, and provide a copy to each party of record and to the Department.

#### 14.04.185 - Enforcement by private persons.

1. Any person who claims to have been injured by an unfair employment practice may commence a civil action in Superior Court or any other court of competent jurisdiction, not later than three (3) years after the occurrence of the alleged unfair employment practice or ninety (90) days after a determination of reasonable cause by the Director, whichever occurs last, to obtain appropriate relief with respect to such unfair employment practice. In an action brought under this section, the court having jurisdiction may, upon written findings by the judge that the action was frivolous and advanced without reasonable cause, require the nonprevailing party to pay the prevailing party the reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred in opposing such action pursuant to RCW 4.84.185.
2. A complaint may be filed under this section whether or not an administrative charge has been filed under SMC Section 14.04.090, and without regard to the status of such charge, but if the Department has obtained a pre-finding or post-finding settlement or conciliation agreement with the consent of the charging party, no action may be filed under this section with respect to the alleged unfair employment practice which forms the basis for such complaint except for the purpose of enforcing the terms of the agreement. To preclude such filing, the charging party must be provided with written notice that consent to a pre-finding or post-finding settlement or conciliation agreement will terminate the charging party's right to file a civil action under this section.
3. Subject to the provisions of subsection C2, upon the filing of a civil action involving the same claim or arising from the same facts and circumstances, whether under this subchapter or similar law, a complaint of an unfair employment practice may be administratively closed by the Director.

    1. In the event that a court dismisses a private cause of action on grounds that would not preclude pursuit of a charge under this subchapter, the charging party may request, within ninety (90) days of the entry of the Court's order of dismissal, that the Department reopen a previously filed charged. Upon such request, the Director may reopen a case that was administratively closed upon the filing of a civil action. If the Department closes a case based on a "no reasonable cause" finding, the case shall not be reopened except as provided through appeal pursuant to SMC Section 14.04.030.
    2. No complainant or aggrieved person may secure relief from more than one (1) governmental agency, instrumentality or tribunal for the same harm or injury.
    3. Where the complainant or aggrieved person elects to pursue simultaneous claims in more than one (1) forum, the factual and legal determinations issued by the first tribunal to rule on the claims may, under the doctrines of "res judicata" or "collateral estoppel," be binding on all or portions of the claims pending before other tribunals.
    4. No civil action may be commenced under this section with respect to an alleged unfair employment practice which forms the basis of a complaint if a hearing on the record has been commenced by The City of Seattle Office of the Hearing Examiner. To preclude such filing, a charging party must be provided with written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of a hearing before The City of Seattle Office of the Hearing Examiner that the commencement of such a hearing will terminate the charging party's right to file a civil action.
4. In a civil action under this section, if the court, or jury, finds that an unfair employment practice has occurred, the court may grant such relief as may be awarded by the hearing examiner under this chapter or is authorized by the Washington Law Against Discrimination, Chapter 49.60 RCW, as amended. Damages awarded under this section for humiliation and mental suffering are not subject to the limitation of SMC Section 14.04.140 A or SMC Section 14.04.150 B.
5. Upon time application, the City Attorney may intervene in such civil action, if the City Attorney certifies that the case is of general public importance, and may obtain such relief as would be available in an action brought under SMC Sections 14.04.140 and 14.04.180. Such intervention shall not be permitted in an action in which the City is a defendant.
6. It is the intent of The City of Seattle, in enacting this section, to provide private judicial remedies for violations of this chapter that are as expansive as possible consistent with the powers granted by the Constitution and Laws of The State of Washington. In the event that any provision or aspect of this section is adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions shall be unaffected.

#### 14.04.190 - Construction with other laws.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to invalidate or restrict or deny any right or remedy any person may have under state or federal law or preclude any cause of action in court otherwise provided for the violation of any person's civil rights; nor shall this chapter be construed to preclude any person aggrieved from seeking judicial review of any final administrative decision or order made under this chapter affecting such person.


#### 14.04.200 - Cooperative agreements.

Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prevent the receiving, referring, or other processing of complaints, in accordance with a cooperative agreement with the Washington State Human Rights Commission, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or with other agencies concerned with the enforcement of laws against discrimination.


#### 14.04.210 - Violation—Penalty.

It is unlawful for any person to wilfully engage in an unfair practice under this chapter or wilfully resist, prevent, impede or interfere with the Director or Hearing Examiner in the performance of their duties under this chapter, or to fail, refuse, or neglect to comply with any lawful order of the Director or Hearing Examiner. Conduct made unlawful by this section constitutes a violation subject to the provisions of Chapter 12A.01 and Chapter 12A.02 of the Seattle Criminal Code (Ordinance 102843, as amended), and any person convicted thereof may be punished by a civil fine or forfeiture not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500).


#### 14.04.220 - Application to pending charges and complaints.

The procedures for administration and enforcement under this chapter shall apply to charges pending which have not had a date certain set for hearing as of the effective date of this ordinance. However, this section shall not be construed to invalidate any administrative action taken or determinations and orders made on pending charges because of the procedures provided by this chapter.

The City Attorney's office shall provide written notice to the charging party at least 30 days prior to the commencement of a hearing before the Hearing Examiner that the commencement of such a hearing will terminate the charging party's right to file a civil action.
4. Any person who claims to have been injured by, or believes that he or she will be injured by an unfair practice which is the subject matter of the civil action filed under this section may intervene as of right in the civil action.
5. Subject to the provisions of subsection E(2), upon the filing of a civil action involving the same claim or arising from the same facts and circumstances, whether under this chapter or similar law, a charge of an unfair practice may be administratively closed by the Director. Upon request by a charging party, the Director may keep a charge of unfair practice open pending commencement of a trial in a civil action.

    1. In the event that a court dismisses a private cause of action on grounds that would not preclude pursuit of a charge under this subchapter, the charging party may request, within 90 days of the entry of the court's order of dismissal, that the Department reopen a previously filed charge. Upon such request, the Director may reopen a charge that was administratively closed upon the filing of a civil action.
    2. No charging party or aggrieved person may secure relief from more than one governmental agency, instrumentality or tribunal for the same harm or injury.
6. In a civil action under this section, if the court finds that an unfair practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, including an order enjoining the defendant from engaging in such practice or ordering such affirmative action as may be appropriate. The court may also award actual damages, including damages for humiliation and mental suffering, damages for the loss of the right to be free from discrimination in real estate transactions, and any other appropriate remedy set forth in the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.). The court may also allow reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the prevailing party.
7. Relief granted under this section shall not affect any contract, sale, encumbrance, or lease consummated before the granting of such relief and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant, without actual notice of the filing of a charge or civil action under this chapter.
8. Upon timely application, the City Attorney may intervene in such civil action, if the City Attorney certifies that the case is of general public importance, and may obtain such relief as would be available in an action brought under SMC 14.08.165 and damages and penalties as contemplated by SMC 14.08.180 and 14.08.185.

Conditions of settlement may include (but are not limited to) the elimination of the unfair contracting practice, hiring, reinstatement, lost profits, attorney's fees, admittance or restoration to membership in a trade association, admittance to participation in a training, or such other action which will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including action which could be ordered by a court, except that damages for humiliation and mental suffering shall not exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000). Any settlement agreement shall be reduced to writing and signed by the Director and the respondent. An order shall then be entered by the Director setting forth the terms of the agreement. Copies of such order shall be delivered to all affected parties.
2.

In such event the Director shall notify the parties involved in writing.
4. In all cases where the remedy determined by the Director includes a monetary payment which exceeds the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000), the charge or claim, the Director's determination, order, the charging party's signed release and such further documentation as may be required shall be presented to the City Council for passage by separate ordinance. If the City Council fails or refuses to appropriate the amount ordered by the Director within ninety (90) days, the Director shall certify the case to the Hearing Examiner for a hearing to determine the appropriate monetary relief in the case which determination shall be final and binding upon the City.

5. After the filing of a complaint with the Hearing Examiner, it may be amended only with the permission of the Hearing Examiner, which permission shall be granted when justice will be served thereby and all parties are allowed time to prepare their case with respect to additional or expanded charges which they did not and could not have reasonably foreseen would be in issue at the hearing.

1. Any person who claims to have been injured by an unfair contracting practice may commence a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction, not later than three years after the occurrence of the alleged unfair contracting practice or ninety (90) days after a determination of reasonable cause by the Director, whichever occurs last, to obtain appropriate relief with respect to such unfair contracting practice.
2. A civil action may be filed under this section whether or not an administrative charge has been filed under Section 14.10.060, and without regard to the status of such charge, but if the Department has obtained a pre-finding or post-finding settlement or conciliation agreement with the consent of the charging party, no civil action may be filed under this section with respect to the alleged unfair contracting practice which forms the basis for such complaint except for the purpose of enforcing the terms of the agreement. To preclude such filing, the charging party must be provided with written notice that consent to a pre-finding or post-finding settlement or conciliation agreement will terminate the charging party's right to file a civil action under this section.

    1. In the event that a court dismisses a private cause of action on grounds that would not preclude pursuit of a charge under this chapter, the charging party may request, within ninety (90) days of the entry of the Court's order of dismissal, that the Department reopen a previously filed charge. Upon such request, the Director may reopen a case that was administratively closed upon the filing of a civil action. If the Department closes a case based on a "no reasonable cause" finding, the case shall not be reopened.

    4. No civil action may be commenced under this section with respect to an alleged unfair contracting practice which forms the basis of a complaint if a hearing on the record has been commenced by The City of Seattle Office of the Hearing Examiner. To preclude such filing, a charging party must be provided with written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of a hearing before The City of Seattle Office of the Hearing Examiner that the commencement of such a hearing will terminate the charging party's right to file a civil action.
4. In a civil action under this section, if the court, or jury, finds that an unfair contracting practice has occurred, the court may grant such relief as may be awarded by the Hearing Examiner under this chapter or is authorized by the Washington Law Against Discrimination, Chapter 49.60 RCW, as amended. Damages awarded under this section for humiliation and mental suffering are not subject to the limitation of Section 14.10.140.
5. Upon timely application, the City Attorney may intervene in such civil action, if the City Attorney certifies that the case is of general public importance, and may obtain such relief as would be available in an action brought under Section 14.10.130.

When an employee is separated from employment and rehired within seven months of separation by the same employer, the previous period of employment shall be counted for purposes of determining the employee's eligibility to use accrued sick time or safe time under this subsection, provided that if separation does occur, the total time of employment used to determine eligibility must occur within three calendar years.

11. When an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity, or location within the geographic limits of the City, or transferred out of the geographic limits of the City and then transferred back to a division, entity, or location within the geographic limits of the City, but remains employed by the same employer, the employee is entitled to all paid sick and paid safe time accrued at the prior division, entity, or location and is entitled to use all paid sick and paid safe time as provided in this Chapter 14.16.

Further, the employee shall be entitled to use accrued paid sick and paid safe time and accrue additional sick and safe time immediately upon the re-commencement of employment, provided that the employee had previously been eligible to use paid sick and paid safe time.

### 14.16.030 - Use of paid sick time and paid safe time

1. Paid sick time shall be provided to an employee by an employer for the following reasons:

    1. An absence resulting from an employee's mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; to accommodate the employee's need for medical diagnosis care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or an employee's need for preventive medical care; or
    2. To allow the employee to provide care of a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; care of a family member who needs medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or care of a family member who needs preventive medical care.
    3. Paid safe time shall be provided to an employee by an employer for the following reasons:

        1. When the employee's place of business has been closed by order of a public official to limit exposure to an infectious agent, biological toxin or hazardous material;
        2. To accommodate the employee's need to care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official for such a reason; or
        3. For any of the following reasons related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as set out in RCW 49.76.030:

            1. To enable the employee to seek legal or law enforcement assistance or remedies to ensure the health and safety of the employee or the employee's family members including, but not limited to, preparing for, or participating in, any civil or criminal legal proceeding related to or derived from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking;
            2. To enable the employee to seek treatment by a health care provider for physical or mental injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or to attend to health care treatment for a victim who is the employee's family member;
            3. To enable the employee to obtain, or assist a family member in obtaining, services from a domestic violence shelter, rape crisis center, or other social services program for relief from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking;
            4. To enable the employee to obtain, or assist a family member in obtaining, mental health counseling related to an incident of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, in which the employee or the employee's family member was a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or
            5. To enable the employee to participate in safety planning, temporarily or permanently relocate, or take other actions to increase the safety of the employee or employee's family members from future domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
2. Paid sick time and paid safe time shall be provided upon the request of an employee. When possible, the request shall include the expected duration of the absence. An employer may require an employee to comply with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for absences and/or requesting leave, provided that such requirements do not interfere with the purposes for which the leave is needed.

    1. If the paid leave is foreseeable, a written request shall be provided at least ten days, or as early as possible, in advance of the paid leave, unless the employer's normal notice policy requires less advance notice;
    2. If the paid leave is unforeseeable, the employee must provide notice as soon as is practicable and must generally comply with an employer's reasonable normal notification policies and/or call-in procedures, provided that such requirements do not interfere with the purposes for which the leave is needed.
3. For employees covered by the overtime requirements of state and federal laws, accrued paid sick time and paid safe time shall be used in the smaller of hourly increments or, if feasible by the employer's payroll system, increments that round to the nearest quarter of an hour. When using quarter-hour increments, employers shall use an employee's available paid sick and paid safe time to round up or down to the nearest quarter hour if necessary to prevent an employer's absence control policy from counting paid sick or paid safe time covered under this Chapter 14.16 as an absence that may lead to or result in any adverse action taken against the employee. For overtime exempt employees, an employer may make deductions of paid sick time and paid safe time in accordance with state and federal laws. For overtime exempt public employees, paid sick time and paid safe time must be used in accordance with a pay system established by statute, ordinance or regulation or by a policy or practice established pursuant to the principles of public accountability.
4. When the use of accrued time is foreseeable, the employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick or safe time in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.
5. For use of paid sick time of more than three consecutive days for a reason set out in subsection 14.16.030.A.1, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the sick time is covered by subsection 14.16.030.A.1. Documentation signed by a health care provider indicating that sick time is necessary shall be considered reasonable documentation. An employer may not require that the documentation explain the nature of the illness. For any employee who is not offered health insurance by the employer, the employer and the employee shall each pay half the cost of any out-of-pocket expense incurred by the employee in obtaining the employer-requested documentation. These expenses are limited to the cost of services provided by health care professionals, the services of health care facilities, testing prescribed by health care professionals and transportation to the location where such services are provided. An employee who has declined to participate in the health insurance program offered by the employer shall not be entitled to reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses.
6. For use of "paid safe time" of more than three consecutive days for a reason set out in subsection 14.16.030.A.2,

    1. an employer may require that requests under subsections 14.16.030.A.2.a and 14.16.030.A.2.b be supported by verification of a closure order by a public official of the employee's child's school or childcare establishment, and the employee may satisfy this verification request by providing notice of the closure order in whatever format the employee received the notice;
    2. an employer may require that requests under subsection 14.16.030.A.2.c be supported by verification that the employee or employee's family member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and that the leave taken was for one of the purposes covered by subsection 14.16.030.A.2.c. As set out in RCW 49.76.040(4), an employee may satisfy this verification requirement by one or more of the following methods:

        1. a police report indicating that the employee or employee's family member was a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking;
        2. a court order protecting or separating the employee or employee's family member from the perpetrator of the act of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or other evidence from the court or the prosecuting attorney that the employee or employee's family member appeared, or is scheduled to appear, in court in connection with an incident of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or
        3. documentation that the employee or the employee's family member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, from any of the following persons from whom the employee or employee's family member sought assistance in addressing the domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking: an advocate for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; an attorney; a member of the clergy; or a medical or other professional. The provision of documentation under this Section 14.16.030 does not waive or diminish the confidential or privileged nature of communications between a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking with one or more of the individuals named in this subsection 14.16.030.F.2.c; or
        4. an employee's written statement that the employee or the employee's family member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking and that the leave taken was for one of the purposes of subsection 14.16.030.A.2.c.
7. Upon mutual consent by the employee and the employer, an employee may work additional hours or shifts during the same or next pay period without using available paid sick or paid safe time for the original missed hours or shifts. However, the employer may not require the employee to work such additional hours or shifts. Should the employee work additional shifts, the employer shall comply with any applicable federal, state, or local laws concerning overtime pay.
8. Nothing in this Chapter 14.16 shall be construed to prohibit an employer from establishing a policy whereby employees may voluntarily exchange assigned hours or "trade shifts."
9. When paid sick or paid safe time is requested by an employee who works in an eating and/or drinking establishment, the employer may offer the employee substitute hours or shifts. If the employee accepts the offer and works these substitute hours or shifts, the amount of time worked during the substitute period or the amount of time requested for sick and safe time, whichever is smaller, may be deducted from the employee's accrued sick and safe time. Should the employee work the substitute hours or shifts, the employer shall comply with any applicable federal, state or local laws concerning overtime pay. However, no employer is required to offer such substitute hours or shifts, and no employee is required to accept such hours or shifts if they are offered.
10. Nothing in this Chapter 14.16 shall be construed to prohibit an employer from establishing a policy whereby employees may donate unused accrued paid sick leave to another employee.
11. Each time wages are paid, employers shall provide, in writing, information stating an updated amount of paid time available to each employee for use as either sick time or safe time. Employers may choose a reasonable system for providing this notification, including, but not limited to, listing remaining available paid time on each pay stub or developing an online system where employees can access their own paid leave information.

### 14.16.035 - Confidentiality and nondisclosure

1. Except as provided in subsection 14.16.035.B, an employer shall maintain the confidentiality of information provided by the employee or others in support of an employee's request for sick or safe days under this Section 14.16.035, including health information and the fact that the employee or employee's family member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, that the employee has requested or obtained leave under this Chapter 14.16, and any written or oral statement, documentation, record, or corroborating evidence provided by the employee.
2. Information given by an employee may be disclosed by an employer only if it is:

    1. Requested or consented to by the employee;
    2. Ordered by a court or administrative agency; or
    3. Otherwise required by applicable federal or state law.

### 14.16.040 - New employers

The provisions of this Chapter 14.16 shall not apply to Tier 1 and Tier 2 employers until 24 months after the hire date of their first employee. For purposes of this Section 14.16.040, employer tier shall be calculated based upon the average number of full-time equivalents who worked for compensation per calendar week during the first 90 calendar days following the hire date of their first employee.


### 14.16.045 - Notice and posting

1. The Agency shall create and distribute a poster giving notice of the rights afforded by this Chapter 14.16. The Agency shall create and distribute the poster in English, Spanish, and any other languages that are necessary for employers to comply with subsection 14.16.045.B. The poster shall give notice of:

    1. The right to paid sick and paid safe time guaranteed by this Chapter 14.16;
    2. The amount of paid sick and paid safe time and the terms of its use guaranteed under this Chapter 14.16;
    3. The right to be protected from retaliation for exercising in good faith the rights protected by this Chapter 14.16; and
    4. The right to file a complaint with the Agency or bring a civil action for violation of the requirements of this Chapter 14.16, including an employer's denial of paid sick time and paid safe time as required by this Chapter 14.16, and an employer or other person's retaliation against an employee or other person for requesting or taking paid sick and paid safe time or otherwise engaging in an activity protected by this Chapter 14.16.
2. Employers shall display the poster in a conspicuous and accessible location where any of their employees work. Employers shall display the poster in English and in the primary language(s) of the employee(s) at the particular workplace. If display of the poster is not feasible, including situations when the employee works remotely or does not have a regular workplace, employers may provide the poster on an individual basis in an employee's primary language in physical or electronic format that is reasonably conspicuous and accessible.
3. Effective April 1, 2016, employers shall give employees written notice of the employer's policy and procedure for meeting the requirements of this Chapter 14.16, including but not limited to the employer's choice of benefit year; tier size; rate of accrual, use and carry-over of paid sick and paid safe time hours; manner of providing employees with an updated amount of available paid sick and safe time hours each time wages are paid; and notification requirements for absences and requesting leave. The Agency shall create and distribute a model policy that employers may use for complying with this subsection 14.16.045.C.

### 14.16.050 - Employer records

1. Each employer shall retain records documenting hours worked by employees and paid sick and paid safe time used by covered employees. Such records shall be retained for a period of three years from the date such hours were worked or such paid sick and paid safe time was used. Employers shall not be required to modify their recordkeeping policies to comply with this Section 14.16.050, as long as records reasonably indicate employee hours worked in Seattle, accrued paid sick and paid safe time, and used paid sick and paid safe time.
2. If an employer fails to retain adequate records required under subsection 14.16.050.A, there shall be a presumption, rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer violated this Chapter 14.16 for the periods and for each employee for whom records were not retained.
3. Respondents in any case closed by the Agency shall allow the Office of City Auditor access to such records to permit the Office of City Auditor to evaluate the Agency's enforcement efforts. Before requesting records from such a respondent, the Office of City Auditor shall first consult the Agency's respondent records on file and determine if additional records are necessary. The City Auditor may apply by affidavit or declaration in the form allowed under RCW 9A.72.085 to the Hearing Examiner for the issuance of subpoenas under this subsection 14.16.050.C. The Hearing Examiner shall issue such subpoenas upon a showing that the records are required to fulfill the purpose of this subsection 14.16.050.C.
4. Records and documents relating to medical certifications, re-certifications, or medical histories of employees or employees' family members, created for purposes of this Chapter 14.16, are required to be maintained as confidential medical records in separate files/records from the employer's usual personnel files. If the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) applies, then these records must comply with such confidentiality requirements.

### 14.16.055 - Retaliation prohibited

1. No employer or any other person shall interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of, or the attempt to exercise, any right protected under this Chapter 14.16.
2. No employer or any other person shall take any adverse action against any person because the person has exercised in good faith the rights protected under this Chapter 14.16. Such rights include but are not limited to the right to use paid sick time and/or paid safe time pursuant to this Chapter 14.16; the right to make inquiries about the rights protected under this Chapter 14.16; the right to inform others about their rights under this Chapter 14.16; the right to inform the person's employer, union, or similar organization, and/or the person's legal counsel or any other person about an alleged violation of this Chapter 14.16; the right to file an oral or written complaint with the Agency or bring a civil action for an alleged violation of this Chapter 14.16; the right to cooperate with the Agency in its investigations of this Chapter 14.16; the right to testify in a proceeding under or related to this Chapter 14.16; the right to refuse to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of city, state or federal law; and the right to oppose any policy, practice, or act that is unlawful under this Chapter 14.16.
3. No employer or any other person shall communicate to a person exercising rights protected in this Section 14.16.055, directly or indirectly, the willingness to inform a government employee that the person is not lawfully in the United States, or to report, or to make an implied or express assertion of a willingness to report, suspected citizenship or immigration status of an employee or family member of the employee to a federal, state, or local agency because the employee has exercised a right under this Chapter 14.16.
4. It shall be a rebuttable presumption of retaliation if an employer or any other person takes an adverse action against a person within 90 days of the person's exercise of rights protected in this Section 14.16.055. However, in the case of seasonal work that ended before the close of the 90 day period, the presumption also applies if the employer fails to rehire a former employee at the next opportunity for work in the same position. The employer may rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the adverse action was taken for a permissible purpose.
5. Standard of proof. Proof of retaliation under this Section 14.16.055 shall be sufficient upon a showing that an employer or any other person has taken an adverse action against a person and the person's exercise of rights protected in this Section 14.16.055 was a motivating factor in the adverse action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such protected activity.
6. The protections afforded under this Section 14.16.055 shall apply to any person who mistakenly but in good faith alleges violations of this Chapter 14.16.
7. A complaint or other communication by any person triggers the protections of this Section 14.16.055 regardless of whether the complaint or communication is in writing or makes explicit reference to this Chapter 14.16.

### 14.16.060 - Enforcement power and duties

1. The Agency shall have the power to investigate violations of this Chapter 14.16, as defined herein, and shall have such powers and duties in the performance of these functions as are defined in this Chapter 14.16 and otherwise necessary and proper in the performance of the same and provided for by law.
2. The Agency shall be authorized to coordinate implementation and enforcement of this Chapter 14.16 and shall promulgate appropriate guidelines or rules for such purposes.
3. The Director of the Agency is authorized and directed to promulgate rules consistent with this Chapter 14.16 and the Administrative Code. Any guidelines or rules promulgated by the Director shall have the force and effect of law and may be relied on by employers, employees, and other parties to determine their rights and responsibilities under this Chapter 14.16.

### 14.16.065 - Violation

The failure of any respondent to comply with any requirement imposed on the respondent under this Chapter 14.16 is a violation.


### 14.16.070 - Investigation

1. The Agency shall have the power to investigate any violations of this Chapter 14.16 by any respondent. The Agency may initiate an investigation pursuant to rules issued by the Director including, but not limited to, situations when the Director has reason to believe that a violation has occurred or will occur, or when circumstances show that violations are likely to occur within a class of businesses because the workforce contains significant numbers of workers who are vulnerable to violations of this Chapter 14.16 or the workforce is unlikely to volunteer information regarding such violations. An investigation may also be initiated through the receipt by the Agency of a report or complaint filed by an employee or other person.
2. An employee or other person may report to the Agency any suspected violation of this Chapter 14.16. The Agency shall encourage reporting pursuant to this Section 14.16.070 by taking the following measures:

    1. The Agency shall keep confidential, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, the name and other identifying information of the employee or person reporting the violation. However, with the authorization of such person, the Agency may disclose the employee's or person's name and identifying information as necessary to enforce this Chapter 14.16 or for other appropriate purposes.
    2. An employer must post or otherwise notify its employees that the Agency is conducting an investigation, using a form provided by the Agency and displaying it on-site, in a conspicuous and accessible location, and in English and the primary language of the employee(s) at the particular workplace. If display of the form is not feasible, including situations when the employee works remotely or does not have a regular workplace, employers may provide the form on an individual basis in the employee's primary language in physical or electronic format that is reasonably conspicuous and accessible.
    3. The Agency may certify the eligibility of eligible persons for "U" Visas under the provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1184.p and 8 U.S.C. § 1101.a.15.U. This certification is subject to applicable federal law and regulations, and rules issued by the Director.
3. The Agency's investigation must commence within three years of the alleged violation. To the extent permitted by law, the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions is tolled during any investigation under this Chapter 14.16 and any administrative enforcement proceeding under this Chapter 14.16 based upon the same facts. For purposes of this Chapter 14.16:

    1. The Agency's investigation begins on the earlier date of when the Agency receives a complaint from a person under this Chapter 14.16, or the Agency opens an investigation under this Chapter 14.16.
    2. The Agency's investigation ends when the Agency issues a final order concluding the matter and any appeals have been exhausted; the time to file any appeal has expired; or the Agency notifies the respondent in writing that the investigation has been otherwise resolved.
4. The Agency's investigation shall be conducted in an objective and impartial manner.
5. The Director may apply by affidavit or declaration in the form allowed under RCW 9A.72.085 to the Hearing Examiner for the issuance of subpoenas requiring an employer to produce the records identified in subsection 14.16.050.A, or for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or for the production of documents required to be retained under subsection 14.16.050.A, or any other document relevant to the issue of whether any employee or group of employees has been or is afforded proper amounts of paid sick and paid safe time under this Chapter 14.16 and/or to whether an employer has violated any provision of this Chapter 14.16. The Hearing Examiner shall conduct the review without hearing as soon as practicable and shall issue subpoenas upon a showing that there is reason to believe that a violation has occurred if a complaint has been filed with the Agency, or that circumstances show that violations are likely to occur within a class of businesses because the workforce contains significant numbers of workers who are vulnerable to violations of this Chapter 14.16 or the workforce is unlikely to volunteer information regarding such violations.
6. An employer that fails to comply with the terms of any subpoena issued under subsection 14.16.070. E. in an investigation by the Agency under this Chapter 14.16 prior to the issuance of a Director's Order issued pursuant to subsection 14.16.075.C may not use such records in any appeal to challenge the correctness of any determination by the Agency of damages owed or penalties assessed.
7. In addition to other remedies, the Director may refer any subpoena issued under subsection 14.16.070.E to the City Attorney to seek a court order to enforce any subpoena.
8. Where the Director has reason to believe that a violation has occurred, the Director may order any appropriate temporary or interim relief to mitigate the violation or maintain the status quo pending completion of a full investigation or hearing, including but not limited to a deposit of funds or bond sufficient to satisfy a good-faith estimate of wages, interest, damages, and penalties due. A respondent may appeal any such order in accordance with Section 14.16.085.

### 14.16.075 - Findings of fact and determination

1. Except when there is an agreed upon settlement, the Director shall issue a written determination with findings of fact resulting from the investigation and statement of whether a violation of this Chapter 14.16 has or has not occurred based on a preponderance of the evidence before the Director.
2. If the Director determines that there is no violation of this Chapter 14.16, the Director shall issue a "Determination of No Violation" with notice of an employee or other person's right to appeal the decision, subject to the rules of the Director.
3. If the Director determines that a violation of this Chapter 14.16 has occurred, the Director shall issue a "Director's Order" that shall include a notice of violation identifying the violation or violations. The Director's Order shall state with specificity the amounts due under this Chapter 14.16 for each violation, including payment of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, fines, and interest pursuant to Section 14.16.080. The Director's Order may specify that civil penalties and fines due to the Agency can be mitigated for respondent's timely payment of remedy due to an aggrieved party under subsection 14.16.080.A.2. The Director's Order may direct the respondent to take such corrective action as is necessary to comply with the requirements of this Chapter 14.16, including, but not limited to, monitored compliance for a reasonable time period. The Director's Order shall include notice of the respondent's right to appeal the decision pursuant to Section 14.16.085.

### 14.16.080 - Remedies

The fine amounts shall be increased cumulatively by 50 percent of the fine for each preceding violation for each subsequent violation of the same provision by the same respondent within a ten-year period. The maximum amount that may be imposed in fines in any one year period for each type of violation listed above is $5,000 unless a fine for retaliation is issued, in which case the maximum amount is $20,000.


1. The payment of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, fines, and interest provided under this Chapter 14.16 are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of any other available remedies, penalties, fines, and procedures.

    1. Effective January 1, 2017, the amounts of all civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, and fines contained in this Section 14.16.080 shall be increased annually to reflect the rate of inflation and calculated to the nearest cent on January 1 of each year thereafter. The Agency shall determine the amounts and file a schedule of such amounts with the City Clerk.
    2. If there is a remedy due to an aggrieved party, the Director may waive the total amount of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency if the Director determines that the respondent paid the full remedy due to the aggrieved party within ten days of service of the Director's Order. The Director may waive half the amount of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency if the Director determines that the respondent paid the full remedy due to the aggrieved party within 15 days of service of the Director's Order. The Director shall not waive any amount of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency if the Director determines that the respondent has not paid the full remedy due to the aggrieved party after 15 days of service of the Director's Order.
    3. When determining the amount of liquidated damages, civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, and fines due under this Section 14.16.080 for a Settlement Agreement or Director's Order, including but not limited to the mitigation of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency for timely payment of remedy due to an aggrieved party under subsection 14.16.080.A.2, the Director shall consider the total amount of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, penalties, fines, and interest due; the nature and persistence of the violations; the extent of the respondent's culpability; the substantive or technical nature of the violations; the size, revenue, and human resources capacity of the respondent; the circumstances of each situation; the amount of penalties in similar situations; and other factors pursuant to rules issued by the Director.
2. A respondent found to be in violation of this Chapter 14.16 shall be liable for full payment of unpaid wages due, provided that the employee is not entitled to payment for lost tips or commissions for paid sick and paid safe time as defined in Section 14.16.010, plus interest in favor of the aggrieved party under the terms of this Chapter 14.16 and other equitable relief. For a first violation of this Chapter 14.16, the Director may assess liquidated damages in an additional amount of up to twice the unpaid wages. For subsequent violations of this Chapter 14.16, the Director shall assess liquidated damages in an additional amount of twice the unpaid wages. If the violation is ongoing when the Agency receives a complaint or opens an investigation, the Director may order payment of amounts that accrue after receipt of the complaint or after the investigation opens and before the date of the Director's Order. Interest shall accrue from the date the unpaid wages were first due at 12 percent per annum, or the maximum rate permitted under RCW 19.52.020. For purposes of this Section 14.16.080, a violation is a subsequent violation if at least one Director's Order has issued against the respondent in the ten years preceding the date of the violation; otherwise, it is a first violation.
3. A respondent found to be in violation of Section 14.16.055 for retaliation shall be subject to any appropriate relief at law or equity including, but not limited to reinstatement of the aggrieved party, front pay in lieu of reinstatement with full payment of unpaid wages plus interest in favor of the aggrieved party under the terms of this Chapter 14.16, and liquidated damages in an additional amount of up to twice the unpaid wages. The Director also shall order the imposition of a penalty payable to the aggrieved party of up to $5,000.
4. A respondent who willfully violates the notice and posting requirements of Section 14.16.045 shall be subject to a civil penalty of $750 for the first violation and $1,000 for subsequent violations.
5. A respondent who willfully hinders, prevents, impedes, or interferes with the Director or Hearing Examiner in the performance of their duties under this Chapter 14.16 shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000.
6. For a first violation of this Chapter 14.16, the Director may assess a civil penalty of up to $500 per aggrieved party. For a second violation of this Chapter 14.16, the Director shall assess a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per aggrieved party, or an amount equal to ten percent of the total amount of unpaid wages, whichever is greater. For a third or any subsequent violation of this Chapter 14.16, the Director shall assess a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per aggrieved party, or an amount equal to ten percent of the total amount of unpaid wages, whichever is greater. The maximum civil penalty for a violation of this Chapter 14.16 shall be $20,000 per aggrieved party, or an amount equal to ten percent of the total amount of unpaid wages, whichever is greater. For purposes of this Section 14.16.080, a violation is a second, third, or subsequent violation if the respondent has been a party to one, two, or more than two Settlement Agreements, respectively, stipulating that a violation has occurred; and/or one, two, ore more than two Director's Orders, respectively, have issued against the respondent in the ten years preceding the date of the violation; otherwise, it is a first violation.
7. For the following violations, the Director may assess a fine in the amounts set forth below:
8. In addition to the unpaid wages, penalties, fines, liquidated damages, and interest, the Agency may assess against the respondent in favor of the City the reasonable costs incurred in enforcing this Chapter 14.16, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees.
9. An employer that is the subject of a final order for which all appeal rights have been exhausted shall not be permitted to bid, or have a bid considered, on any City contract until such amounts due under the final order have been paid in full to the Director. If an employer is the subject of a final order two times or more within a five-year period, the contractor or subcontractor shall not be allowed to bid on any City contract for two years. This subsection 14.16.080.I shall be construed to provide grounds for debarment separate from, and in addition to, those contained in Chapter 20.70 and shall not be governed by that chapter provided that nothing in this subsection 14.16.080.I shall be construed to limit the application of Chapter 20.70. The Director shall notify the Director of Finance and Administrative Services of all employers subject to debarment under this subsection 14.16.080.I.

### 14.16.085 - Appeal period and failure to respond

1. An employee or other person who claims an injury as a result of an alleged violation of this Chapter 14.16 may appeal the Determination of No Violation Shown, pursuant to the rules of the Director.
2. A respondent may appeal the Director's Order, including all remedies issued pursuant to Section 14.16.080, by requesting a contested hearing before the Hearing Examiner in writing within 15 days of service of the Director's Order. If a respondent fails to appeal the Director's Order within 15 days of service, the Director's Order shall be final. If the last day of the appeal period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the appeal period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day.

### 14.16.090 - Appeal procedure and failure to appear

1. Contested hearings shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures for hearing contested cases contained in Section 3.02.090 and the rules adopted by the Hearing Examiner for hearing contested cases. The hearing shall be conducted de novo and the Director shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation or violations occurred. Upon establishing such proof, the remedies and penalties imposed by the Director shall be upheld unless it is shown that the Director abused discretion. Failure to appear for a contested hearing shall result in an order being entered finding that the respondent committed the violation stated in the Director's Order. For good cause shown and upon terms the Hearing Examiner deems just, the Hearing Examiner may set aside an order entered upon a failure to appear.
2. In all contested cases, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order affirming, modifying or reversing the Director's Order.

### 14.16.095 - Appeal from Hearing Examiner order

1. The respondent may obtain judicial review of the decision of the Hearing Examiner by applying for a Writ of Review in the King County Superior Court within 30 days from the date of the decision in accordance with the procedure set forth in chapter 7.16 RCW, other applicable law, and court rules.
2. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final and conclusive unless review is sought in compliance with this Section 14.16.095.

### 14.16.100 - Failure to comply with final order

1. If a respondent fails to comply within 30 days of service of any settlement agreement with the Agency, or with any final order issued by the Director or the Hearing Examiner for which all appeal rights have been exhausted, the Agency may pursue, but is not limited to, the following measures to secure compliance:

    1. The Director may require the respondent to post public notice of the respondent's failure to comply in a form and manner determined by the Agency.
    2. The Director may refer the matter to a collection agency. The cost to the City for the collection services will be assessed as costs, at the rate agreed to between the City and the collection agency, and added to the amounts due.
    3. The Director may refer the matter to the City Attorney for the filing of a civil action in King County Superior Court, the Seattle Municipal Court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such order or to collect amounts due. In the alternative, the Director may seek to enforce a Director's Order or a final order of the Hearing Examiner under Section 14.16.105.
    4. The Director may request that the City's Department of Finance and Administrative Services deny, suspend, refuse to renew, or revoke any business license held or requested by the employer or person until such time as the employer complies with the remedy as defined in the settlement agreement or final order. The City's Department of Finance and Administrative Services shall have the authority to deny, refuse to renew, or revoke any business license in accordance with this subsection 14.16.100.A.4.
2. No respondent that is the subject of a final order issued under this Chapter 14.16 shall quit business, sell out, exchange, convey, or otherwise dispose of the respondent's business or stock of goods without first notifying the Agency and without first notifying the respondent's successor of the amounts owed under the final order at least three business days prior to such transaction. At the time the respondent quits business, or sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of the respondent's business or stock of goods, the full amount of the remedy, as defined in a final order issued by the Director or the Hearing Examiner, shall become immediately due and payable. If the amount due under the final order is not paid by respondent within ten days from the date of such sale, exchange, conveyance, or disposal, the successor shall become liable for the payment of the amount due, provided that the successor has actual knowledge of the order and the amounts due or has prompt, reasonable, and effective means of accessing and verifying the fact and amount of the order and the amounts due. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay the amount of the full remedy. When the successor makes such payment, that payment shall be deemed a payment upon the purchase price in the amount paid, and if such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price the amount of the difference shall become a debt due such successor from the employer.

### 14.16.105 - Debt owed The City of Seattle

1. All monetary amounts due under the Director's Order shall be a debt owed to the City and may be collected in the same manner as any other debt in like amount, which remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies, provided that amounts collected by the City for unpaid wages, liquidated damages, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, or front pay shall be held in trust by the City for the aggrieved party and, once collected by the City, shall be paid by the City to the aggrieved party.
2. If a respondent fails to appeal a Director's Order to the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.16.085.B, the Director's Order shall be final, and the Director may petition the Seattle Municipal Court, or any court of competent jurisdiction, to enforce the Director's Order by entering judgment in favor of the City finding that the respondent has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and that all amounts and relief contained in the order are due. The Director's Order shall constitute prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 containing evidence that the respondent has failed to comply with the order or any parts thereof, and is therefore in default, or that the respondent has failed to appeal the Director's Order to the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.16.085.B, and therefore has failed to exhaust the respondent's administrative remedies, shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation.
3. If a respondent fails to obtain judicial review of an order of the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.16.095.A, the order of the Hearing Examiner shall be final, and the Director may petition the Seattle Municipal Court to enforce the Director's Order by entering judgment in favor of the City for all amounts and relief due under the order of the Hearing Examiner. The order of the Hearing Examiner shall constitute conclusive evidence that the violations contained therein occurred and shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 containing evidence that the respondent has failed to comply with the order or any parts thereof, and is therefore in default, or that the respondent has failed to avail itself of judicial review in accordance with subsection 14.16.095.A, shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation.
4. In considering matters brought under subsections 14.16.105.B and 14.16.105.C, the Municipal Court may include within its judgment all terms, conditions, and remedies contained in the Director's Order or the order of the Hearing Examiner, whichever is applicable, that are consistent with the provisions of this Chapter 14.16.

### 14.16.110 - Private right of action

1. Effective April 1, 2016, for claims against employers that employ 50 or more employees and effective April 1, 2017 for claims against employers that employ fewer than 50 employees, any person or class of persons that suffers financial injury as a result of a violation of this Chapter 14.16 or is the subject of prohibited retaliation under Section 14.16.080, may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the employer or other person violating this Chapter 14.16 and, upon prevailing, may be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs and such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to remedy the violation including, without limitation: the payment of any unpaid wages plus interest due to the person and liquidated damages in an additional amount of up to twice the unpaid wages; and a penalty payable to any aggrieved party of up to $5000 if the aggrieved party was subject to prohibited retaliation. Interest shall accrue from the date the unpaid wages were first due at 12 percent per annum, or the maximum rate permitted under RCW 19.52.020.
2. For purposes of determining employer size for this Section 14.16.110,

    1. An employee who is not covered by this Chapter 14.16 shall be included in any determination of employer size.
    2. Employer size for the current calendar year will be calculated based upon the average number per calendar week of employees who worked for compensation during the preceding calendar year for any and all weeks during which at least one employee worked for compensation. For employers that did not have any employees during the previous calendar year, the employer size will be calculated based upon the average number per calendar week of employees who worked for compensation during the first 90 calendar days of the current year in which the employer engaged in business.
    3. All employees who worked for compensation shall be counted, including but not limited to:

        1. Employees who worked inside the City;
        2. Employees who worked outside the City; and
        3. Employees who worked in full-time employment, part-time employment, joint employment, temporary employment, or through the services of a temporary services or staffing agency or similar entity.
    4. Separate entities that form an integrated enterprise shall be considered a single employer under this Chapter 14.16. Separate entities will be considered an integrated enterprise and a single employer under this Chapter 14.16 where a separate entity controls the operation of another entity. The factors to consider in making this assessment include, but are not limited to:

        1. Degree of interrelation between the operations of multiple entities;
        2. Degree to which the entities share common management;
        3. Centralized control of labor relations; and
        4. Degree of common ownership or financial control over the entities.
3. For purposes of this Section 14.16.110, "person" includes any entity a member of which has suffered financial injury or retaliation, or any other individual or entity acting on behalf of an aggrieved party that has suffered financial injury or retaliation.
4. For purposes of determining membership within a class of persons entitled to bring an action under this Section 14.16.110, two or more employees are similarly situated if they:

    1. Are or were employed by the same employer or employers, whether concurrently or otherwise, at some point during the applicable statute of limitations period,
    2. Allege one or more violations that raise similar questions as to liability, and
    3. Seek similar forms of relief.
5. For purposes of subsection 14.16.110.D, employees shall not be considered dissimilar solely because their

    1. Claims seek damages that differ in amount, or
    2. Job titles or other means of classifying employees differ in ways that are unrelated to their claims.

### 14.16.115 - Encouragement of more generous policies

1. Nothing in this Chapter 14.16 shall be construed to discourage or prohibit an employer from the adoption or retention of a paid sick and paid safe time policy more generous than the one required herein.
2. Nothing in this Chapter 14.16 shall be construed as diminishing the obligation of an employer to comply with any contract, collective bargaining agreement, employment benefit plan, or other agreement providing more generous sick and paid safe time to an employee than required herein.
3. Nothing in this Chapter 14.16 shall be construed as diminishing the rights of public employees regarding paid sick or paid safe time or use of sick or paid safe time as provided under federal or Washington state law or the Seattle Municipal Code.

### 14.16.120 - Waiver; Effect on collective bargaining rights

The provisions of this Chapter 14.16 shall not apply to any employees covered by a bona fide collective bargaining agreement to the extent that such requirements are expressly waived in the collective bargaining agreement in clear and unambiguous terms.

Any waiver by an individual of any provisions of this Chapter 14.16 shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable.


### 14.16.125 - Other legal requirements

1. This Chapter 14.16 provides minimum requirements pertaining to paid sick and paid safe time and shall not be construed to preempt, limit, or otherwise affect the applicability of any other law, regulation, requirement, policy, or standard that provides for greater accrual or use by employees of sick or safe time, whether paid or unpaid, or that extends other protections to employees; and nothing in this Chapter 14.16 shall be interpreted or applied so as to create any power or duty in conflict with federal or state law. Nor shall this Chapter 14.16 be construed to preclude any person aggrieved from seeking judicial review of any final administrative decision or order made under this Chapter 14.16 affecting such person.
2. The paid sick and paid safe time required by this Chapter 14.16 is in addition to a contractor's obligations under 41 U.S.C. chapter 67 (Service Contract Act) and 40 U.S.C. chapter 31, subchapter IV (Davis-Bacon Act), or under chapter 39.12 RCW and contractors may not receive credit toward their prevailing wage or fringe benefit obligations under those Acts and Washington state law for any paid sick and paid safe time provided in satisfaction of the requirements of this Chapter 14.16. A contractor's existing paid leave policy provided in addition to the fulfillment of those Acts and Washington state law obligations, if applicable, and made available to all employees covered by this Chapter 14.16, will satisfy the requirements of this Chapter 14.16 provided that:

    1. Available paid leave may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as paid sick and paid safe time as set forth in this Chapter 14.16; and
    2. Paid leave is accrued at the rate consistent with this Chapter 14.16; and
    3. Use of paid leave within any benefit year is limited to no less than the amounts specified in this Chapter 14.16; and

The provisions of this Chapter 14.16 are declared to be separate and severable. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, subsection, or portion of this Chapter 14.16, or the application thereof to any employer, employee, person, or circumstance, is held to be invalid, it shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Chapter 14.16, or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

1. No employer or any other person shall interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of, or the attempt to exercise, any right protected under this Chapter 14.17.

4. It shall be a rebuttable presumption of retaliation if an employer or any other person takes an adverse action against a person within 90 days of the person's exercise of rights protected in this Section 14.17.030. However, in the case of seasonal work that ended before the close of the 90 day period, the presumption also applies if the employer fails to rehire a former employee at the next opportunity for work in the same position. The employer may rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the adverse action was taken for a permissible purpose.
5. Standard of proof. Proof of retaliation under this Section 14.17.030 shall be sufficient upon a showing that an employer or any other person has taken an adverse action against a person and the person's exercise of rights protected in this Section 14.17.030 was a motivating factor in the adverse action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such protected activity.
6. The protections afforded under this Section 14.17.030 shall apply to any person who mistakenly but in good faith alleges violations of this Chapter 14.17.

6. Upon the written request of an employer, the Director has the authority to extend the implementation date for that employer, for a reasonable amount of time, to provide the employer time to make the necessary changes to their employment systems or forms.

### 14.17.040 - Violation

The failure of any respondent to comply with any requirement imposed on the respondent under this Chapter 14.17 is a violation.


### 14.17.045 - Investigation

1. The Agency shall have the power to investigate any violations of this Chapter 14.17 by any respondent. The Agency may initiate an investigation pursuant to rules issued by the Director including, but not limited to, situations when the Director has reason to believe that a violation has occurred or will occur, when circumstances show that violations are likely to occur within a class of businesses because the workforce contains significant numbers of workers who are vulnerable to violations of this Chapter 14.17 or the workforce is unlikely to volunteer information regarding such violations. An investigation may also be initiated through the receipt by the Agency of a report or complaint filed by an employee or other person.
2. An employee or other person may report to the Agency any suspected violation of this Chapter 14.17. The Agency shall encourage reporting pursuant to this Section 14.17.045 by taking the following measures:

    1. The Agency shall keep confidential, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, the name and other identifying information of the employee or person reporting the violation. However, with the authorization of such person, the Agency may disclose the employee's or person's name and identifying information as necessary to enforce this Chapter 14.17 or for other appropriate purposes.
    2. An employer must post or otherwise notify its employees that the Agency is conducting an investigation, using a form provided by the Agency and displaying it on-site, in a conspicuous and accessible location, and in English and the primary language of the employee(s) at the particular workplace. If display of the form is not feasible, including situations when the employee works remotely or does not have a regular workplace, employers may provide the form on an individual basis in the employee's primary language in physical or electronic format that is reasonably conspicuous and accessible.
    3. The Agency may certify the eligibility of eligible persons for "U" Visas under the provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1184.p and 8 U.S.C. § 1101.a.15.U. This certification is subject to applicable federal law and regulations, and rules issued by the Director.
3. The Agency's investigation must commence within three years of the alleged violation. To the extent permitted by law, the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions is tolled during any investigation under this Chapter 14.17 and any administrative enforcement proceeding under this Chapter 14.17 based upon the same facts. For purposes of this Chapter 14.17:

    1. The Agency's investigation begins on the earlier date of when the Agency receives a complaint from a person under this Chapter 14.17, or the Agency opens an investigation under this Chapter 14.17.
    2. The Agency's investigation ends when the Agency issues a final order concluding the matter and any appeals have been exhausted; the time to file any appeal has expired; or the Agency notifies the respondent in writing that the investigation has been otherwise resolved.
4. The Agency's investigation shall be conducted in an objective and impartial manner.
5. The Director may apply by affidavit or declaration in the form allowed under RCW 9A.72.085 to the Hearing Examiner for the issuance of subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or for the production of documents relevant to the issue of whether an employer has violated any provision of this Chapter 14.17. The Hearing Examiner shall conduct the review without hearing as soon as practicable and shall issue subpoenas upon a showing that there is reason to believe that a violation has occurred if a complaint has been filed with the Agency, or that circumstances show that violations are likely to occur within a class of businesses because the workforce contains significant numbers of workers who are vulnerable to violations of this Chapter 14.17 or the workforce is unlikely to volunteer information regarding such violations.
6. An employer that fails to comply with the terms of any subpoena issued under subsection 14.17.045.E. in an investigation by the Agency under this Chapter 14.17 prior to the issuance of a Director's Order issued pursuant to subsection 14.17.050.C may not use such records in any appeal to challenge the correctness of any determination by the Agency of damages owed or penalties assessed.
7. In addition to other remedies, the Director may refer any subpoena issued under subsection 14.17.045.E to the City Attorney to seek a court order to enforce any subpoena.
8. Where the Director has reason to believe that a violation has occurred, the Director may order any appropriate temporary or interim relief to mitigate the violation or maintain the status quo pending completion of a full investigation or hearing, including but not limited to a deposit of funds or bond sufficient to satisfy a good-faith estimate of wages, interest, damages and penalties due. A respondent may appeal any such order in accordance with subsection 14.17.060.B.

### 14.17.050 - Findings of fact and determination

1. Except when there is an agreed upon settlement, the Director shall issue a written determination with findings of fact resulting from the investigation and statement of whether a violation of this Chapter 14.17 has or has not occurred based on a preponderance of the evidence before the Director.
2. If the Director determines that there is no violation of this Chapter 14.17, the Director shall issue a "Determination of No Violation" with notice of an employee or other person's right to appeal the decision, subject to the rules of the Director.
3. If the Director determines that a violation of this Chapter 14.17 has occurred, the Director shall issue a "Director's Order" that shall include a notice of violation identifying the violation or violations. The Director's Order shall state with specificity the amounts due under this Chapter 14.17 for each violation, including payment of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, fines, and interest pursuant to Section 14.17.055. The Director's Order may specify that civil penalties and fines due to the Agency can be mitigated for respondent's timely payment of remedy due to an aggrieved party under subsection 14.17.055.A.2. The Director's Order may direct the respondent to take such corrective action as is necessary to comply with the requirements of this Chapter 14.17, including, but not limited to, monitored compliance for a reasonable time period. The Director's Order shall include notice of the respondent's right to appeal the decision, pursuant to Section 14.17.060.

### 14.17.055 - Remedies

The fine amounts shall be increased cumulatively by 50 percent of the fine for each preceding violation for each subsequent violation of the same provision by the same employer or person within a ten year period. The maximum amount that may be imposed in fines in any one year period for each type of violation listed above is $5,000 unless a fine for retaliation is issued, in which case the maximum amount is $20,000.


1. The payment of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, fines, and interest provided under this Chapter 14.17 are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of any other available remedies, penalties, fines, and procedures.

    1. Effective January 1, 2017, the amounts of all civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, and fines contained in this Section 14.17.055 shall be increased annually to reflect the rate of inflation and calculated to the nearest cent on January 1 of each year thereafter. The Agency shall determine the amounts and file a schedule of such amounts with the City Clerk.
    2. If there is a remedy due to an aggrieved party, the Director may waive the total amount of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency if the Director determines that the respondent paid the full remedy due to the aggrieved party within ten days of service of the Director's Order. The Director may waive half the amount of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency if the Director determines that the respondent paid the full remedy due to the aggrieved party within 15 days of service of the Director's Order.

2. If a violation is ongoing when the Agency receives a complaint or opens an investigation, the Director may order payment of amounts that accrue after receipt of the complaint or after the investigation opens and before the date of the Director's Order. Interest shall accrue from the date the unpaid wages were first due at 12 percent per annum, or the maximum rate permitted under RCW 19.52.020.
3. A respondent found to be in violation of this Chapter 14.17 for retaliation under Section 14.17.040 shall be subject to any appropriate relief at law or equity including, but not limited to reinstatement of the aggrieved party, front pay in lieu of reinstatement with full payment of unpaid wages plus interest in favor of the aggrieved party under the terms of this Chapter 14.17, and liquidated damages in an additional amount of up to twice the unpaid wages.

If the last day of the appeal period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the appeal period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day.

### 14.17.065 - Appeal procedure and failure to appear

1. Contested hearings shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures for hearing contested cases contained in Section 3.02.090 and the rules adopted by the Hearing Examiner for hearing contested cases. The review shall be conducted de novo and the Director shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation or violations occurred. Upon establishing such proof, the remedies and penalties imposed by the Director shall be upheld unless it is shown that the Director abused discretion. Failure to appear for a contested hearing shall result in an order being entered finding that the respondent committed the violation stated in the Director's Order. For good cause shown and upon terms the Hearing Examiner deems just, the Hearing Examiner may set aside an order entered upon a failure to appear.
2. In all contested cases, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order affirming, modifying or reversing the Director's Order.

### 14.17.070 - Appeal from Hearing Examiner order

1. The respondent may obtain judicial review of the decision of the Hearing Examiner by applying for a Writ of Review in the King County Superior Court within 30 days from the date of the decision in accordance with the procedure set forth in chapter 7.16 RCW, other applicable law, and court rules.
2. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final and conclusive unless review is sought in compliance with this Section 14.17.070.

### 14.17.075 - Failure to comply with final order

1. If a respondent fails to comply within 30 days of service of any settlement agreement with the Agency, or with any final order issued by the Director or the Hearing Examiner for which all appeal rights have been exhausted, the Agency may pursue, but is not limited to, the following measures to secure compliance:

    1. The Director may require the respondent to post public notice of the respondent's failure to comply in a form and manner determined by the Agency.
    2. The Director may refer the matter to a collection agency. The cost to the City for the collection services will be assessed as costs, at the rate agreed to between the City and the collection agency, and added to the amounts due.
    3. The Director may refer the matter to the City Attorney for the filing of a civil action in King County Superior Court, the Seattle Municipal Court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such order or to collect amounts due. In the alternative, the Director may seek to enforce a Director's Order or a final order of the Hearing Examiner under Section 14.17.080.
    4. The Director may request that the City's Department of Finance and Administrative Services deny, suspend, refuse to renew, or revoke any business license held or requested by the employer or person until such time as the employer complies with the remedy as defined in the settlement agreement or final order. The City's Department of Finance and Administrative Services shall have the authority to deny, refuse to renew, or revoke any business license in accordance with this subsection 14.17.075.A.4.
2. No respondent that is the subject of a final order issued under this Chapter 14.17 shall quit business, sell out, exchange, convey, or otherwise dispose of the respondent's business or stock of goods without first notifying the Agency and without first notifying the respondent's successor of the amounts owed under the final order at least three business days prior to such transaction. At the time the respondent quits business, or sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of the respondent's business or stock of goods, the full amount of the remedy, as defined in a final order issued by the Director or the Hearing Examiner, shall become immediately due and payable. If the amount due under the final order is not paid by respondent within ten days from the date of such sale, exchange, conveyance, or disposal, the successor shall become liable for the payment of the amount due, provided that the successor has actual knowledge of the order and the amounts due or has prompt, reasonable, and effective means of accessing and verifying the fact and amount of the order and the amounts due. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay the amount of the full remedy. When the successor makes such payment, that payment shall be deemed a payment upon the purchase price in the amount paid, and if such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price the amount of the difference shall become a debt due such successor from the employer.

### 14.17.080 - Debt owed The City of Seattle

1. All monetary amounts due under the Director's Order shall be a debt owed to the City and may be collected in the same manner as any other debt in like amount, which remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies, provided that amounts collected by the City for unpaid wages, liquidated damages, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, or front pay shall be held in trust by the City for the aggrieved party and, once collected by the City, shall be paid by the City to the aggrieved party.
2. If a respondent fails to appeal a Director's Order to the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.17.060.B, the Director's Order shall be final, and the Director may petition the Seattle Municipal Court, or any court of competent jurisdiction, to enforce the Director's Order by entering judgment in favor of the City finding that the respondent has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and that all amounts and relief contained in the order are due. The Director's Order shall constitute prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 containing evidence that the respondent has failed to comply with the order or any parts thereof, and is therefore in default, or that the respondent has failed to appeal the Director's Order to the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.17.060.B, and therefore has failed to exhaust the respondent's administrative remedies, shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation.
3. If a respondent fails to obtain judicial review of an order of the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.17.070.A, the order of the Hearing Examiner shall be final, and the Director may petition the Seattle Municipal Court to enforce the Director's Order by entering judgment in favor of the City for all amounts and relief due under the order of the Hearing Examiner. The order of the Hearing Examiner shall constitute conclusive evidence that the violations contained therein occurred and shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 containing evidence that the respondent has failed to comply with the order or any parts thereof, and is therefore in default, or that the respondent has failed to avail itself of judicial review in accordance with subsection 14.17.070.A, shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation.
4. In considering matters brought under subsections 14.17.080.B and 14.17.080.C, the Municipal Court may include within its judgment all terms, conditions, and remedies contained in the Director's Order or the order of the Hearing Examiner, whichever is applicable, that are consistent with the provisions of this Chapter 14.17.

### 14.17.085 - Effect on collective bargaining rights

This Chapter 14.17 shall not be construed to interfere with, impede, or in any way diminish any provision in a collective bargaining agreement or the right of employees to bargain collectively with their employers through representatives of their own choosing concerning wages or standards or conditions of employment.

This Chapter 14.17 shall not be interpreted or applied to diminish or conflict with any requirements of state or federal law, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681 et. seq., as amended, the Washington State Fair Credit Reporting Act, chapter 19.182 RCW, as amended, the Washington State Criminal Records Privacy Act, chapter 10.97 RCW, as amended, and state laws regarding criminal background checks, including those related to individuals with access to children or vulnerable persons, RCW 43.43.830 et seq., as amended.

There shall be a presumption that separate legal entities, which may share some degree of interrelated operations and common management with one another, shall be considered separate employers for purposes of this Section 14.19.020 as long as (1) the separate legal entities operate substantially in separate physical locations from one another, and (2) each separate legal entity has partially different ultimate ownership.


1. An employee who is not covered by this Chapter 14.19 shall be included in any determination of the size of the employer.

For employers that did not have any employees during the previous calendar year, the employer schedule will be calculated based upon the average number of employees who worked for compensation per calendar week during the first 90 calendar days of the current year in which the employer engaged in business.

Prior to issuance, an applicant for a special certificate must secure a letter of recommendation from the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries stating that the application has a demonstrated necessity pursuant to WAC 296-128.

Where an employee is paid a bonus, the amount of the bonus in each work-week period may be credited as a part of the total wage for that period, and the total wages paid for such period shall be computed on the hours worked in that period resulting in no less than the applicable minimum wage rate.

The Agency shall create and distribute the poster in English, Spanish, and any other languages that are necessary for employers to comply with subsection 14.19.045.B.

    2. The right to be protected from retaliation for exercising in good faith the rights protected by this Chapter 14.19; and
    3. The right to file a complaint with the Agency or bring a civil action for violation of the requirements of this Chapter 14.19, including an employer or any person's failure to pay minimum wage or minimum compensation, and an employer or other person's retaliation against an employee or other person for engaging in an activity protected by this Chapter 14.19.
2. Employers shall display the poster in a conspicuous and accessible place at any workplace or job site where any of their employees work. Employers shall display the poster in English and in the primary language of the employee(s) at the particular workplace. If display of the poster is not feasible, including situations when the employee works remotely or does not have a regular workplace or job site, employers may provide the poster on an individual basis in an employee's primary language in physical or electronic format that is reasonably conspicuous and accessible.

### 14.19.050 - Employer records

1. Each employer shall retain records documenting minimum wages and minimum compensation paid to each employee. Such records shall be retained for a period of three years from the date such hours were worked.
2. If an employer fails to retain adequate records required under subsection 14.19.050.A, there shall be a presumption, rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer violated this Chapter 14.19 for the periods and for each employee for whom records were not retained.
3. Respondents in any case closed by the Agency shall allow the Office of City Auditor access to such records to permit the Office of City Auditor to evaluate the Agency's enforcement efforts. Before requesting records from such a respondent, the Office of City Auditor shall first consult the Agency's respondent records on file and determine if additional records are necessary. The City Auditor may apply by affidavit or declaration in the form allowed under RCW 9A.72.085 to the Hearing Examiner for the issuance of subpoenas under this subsection 14.19.050.C. The Hearing Examiner shall issue such subpoenas upon a showing that the records are required to fulfill the purpose of this subsection 14.19.050.C.

### 14.19.055 - Retaliation prohibited

1. No employer or any other person shall interfere with, restrain, deny, or attempt to deny the exercise of any right protected under this Chapter 14.19.
2. No employer or any other person shall take any adverse action against any person because the person has exercised in good faith the rights protected under this Chapter 14.19. Such rights include but are not limited to the right to make inquiries about the rights protected under this Chapter 14.19; the right to inform others about their rights under this Chapter 14.19; the right to inform the person's employer, union, or similar organization, and/or the person's legal counsel or any other person about an alleged violation of this Chapter 14.19; the right to file an oral or written complaint with the Agency or bring a civil action for an alleged violation of this Chapter 14.19; the right to cooperate with the Agency in its investigations of this Chapter 14.19; the right to testify in a proceeding under or related to this Chapter 14.19; the right to refuse to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of city, state, or federal law; and the right to oppose any policy, practice, or act that is unlawful under this Chapter 14.19.
3. No employer or any other person shall communicate to a person exercising rights protected under this Section 14.19.055, directly or indirectly, the willingness to inform a government employee that the person is not lawfully in the United States, or to report, or to make an implied or express assertion of a willingness to report, suspected citizenship or immigration status of an employee or a family member of the employee to a federal, state, or local agency because the employee has exercised a right under this Chapter 14.19.
4. It shall be a rebuttable presumption of retaliation if an employer or any other person takes an adverse action against a person within 90 days of the person's exercise of rights protected in this Section 14.19.055. However, in the case of seasonal work that ended before the close of the 90 day period, the presumption also applies if the employer fails to rehire a former employee at the next opportunity for work in the same position. The employer may rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the adverse action was taken for a permissible purpose.
5. Standard of proof. Proof of retaliation under this Section 14.19.055 shall be sufficient upon a showing that an employer or any other person has taken an adverse action against a person and the person's exercise of rights protected in this Section 14.19.055 was a motivating factor in the adverse action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such protected activity.
6. The protections afforded under this Section 14.19.055 shall apply to any person who mistakenly but in good faith alleges violations of this Chapter 14.19.
7. A complaint or other communication by any person triggers the protections of this Section 14.19.055 regardless of whether the complaint or communication is in writing or makes explicit reference to this Chapter 14.19.

### 14.19.060 - Enforcement power and duties

1. The Agency shall investigate violations of this Chapter 14.19 as defined herein, and shall have such powers and duties in the performance of these functions as are defined in this Chapter 14.19 and otherwise necessary and proper in the performance of the same and provided for by law.
2. The Agency shall be authorized to coordinate implementation and enforcement of this Chapter 14.19 and shall promulgate appropriate guidelines or rules for such purposes.
3. The Director of the Agency is authorized and directed to promulgate rules consistent with this Chapter 14.19 and the Administrative Code. Any guidelines or rules promulgated by the Director shall have the force and effect of law and may be relied on by employers, employees, and other parties to determine their rights and responsibilities under this Chapter 14.19.

### 14.19.065 - Violation

The failure of any respondent to comply with any requirement imposed on the respondent under this Chapter 14.19 is a violation.


### 14.19.070 - Investigation

1. The Agency shall have the power to investigate any violations of this Chapter 14.19 by any respondent. The Agency may initiate an investigation pursuant to rules issued by the Director including, but not limited to, situations when the Director has reason to believe that a violation has occurred or will occur, or when circumstances show that violations are likely to occur within a class of businesses because the workforce contains significant numbers of workers who are vulnerable to violations of this Chapter 14.19 or the workforce is unlikely to volunteer information regarding such violations. An investigation may also be initiated through the receipt by the Agency of a report or complaint filed by an employee or any other person.
2. An employee or other person may report to the Agency any suspected violation of this Chapter 14.19. The Agency shall encourage reporting pursuant to this Section 14.19.070 by taking the following measures:

    1. The Agency shall keep confidential, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, the name and other identifying information of the employee or person reporting the violation. However, with the authorization of such person, the Agency may disclose the employee's or person's name and identifying information as necessary to enforce this Chapter 14.19 or for other appropriate purposes.
    2. An employer must post or otherwise notify its employees that the Agency is conducting an investigation, using a form provided by the Agency and displaying it on-site, in a conspicuous and accessible location, and in English and the primary language of the employee(s) at the particular workplace. If display of the form is not feasible, including situations when the employee works remotely or does not have a regular workplace, employers may provide the form on an individual basis in the employee's primary language in physical or electronic format that is reasonably conspicuous and accessible.
    3. The Agency may certify the eligibility of eligible persons for "U" Visas under the provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1184.p and 8 U.S.C. § 1101.a.15.U. This certification is subject to applicable federal law and regulations, and rules issued by the Director.
3. The Agency's investigation must commence within three years of the alleged violation. To the extent permitted by law, the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions is tolled during any investigation under this Chapter 14.19 and any administrative enforcement proceeding under this Chapter 14.19 based upon the same facts. For purposes of this Chapter 14.19:

    1. The Agency's investigation begins on the earlier date of when the Agency receives a complaint from a person under this Chapter 14.19, or the Agency opens an investigation under this Chapter 14.19.
    2. The Agency's investigation ends when the Agency issues a final order concluding the matter and any appeals have been exhausted; the time to file any appeal has expired; or the Agency notifies the respondent in writing that the investigation has been otherwise resolved.
4. The Agency's investigation shall be conducted in an objective and impartial manner.
5. The Director may apply by affidavit or declaration in the form allowed under RCW 9A.72.085 to the Hearing Examiner for the issuance of subpoenas requiring an employer to produce the records identified in subsection 14.19.050.A, or for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or for the production of documents required to be retained under subsection 14.19.050.A or any other document relevant to the issue of whether any employee or group of employees has been or is afforded proper amounts of compensation under this Chapter 14.19 and/or to whether an employer has violated any provision of this Chapter 14.19. The Hearing Examiner shall conduct the review without hearing as soon as practicable and shall issue subpoenas upon a showing that there is reason to believe that a violation has occurred if a complaint has been filed with the Agency, or that circumstances show that violations are likely to occur within a class of businesses because the workforce contains significant numbers of workers who are vulnerable to violations of this Chapter 14.19 or the workforce is unlikely to volunteer information regarding such violations.
6. An employer that fails to comply with the terms of any subpoena issued under subsection 14.19.070.E. in an investigation by the Agency under this Chapter 14.19 prior to the issuance of a Director's Order issued pursuant to subsection 14.19.075.C may not use such records in any appeal to challenge the correctness of any determination by the Agency of damages owed or penalties assessed.
7. In addition to other remedies, the Director may refer any subpoena issued under subsection 14.19.070.E to the City Attorney to seek a court order to enforce any subpoena.
8. Where the Director has reason to believe that a violation has occurred, the Director may order any appropriate temporary or interim relief to mitigate the violation or maintain the status quo pending completion of a full investigation or hearing, including but not limited to a deposit of funds or bond sufficient to satisfy a good-faith estimate of wages, interest, damages and penalties due. A respondent may appeal any such order in accordance with subsection 14.19.085.B.

### 14.19.075 - Findings of fact and determination

1. Except when there is an agreed upon settlement, the Director shall issue a written determination with findings of fact resulting from the investigation and statement of whether a violation of this Chapter 14.19 has or has not occurred based on a preponderance of the evidence before the Director.
2. If the Director determines that there is no violation of this Chapter 14.19, the Director shall issue a "Determination of No Violation" with notice of an employee or other person's right to appeal the decision, subject to the rules of the Director.
3. If the Director determines that a violation of this Chapter 14.19 has occurred, the Director shall issue a "Director's Order" that shall include a notice of violation identifying the violation or violations. The Director's Order shall state with specificity the amounts due under this Chapter 14.19 for each violation, including payment of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, fines, and interest pursuant to Section 14.19.080. The Director's Order may specify that civil penalties and fines due to the Agency can be mitigated for respondent's timely payment of remedy due to an aggrieved party under subsection 14.19.080.A.2. The Director's Order may direct the respondent to take such corrective action as is necessary to comply with the requirements of this Chapter 14.19, including, but not limited to, monitored compliance for a reasonable time period. The Director's Order shall include notice of the respondent's right to appeal the decision, pursuant to subsection 14.19.085.
4. If the Director has a reasonable belief that a notice of violation for this Chapter 14.19 also indicates a violation of Section 12A.08.060, the Director may refer the complaint to the Seattle Police Department for further investigation or to the City Attorney's Office for prosecution.

### 14.19.080 - Remedies

The fine amounts shall be increased cumulatively by 50 percent of the fine for each preceding violation for each subsequent violation of the same provision by the same employer or person within a ten-year period. The maximum amount that may be imposed in fines in any one year period for each type of violation listed above is $5,000 unless a fine for retaliation is issued, in which case the maximum amount is $20,000.


1. The payment of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, fines, and interest provided under this Chapter 14.19 are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of any other available remedies, penalties, fines, and procedures.

    1. Effective January 1, 2017, the amounts of all civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, and fines contained in this Section 14.19.080 shall be increased annually to reflect the rate of inflation and calculated to the nearest cent on January 1 of each year thereafter. The Agency shall determine the amounts and file a schedule of such amounts with the City Clerk.
    2. If there is a remedy due to an aggrieved party, the Director may waive the total amount of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency if the Director determines that the respondent paid the full remedy due to the aggrieved party within ten days of service of the Director's Order. The Director may waive half the amount of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency if the Director determines that the respondent paid the full remedy due to the aggrieved party within 15 days of service of the Director's Order. The Director shall not waive any amount of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency if the Director determines that the respondent has not paid the full remedy due to the aggrieved party after 15 days of service of the Director's Order.
    3. When determining the amount of liquidated damages, civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, and fines due under this Section 14.19.080, for a Settlement Agreement or Director's Order, including but not limited to the mitigation of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency for timely payment of remedy due to an aggrieved party under subsection 14.19.080.A.2, the Director shall consider the total amount of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, penalties, fines, and interest due; the nature and persistence of the violations; the extent of the respondent's culpability; the substantive or technical nature of the violations; the size, revenue, and human resources capacity of the respondent; the circumstances of each situation; the amounts of penalties in similar situations; and other factors pursuant to rules issued by the Director.
2. A respondent found to be in violation of this Chapter 14.19 shall be liable for full payment of unpaid wages plus interest in favor of the aggrieved party under the terms of this Chapter 14.19 and other equitable relief. For a first violation of this Chapter 14.19, the Director may assess liquidated damages in an additional amount of up to twice the unpaid wages. For subsequent violations of this Chapter 14.19, the Director shall assess an amount of liquidated damages in an additional amount of twice the unpaid wages. If the violation is ongoing when the Agency receives a complaint or opens an investigation, the Director may order payment of amounts that accrue after receipt of the complaint or after the investigation opens and before the date of the Director's Order. Interest shall accrue from the date the unpaid wages were first due at 12 percent per annum, or the maximum rate permitted under RCW 19.52.020. For purposes of this Section 14.19.080, a violation is a subsequent violation if at least one Director's Order has issued against the respondent in the ten years preceding the date of the violation; otherwise, it is a first violation.
3. A respondent found to be in violation of Section 14.19.080 for retaliation shall be subject to any appropriate relief at law or equity including but not limited to reinstatement of the aggrieved party, front pay in lieu of reinstatement with full payment of unpaid wages plus interest in favor of the aggrieved party under the terms of this Chapter 14.19, and liquidated damages in an additional amount of up to twice the unpaid wages. The Director also shall order the imposition of a penalty payable to the aggrieved party of up to $5,000.
4. A respondent who willfully violates the notice and posting requirements of Section 14.19.045 shall be subject to a civil penalty of $750 for the first violation and $1,000 for subsequent violations.
5. A respondent who willfully hinders, prevents, impedes, or interferes with the Director or Hearing Examiner in the performance of their duties under this Chapter 14.19 shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000.
6. For a first violation of this Chapter 14.19, the Director may assess a civil penalty of up to $500 per aggrieved party. For a second violation of this Chapter 14.19, the Director shall assess a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per aggrieved party, or an amount equal to ten percent of the total amount of unpaid wages, whichever is greater. For a third or any subsequent violation of this Chapter 14.19, the Director shall assess a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per aggrieved party, or an amount equal to ten percent of the total amount of unpaid wages, whichever is greater. The maximum civil penalty for a violation of this Chapter 14.19 shall be $20,000 per aggrieved party, or an amount equal to ten percent of the total amount of unpaid wages, whichever is greater. For purposes of this Section 14.19.080, a violation is a second, third, or subsequent violation if the respondent has been a party to one, two, or more than two Settlement Agreements, respectively, stipulating that a violation has occurred; and/or one, two, or more than two Director's Orders, respectively, have issued against the respondent in the ten years preceding the date of the violation; otherwise, it is a first violation.
7. For the following violations, the Director may assess a fine in the amounts set forth below:
8. In addition to the unpaid wages, penalties, fines, liquidated damages, and interest, the Agency may assess against the respondent in favor of the City reasonable costs incurred in enforcing this Chapter 14.19, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees.
9. An employer that is the subject of a final order for which all appeal rights have been exhausted shall not be permitted to bid, or have a bid considered, on any City contract until such amounts due under the final order have been paid in full to the Director. If an employer is the subject of a final order two times or more within a five-year period, the contractor or subcontractor shall not be allowed to bid on any City contract for two years. This subsection 14.19.080.I shall be construed to provide grounds for debarment separate from, and in addition to, those contained in Chapter 20.70 and shall not be governed by that chapter provided that nothing in this subsection 14.16.080.I shall be construed to limit the application of Chapter 20.70. The Director shall notify the Director of Finance and Administrative Services of all employers subject to debarment under this subsection 14.19.080.I.

### 14.19.085 - Appeal period and failure to respond

1. An employee or other person who claims an injury as a result of an alleged violation of this Chapter 14.19 may appeal the Determination of No Violation Shown, pursuant to the rules of the Director.
2. A respondent may appeal the Director's Order, including all remedies issued pursuant to Section 14.19.080, by requesting a contested hearing before the Hearing Examiner in writing within 15 days of service of the Director's Order. If a respondent fails to appeal the Director's Order within 15 days of service, the Director's Order shall be final. If the last day of the appeal period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the appeal period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day.

### 14.19.090 - Appeal procedure and failure to appear

1. Contested hearings shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures for hearing contested cases contained in Section 3.02.090 and the rules adopted by the Hearing Examiner for hearing contested cases. The review shall be conducted de novo and the Director shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation or violations occurred. Upon establishing such proof, the remedies and penalties imposed by the Director shall be upheld unless it is shown that the Director abused discretion. Failure to appear for a contested hearing shall result in an order being entered finding that the respondent committed the violation stated in the Director's Order. For good cause shown and upon terms the Hearing Examiner deems just, the Hearing Examiner may set aside an order entered upon a failure to appear.
2. In all contested cases, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order affirming, modifying or reversing the Director's Order.

### 14.19.095 - Appeal from Hearing Examiner's order

1. The respondent may obtain judicial review of the decision of the Hearing Examiner by applying for a Writ of Review in the King County Superior Court within 30 days from the date of the decision in accordance with the procedure set forth in chapter 7.16 RCW, other applicable law, and court rules.
2. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final and conclusive unless review is sought in compliance with this Section 14.19.095.

### 14.19.100 - Failure to comply with final order

1. If a respondent fails to comply within 30 days of service of any settlement agreement with the Agency, or with any final order issued by the Director or the Hearing Examiner for which all appeal rights have been exhausted, the Agency may pursue, but is not limited to, the following measures to secure compliance:

    1. The Director may require the respondent to post public notice of the respondent's failure to comply in a form and manner determined by the Agency.
    2. The Director may refer the matter to a collection agency. The cost to the City for the collection services will be assessed as costs, at the rate agreed to between the City and the collection agency, and added to the amounts due.
    3. The Director may refer the matter to the City Attorney for the filing of a civil action in King County Superior Court, the Seattle Municipal Court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such order or to collect amounts due. In the alternative, the Director may seek to enforce a Director's Order or a final order of the Hearing Examiner under Section 14.19.105.
    4. The Director may request that the City's Department of Finance and Administrative Services deny, suspend, refuse to renew, or revoke any business license held or requested by the employer or person until such time as the employer complies with the remedy as defined in the settlement agreement or final order. The City's Department of Finance and Administrative Services shall have the authority to deny, refuse to renew, or revoke any business license in accordance with this subsection 14.19.100.A.4.
2. No respondent that is the subject of a final order issued under this Chapter 14.19 shall quit business, sell out, exchange, convey, or otherwise dispose of the respondent's business or stock of goods without first notifying the Agency and without first notifying the respondent's successor of the amounts owed under the final order at least three business days prior to such transaction. At the time the respondent quits business, or sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of the respondent's business or stock of goods, the full amount of the remedy, as defined in a final order issued by the Director or the Hearing Examiner, shall become immediately due and payable. If the amount due under the final order is not paid by respondent within ten days from the date of such sale, exchange, conveyance, or disposal, the successor shall become liable for the payment of the amount due, provided that the successor has actual knowledge of the order and the amounts due or has prompt, reasonable, and effective means of accessing and verifying the fact and amount of the order and the amounts due. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay the amount of the full remedy. When the successor makes such payment, that payment shall be deemed a payment upon the purchase price in the amount paid, and if such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price the amount of the difference shall become a debt due such successor from the employer.

### 14.19.105 - Debt owed The City of Seattle

1. All monetary amounts due under the Director's Order shall be a debt owed to the City and may be collected in the same manner as any other debt in like amount, which remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies, provided that amounts collected by the City for unpaid wages, liquidated damages, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, or front pay shall be held in trust by the City for the aggrieved party and, once collected by the City, shall be paid by the City to the aggrieved party.
2. If a respondent fails to appeal a Director's Order to the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.19.085.B, the Director's Order shall be final, and the Director may petition the Seattle Municipal Court to enforce the Director's Order by entering judgment in favor of the City finding that the respondent has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and that all amounts and relief contained in the order are due. The Director's Order shall constitute prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 containing evidence that the respondent has failed to comply with the order or any parts thereof, and is therefore in default, or that the respondent has failed to appeal the Director's Order to the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.19.085.B, and therefore has failed to exhaust the respondent's administrative remedies, shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation.
3. If a respondent fails to obtain judicial review of an order of the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.19.095.A, the order of the Hearing Examiner shall be final, and the Director may petition the Seattle Municipal Court to enforce the Director's Order by entering judgment in favor of the City for all amounts and relief due under the order of the Hearing Examiner. The order of the Hearing Examiner shall constitute conclusive evidence that the violations contained therein occurred and shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 containing evidence that the respondent has failed to comply with the order or any parts thereof, and is therefore in default, or that the respondent has failed to avail itself of judicial review in accordance with subsection 14.19.095.A shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation.
4. In considering matters brought under subsections 14.19.105.B and 14.19.105.C, the Municipal Court may include within its judgment all terms, conditions, and remedies contained in the Director's Order or the order of the Hearing Examiner, whichever is applicable, that are consistent with the provisions of this Chapter 14.19.

### 14.19.110 - Private right of action

1. Effective April 1, 2016, for claims against employers that employ 50 or more employees and effective April 1, 2017 for claims against employers that employ fewer than 50 employees, any person or class of persons that suffers financial injury as a result of a violation of this Chapter 14.19 or is the subject of prohibited retaliation under Section 14.19.055, may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the employer or other person violating this Chapter 14.19 and, upon prevailing, may be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs and such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to remedy the violation including, without limitation, the payment of any unpaid wages plus interest due to the person and liquidated damages in an additional amount of up to twice the unpaid wages; and a penalty payable to any aggrieved party of up to $5000 if the aggrieved party was subject to prohibited retaliation. Interest shall accrue from the date the unpaid wages were first due at 12 percent per annum, or the maximum rate permitted under RCW 19.52.020.
2. For purposes of determining employer size for this Section 14.19.110,

    1. An employee who is not covered by this Chapter 14.19 shall be included in any determination of the size of the employer.
    2. Employer size for the current calendar year will be calculated based upon the average number of employees who worked for compensation per calendar week during the preceding calendar year for any and all weeks during which at least one employee worked for compensation. For employers that did not have any employees during the previous calendar year, the employer schedule will be calculated based upon the average number of employees who worked for compensation per calendar week during the first 90 calendar days of the current year in which the employer engaged in business.
    3. All employees who worked for compensation shall be counted, including but not limited to:

        1. Employees who worked inside the City;
        2. Employees who worked outside the City; and
        3. Employees who worked in full-time employment, part-time employment, joint employment, temporary employment, or through the services of a temporary services or staffing agency or similar entity.
    4. Separate entities that form an integrated enterprise shall be considered a single employer under this Chapter 14.19. Separate entities will be considered an integrated enterprise and a single employer under this Chapter 14.19 where a separate entity controls the operation of another entity. The factors to consider in making this assessment include, but are not limited to:

        1. Degree of interrelation between the operations of multiple entities;

Such rights include but are not limited to the right to make inquiries about the rights protected under this Chapter 14.20; the right to inform others about their rights under this Chapter 14.20; the right to inform the person's employer, union, or similar organization, and/or the person's legal counsel or any other person about an alleged violation of this Chapter 14.20; the right to file an oral or written complaint with the Agency or bring a civil action for an alleged violation of this Chapter 14.20; the right to cooperate with the Agency in its investigations of this Chapter 14.20; the right to testify in a proceeding under or related to this Chapter 14.20; the right to refuse to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of city, state or federal law; and the right to oppose any policy, practice, or act that is unlawful under this Chapter 14.20.
3. No employer or any other person shall communicate to a person exercising rights protected under this Section 14.20.035, directly or indirectly the willingness to inform a government employee that the person is not lawfully in the United States, or to report, or to make an implied or express assertion of a willingness to report, suspected citizenship or immigration status of an employee or a family member of the employee to a federal, state, or local agency because the employee has exercised a right under this Chapter 14.20.
4. It shall be considered a rebuttable presumption of retaliation if an employer or any other person takes an adverse action against a person within 90 days of the person's exercise of rights protected in this Section 14.20.035. However, in the case of seasonal work that ended before the close of the 90 day period, the presumption also applies if the employer fails to rehire a former employee at the next opportunity for work in the same position. The employer may rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the adverse action was taken for a permissible purpose.
5. Standard of proof. Proof of retaliation under this Section 14.20.035 shall be sufficient upon a showing that an employer or any other person has taken an adverse action against a person and the person's exercise of rights protected in Section 14.20.035 was a motivating factor in the adverse action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such protected activity.
6. The protections afforded under this Section 14.20.035 shall apply to any person who mistakenly but in good faith alleges violations of this Chapter 14.20.
7. A complaint or other communication by any person triggers the protections of this Section 14.20.035 regardless of whether the complaint or communication is in writing or makes explicit reference to this Chapter 14.20.

### 14.20.045 - Violation

The failure of any respondent to comply with any requirement imposed on the respondent under this Chapter 14.20 is a violation.


### 14.20.050 - Investigation

1. The Agency shall have the power to investigate any violations of this Chapter 14.20 by any respondent. The Agency may initiate an investigation pursuant to rules issued by the Director including, but not limited to, situations when the Director has reason to believe that a violation has occurred or will occur, or when circumstances show that violations are likely to occur within a class of businesses because the workforce contains significant numbers of workers who are vulnerable to violations of this Chapter 14.20 or the workforce is unlikely to volunteer information regarding such violations. An investigation may also be initiated through the receipt by the Agency of a report or complaint filed by an employee or any other person.
2. An employee or other person may report to the Agency any suspected violation of this Chapter 14.20. The Agency shall encourage reporting pursuant to this Section 14.20.050 by taking the following measures:

    1. The Agency shall keep confidential, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, the name and other identifying information of the employee or person reporting the violation. However, with the authorization of such person, the Agency may disclose the employee's or person's name and identifying information as necessary to enforce this Chapter 14.20 or for other appropriate purposes.
    2. An employer must post or otherwise notify its employees that the Agency is conducting an investigation, using a form provided by the Agency and displaying it on-site, in a conspicuous and accessible location, and in English and the primary language spoken by the employee(s) at the particular workplace. If display of the form is not feasible, including situations when the employee works remotely or does not have a regular workplace, employers may provide the form on an individual basis in physical or electronic format that is reasonably conspicuous and accessible.
    3. The Agency may certify the eligibility of eligible persons for "U" Visas under the provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1184.p and 8 U.S.C. § 1101.a.15.U. This certification is subject to applicable federal law and regulations, and rules issued by the Director.
3. The Agency's investigation must commence within three years of the alleged violation. To the extent permitted by law, the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions is tolled during any investigation under this Chapter 14.20 and any administrative enforcement proceeding under this Chapter 14.20 based upon the same facts. For purposes of this Chapter 14.20:

    1. The Agency's investigation begins on the earlier date of when the Agency receives a complaint from a person under this Chapter 14.20, or the Agency opens an investigation under this Chapter 14.20.
    2. The Agency's investigation ends when the Agency issues a final order concluding the matter and any appeals have been exhausted; the time to file any appeal has expired; or the Agency notifies the respondent in writing that the investigation has been otherwise resolved.
4. The Agency's investigation shall be conducted in an objective and impartial manner.
5. The Director may apply by affidavit or declaration in the form allowed under RCW 9A.72.085 to the Hearing Examiner for the issuance of subpoenas requiring an employer to produce the records identified in subsection 14.20.030.A, or for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or for the production of documents required to be retained under subsection 14.20.030.A, or any other document relevant to the issue of whether any employee or group of employees has been or is afforded proper amounts of compensation under this Chapter 14.20 and/or to whether an employer has violated any provision of this Chapter 14.20. The Hearing Examiner shall conduct the review without hearing as soon as practicable and shall issue subpoenas upon a showing that there is reason to believe that a violation has occurred if a complaint has been filed with the Agency, or that circumstances show that violations are likely to occur within a class of businesses because the workforce contains significant numbers of workers who are vulnerable to violations of this Chapter 14.20 or the workforce is unlikely to volunteer information regarding such violations.
6. An employer that fails to comply with the terms of any subpoena issued under subsection 14.20.050. E. in an investigation by the Agency under this Chapter 14.20 prior to the issuance of a Director's Order issued pursuant to subsection 14.20.055.C may not use such records in any appeal to challenge the correctness of any determination by the Agency of damages owed or penalties assessed.
7. In addition to other remedies, the Director may refer any subpoena issued under subsection 14.20.050.E, to the City Attorney to seek a court order to enforce any subpoena.
8. Where the Director has reason to believe that a violation has occurred, the Director may order any appropriate temporary or interim relief to mitigate the violation or maintain the status quo pending completion of a full investigation or hearing, including but not limited to a deposit of funds or bond sufficient to satisfy a good-faith estimate of compensation, interest, damages and penalties due. A respondent may appeal any such order in accordance with subsection 14.20.065.B.

### 14.20.055 - Findings of fact and determination

The Director's Order shall state with specificity the amounts due under this Chapter 14.20 for each violation, including payment of unpaid compensation, liquidated damages, civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, fines, and interest pursuant to Section 14.20.060. The Director's Order may specify that civil penalties and fines due to the Agency can be mitigated for respondent's timely payment of remedy due to an aggrieved party under subsection 14.20.060.A.2. The Director's Order may direct the respondent to take such corrective action as is necessary to comply with the requirements of this Chapter 14.20, including, but not limited to, monitored compliance for a reasonable time period. The Director's Order shall include notice of the respondent's right to appeal the decision, pursuant to subsection 14.20.065.B.
4. If the Director has a reasonable belief that a notice of violation for this Chapter 14.20 also indicates a violation of Section 12A.08.060, the Director may refer the complaint to the Seattle Police Department for further investigation or to the City Attorney's Office for prosecution.

### 14.20.060 - Remedies

The fine amounts shall be increased cumulatively by 50 percent of the fine for each preceding violation for each subsequent violation of the same provision by the same employer or person within a ten year period. The maximum amount that may be imposed in fines in any one year period for each type of violation listed above is $5,000 unless a fine for retaliation is issued, in which case the maximum amount is $20,000.


1. The payment of unpaid compensation, liquidated damages, civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, fines, and interest provided under this Chapter 14.20 are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of any other available remedies, penalties, fines, and procedures.

The Agency shall determine the amounts and file a schedule of such amounts with the City Clerk.
    2. If there is a remedy due to an aggrieved party, the Director may waive the total amount of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency if the Director determines that the respondent paid the full remedy due to the aggrieved party within ten days of service of the Director's Order. The Director may waive half the amount of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency if the Director determines that the respondent paid the full remedy due to the aggrieved party within 15 days of service of the Director's Order. The Director shall not waive any amount of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency if the Director determines that the respondent has not paid the full remedy due to the aggrieved party after 15 days of service of the Director's Order.
    3. When determining the amount of liquidated damages, civil penalties, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, and fines due under this Section 14.20.060, for a Settlement Agreement or Director's Order, including but not limited to the mitigation of civil penalties and fines due to the Agency for timely payment of remedy due to an aggrieved party under subsection 14.20.060.A.2, the Director shall consider the total amount of unpaid compensation, liquidated damages, penalties, fines, and interest due; the nature and persistence of the violations; the extent of the respondent's culpability, the substantive or technical nature of the violations; the size, revenue, and human resources capacity of the respondent; the circumstances of each situation; the amounts of penalties in similar situations; and other factors pursuant to rules issued by the Director.
2. A respondent found to be in violation of this Chapter 14.20 shall be liable for full payment of unpaid compensation plus interest in favor of the aggrieved party under the terms of this Chapter 14.20, and other equitable relief. For a first violation of this Chapter 14.20, the Director may assess liquidated damages in an additional amount of up to twice the unpaid compensation. For subsequent violations of this Chapter 14.20, the Director shall assess an amount of liquidated damages in an additional amount of twice the unpaid compensation. If the violation is ongoing when the Agency receives a complaint or opens an investigation, the Director may order payment of amounts that accrue after receipt of the complaint or after the investigation opens and before the date of the Director's Order. Interest shall accrue from the date the unpaid compensation were first due at 12 percent per annum, or the maximum rate permitted under RCW 19.52.020. For purposes of establishing a first and subsequent violation for this Section 14.20.060, the violation must have occurred within ten years of the Director's Order.
3. A respondent found to be in violation of this Chapter 14.20 for retaliation under Section 14.20.060 shall be subject to any appropriate relief at law or equity including, but not limited to reinstatement of the aggrieved party, front pay in lieu of reinstatement with full payment of unpaid compensation plus interest in favor of the aggrieved party under the terms of this Chapter 14.20, and liquidated damages in an additional amount of up to twice the unpaid compensation. The Director also shall order the imposition of a penalty payable to the aggrieved party of up to $5,000.

5. A respondent who willfully hinders, prevents, impedes, or interferes with the Director or Hearing Examiner in the performance of their duties under this Chapter 14.20 shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000.
6. For a first violation of this Chapter 14.20, the Director may assess a civil penalty of up to $500 per aggrieved party. For a second violation of this Chapter 14.20, the Director shall assess a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per aggrieved party, or an amount equal to ten percent of the total amount of unpaid compensation, whichever is greater. For a third or any subsequent violation of this Chapter 14.20, the Director shall assess a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per aggrieved party, or an amount equal to ten percent of the total amount of unpaid compensation, whichever is greater. The maximum civil penalty for a violation of this Chapter 14.20 shall be $20,000 per aggrieved party, or an amount equal to ten percent of the total amount of unpaid compensation, whichever is greater. For purposes of this Section 14.20.060, a violation is a second, third, or subsequent violation if the respondent has been a party to one, two or more than two Settlement Agreements, respectively, stipulating that a violation has occurred; and/or one, two, or more than two Director's Orders, respectively, have issued against the respondent in the ten years preceding the date of the violation; otherwise, it is a first violation.

8. In addition to the unpaid compensation, penalties, fines, liquidated damages, and interest, the Agency may assess against the respondent in favor of the City reasonable costs incurred in enforcing this Chapter 14.20, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees.
9. An employer that is the subject of a final order for which all appeal rights have been exhausted shall not be permitted to bid, or have a bid considered, on any City contract until such amounts due under the final order have been paid in full to the Director. If an employer is the subject of a final order two times or more within a five-year period, the contractor or subcontractor shall not be allowed to bid on any City contract for two years. This subsection 14.20.060.I. shall be construed to provide grounds for debarment separate from, and in addition to, those contained in Chapter 20.70 and shall not be governed by that chapter provided that nothing in this subsection 14.16.080.I shall be construed to limit the application of Chapter 20.70. The Director shall notify the Director of Finance and Administrative Services of all employers subject to debarment under this subsection 14.20.060.I.

If the last day of the appeal period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the appeal period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day.

### 14.20.070 - Appeal procedure and failure to appear

1. Contested hearings shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures for hearing contested cases contained in Section 3.02.090 and the rules adopted by the Hearing Examiner for hearing contested cases. The review shall be conducted de novo and the Director shall have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence before the Hearing Examiner. Upon establishing such proof, the remedies and penalties imposed by the Director shall be upheld unless it is shown that the Director abused discretion. Failure to appear for a contested hearing will result in an order being entered finding that the employer committed the violation stated in the Director's order. For good cause shown and upon terms the Hearing Examiner deems just, the Hearing Examiner may set aside an order entered upon a failure to appear.
2. In all contested cases, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order affirming, modifying or reversing the Director's order.

### 14.20.075 - Appeal from Hearing Examiner order

1. The respondent may obtain judicial review of the decision of the Hearing Examiner by applying for a Writ of Review in the King County Superior Court within 30 days from the date of the decision in accordance with the procedure set forth in Chapter 7.16 RCW, other applicable law, and court rules.
2. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final and conclusive unless review is sought in compliance with this Section 14.20.075.

### 14.20.080 - Failure to comply with final order

1. If a respondent fails to comply within 30 days of service of any settlement agreement with the Agency, or with any final order issued by the Director or the Hearing Examiner for which all appeal rights have been exhausted, the Agency may pursue, but is not limited to, the following measures to secure compliance:

    1. The Director may require the respondent to post public notice of the respondent's failure to comply in a form and manner determined by the Agency.
    2. The Director may refer the matter to a collection agency. The cost to the City for the collection services will be assessed as costs, at the rate agreed to between the City and the collection agency, and added to the amounts due.
    3. The Director may refer the matter to the City Attorney for the filing of a civil action in King County Superior Court, the Seattle Municipal Court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction to enforce such order or to collect amounts due. In the alternative, the Director may seek to enforce a Director's Order or a final order of the Hearing Examiner under Section 14.20.085.
    4. The Director may request that the City's Department of Finance and Administrative Services deny, suspend, refuse to renew, or revoke any business license held or requested by the employer or person until such time as the employer complies with the remedy as defined in the settlement agreement or final order. The City's Department of Finance and Administrative Services shall have the authority to deny, refuse to renew, or revoke any business license in accordance with this subsection 14.20.080.A.4.
2. No respondent that is the subject of a final order issued under this Chapter 14.20 shall quit business, sell out, exchange, convey, or otherwise dispose of the respondent's business or stock of goods without first notifying the Agency and without first notifying the respondent's successor of the amounts owed under the final order at least three business days prior to such transaction. At the time the respondent quits business, or sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of the respondent's business or stock of goods, the full amount of the remedy, as defined in a final order issued by the Director or the Hearing Examiner, shall become immediately due and payable. If the amount due under the final order is not paid by respondent within ten days from the date of such sale, exchange, conveyance, or disposal, the successor shall become liable for the payment of the amount due, provided that the successor has actual knowledge of the order and the amounts due or has prompt, reasonable, and effective means of accessing and verifying the fact and amount of the order and the amounts due. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay the amount of the full remedy. When the successor makes such payment, that payment shall be deemed a payment upon the purchase price in the amount paid, and if such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price the amount of the difference shall become a debt due such successor from the employer.

### 14.20.085 - Debt owed The City of Seattle

1. All monetary amounts due under the Director's Order shall be a debt owed to the City and may be collected in the same manner as any other debt in like amount, which remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies, provided that amounts collected by the City for unpaid compensation, liquidated damages, penalties payable to aggrieved parties, or front pay shall be held in trust by the City for the aggrieved party and, once collected by the City, shall be paid by the City to the aggrieved party.
2. If a respondent fails to appeal a Director's Order to the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.20.065.B the Director's Order shall be final, and the Director may petition the Seattle Municipal Court to enforce the Director's Order by entering judgment in favor of the City finding that the respondent has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and that all amounts and relief contained in the order are due. The Director's Order shall constitute prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 containing evidence that the respondent has failed to comply with the order or any parts thereof, and is therefore in default, or that the respondent has failed to appeal the Director's Order to the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.20.065.B and therefore has failed to exhaust the respondent's administrative remedies, shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation.
3. If a respondent fails to obtain judicial review of an order of the Hearing Examiner within the time period set forth in subsection 14.20.075.A, the order of the Hearing Examiner shall be final, and the Director may petition the Seattle Municipal Court to enforce the Director's Order by entering judgment in favor of the City for all amounts and relief due under the order of the Hearing Examiner. The order of the Hearing Examiner shall constitute conclusive evidence that the violations contained therein occurred and shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 containing evidence that the respondent has failed to comply with the order or any parts thereof, and is therefore in default, or that the respondent has failed to avail itself of judicial review in accordance with subsection 14.20.075.A, shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation.
4. In considering matters brought under subsections 14.20.085.B and 14.20.085.C, the Municipal Court may include within its judgment all terms, conditions, and remedies contained in the Director's Order or the order of the Hearing Examiner, whichever is applicable, that are consistent with the provisions of this Chapter 14.20.

### 14.20.090 - Private right of action

1. Effective April 1, 2016, for claims against employers that employ 50 or more employees and effective April 1, 2017 for claims against employers that employ fewer than 50 employees, any person or class of persons that suffers financial injury as a result of a violation of this Chapter 14.20 or is the subject of prohibited retaliation under Section 14.20.035, may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the employer or other person violating this Chapter 14.20 and, upon prevailing, may be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs and such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to remedy the violation including, without limitation, the payment of any unpaid compensation plus interest due to the person and liquidated damages in an additional amount of up to twice the unpaid compensation; a penalty payable to any aggrieved party of up to $5,000 if the aggrieved party was subject to prohibited retaliation. Interest shall accrue from the date the unpaid compensation were first due at 12 percent per annum, or the maximum rate permitted under RCW 19.52.020.
2. For purposes of determining employer size for this Section 14.20.090,

    1. An employee who is not covered by this Chapter 14.20 shall be included in any determination of employer size.
    2. Employer size for the current calendar year will be calculated based upon the average number per calendar week of employees who worked for compensation during the preceding calendar year for any and all weeks during which at least one employee worked for compensation. For employers that did not have any employees during the previous calendar year, the employer size will be calculated based upon the average number per calendar week of employees who worked for compensation during the first 90 calendar days of the current year in which the employer engaged in business.
    3. All employees who worked for compensation shall be counted, including but not limited to:

        1. Employees who worked inside the City;
        2. Employees who worked outside the City; and
        3. Employees who worked in full-time employment, part-time employment, joint employment, temporary employment, or through the services of a temporary services or staffing agency or similar entity.
    4. Separate entities that form an integrated enterprise shall be considered a single employer under this Chapter 14.20. Separate entities will be considered an integrated enterprise and a single employer under this Chapter 14.20 where a separate entity controls the operation of another entity. The factors to consider in making this assessment include, but are not limited to:

        1. Degree of interrelation between the operations of multiple entities;
        2. Degree to which the entities share common management;
        3. Centralized control of labor relations; and
        4. Degree of common ownership or financial control over the entities.
3. For purposes of this Section 14.20.090, "person" includes any entity a member of which has suffered financial injury or retaliation, or any other individual or entity acting on behalf of an aggrieved party that has suffered financial injury or retaliation.
4. For purposes of determining membership within a class of persons entitled to bring an action under this Section 14.20.090, two or more employees are similarly situated if they:

    1. Are or were employed by the same employer or employers, whether concurrently or otherwise, at some point during the applicable statute of limitations period,
    2. Allege one or more violations that raise similar questions as to liability, and
    3. Seek similar forms of relief.
5. For purposes of subsection 14.20.090.D, employees shall not be considered dissimilar solely because their

    1. Claims seek damages that differ in amount, or
    2. Job titles or other means of classifying employees differ in ways that are unrelated to their claims.

### 14.20.095 - Other legal requirements

This Chapter 14.20 defines requirements for compensation owed by reason of employment to employees performing work within City limits and shall not be construed to preempt, limit, or otherwise affect the applicability of any other law, regulation, requirement, policy, or standard that provides for greater requirements; and nothing in this Chapter 14.20 shall be interpreted or applied so as to create any power or duty in conflict with federal or state law. Nor shall this Chapter 14.20 be construed to preclude any person aggrieved from seeking judicial review of any final administrative decision or order made under this Chapter 14.20 affecting such person.


### 14.20.100 - Severability
