The cost of such relocation or readjustment shall be charged against the property at which the erection of the permanent structure, as hereinabove referred to, is to be or has been done, and to the owner thereof. In no case shall the City be required to maintain or repair any portion of the service connection between the union and property line.
2. In case of application for water service to supply premises not abutting upon a street in which there is a standard City water main, the Director will require construction of a standard water main abutting the property before a connection is made; provided that, under certain conditions, a temporary connection may be provided for the property, or a service to the property of the applicant may be placed along and beneath any public street or avenue.

#### 21.04.080 - Separate service connections for each house—Exceptions.

Where there is a water main in front of any premises, the owner of each house supplied by City water must install his own separate service connection with the City main, and the premises so supplied will not be allowed to supply water to any other premises, except temporarily where there are no mains in the street, provided that such restrictions shall not apply to services already installed unless in the judgment of the Director it is found necessary to enforce such provisions as to connections already made. Provided, further, where two (2) or more buildings are supplied by one (1) metered service, not less than the minimum rate for premises supplied by meters, hereinafter provided for, shall be assessed for each separate building or premises so supplied.


#### 21.04.090 - Connection—Pipe materials and covering—Sprinkler systems.

1. Anyone connecting to City water service pipes or laying their own private pipe, shall use only standard galvanized wrought iron, galvanized steel, or copper pipe up to and including two (2) inches in size, and all pipes shall be laid with not less than two (2) feet of earth cover over the top of such pipe, exclusive of any pavement or other improvement laid on the earth cover, except as hereinafter provided. The Director will maintain private services from City mains in streets which are being graded and will have such access on private property as shall be necessary to maintain such pipes during the work, and shall as soon as practicable upon the completion of such work, re-lay the pipes in street. Except for above cause, owners shall maintain their private pipes from the end of the City service to and into their property, or in case the Director finds it necessary to maintain same the owner shall relinquish all right in the pipes. When necessary the Director may slope service in on property to conform to the slope occasioned by the grading of street and charge expense to owner of service.
2. Whenever pipes connecting with a City service connection are to be used as part of a lawn and shrubbery sprinkling system exclusively such pipes may, at the option of the property owner, be laid with less than two (2) feet of earth cover. The property owner shall be required to install a control valve on each branch pipe which may lead from regular domestic supply pipes to the lawn and shrubbery sprinkling system.
3. Such lawn sprinkler systems may be constructed of nonmetallic material beyond an approved vacuum-breaker located on the discharge side of the last control valve; subject, however, to all provisions of the Plumbing Code (Ordinance No. 80242).
4. Sprinkling systems of this nature shall be constructed in such manner that all pipes and fittings connected therewith can be thoroughly drained when their seasonable use has been discontinued.

#### 21.04.100 - Connection—Minimum size—Fees and charges.

1. No service connection less than three-fourths inch (¾″) in size shall be installed.
2. The fees for the installation of water service as hereinbefore provided shall be the actual cost of labor and material plus overhead charges to be determined by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities in laying such a service and replacing the pavement.
3. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities may establish standard charges based on a review of prevailing actual costs for the installation of the various sizes of service. Such standard charges shall be subject to annual review.

#### 21.04.105 - Connection Charge.

1. In addition to water service installation fees and charges required by ordinance or administrative rule, the owner of a property seeking either for the first time to connect that property to the water distribution system for any water purposes, or to expand existing water service shall pay a Connection Charge prior to connection.
2. A property may be exempt from paying the Connection Charge in circumstances where an equivalent contribution is made at the time the owner of the property is seeking to connect or reconnect to the water system, such as the construction of a water main accepted by Seattle Public Utilities as part of its distribution system. Any such exemptions for equivalent contributions shall be defined in Seattle Public Utilities Policy and Procedure, which may be amended from time to time by the Director.
3. The collection of a Connection Charge to serve a single family residence may be deferred with interest at the request of an owner who meets both of the following criteria: (1) is economically disadvantaged, as defined in Section 20.12.020 B of the Seattle Municipal Code; and (2) also owns and occupies the residence which will be connected to the water distribution system. Interest on the principal will be calculated at the rate of 150 basis points (1.5%) added to the yield for 10-year U.S. Treasury Constant Securities (e.g., if the yield is 5.02%, the interest charge would be 6.52%). The interest rate shall be fixed for the duration of contract, using the Treasury yield for the most current month listed on the Federal Reserve's internet website,www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm#fn113, or successor website, or other source. The rate will be determined at the time the finance contract is signed by the property owner. Such contract shall provide that any unpaid balance may be paid off in full at any time. All charges, including interest so deferred, shall become a lien against the property and shall be recorded by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities in the office of the County Recorder at the expense of the property owner, and such deferred payment shall be due and payable in full at the time of sale or transfer of the property or at the time the property ceases to be used as a single family residence.

#### 21.04.115 - Payment of Connection Charge.

The Connection Charge shall be paid either in cash, or under an installment contract. An installment contract shall provide for a down payment of a minimum of one-fortieth () of the total Connection Charge, payable upon execution of such contract and for payment of the balance in equal installments of the unpaid balance payable at specified intervals throughout the term of the contract, together with interest as provided in this section. Interest on the principal will be calculated at the rate of 150 basis points (1.5%) added to the yield for 10-year U.S. Treasury Constant Securities (e.g., if the yield is 5.02%, the interest charge would be 6.52%). The interest rate shall be fixed for the duration of contract, using the Treasury yield for the most current month listed on the Federal Reserve's internet website,www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm#fn113, or successor website, or other source. The rate will be determined at the time the finance contract is signed by the property owner. Such installment contract shall be no more than ten years in duration and shall provide that any unpaid balance may be paid off in full at any time. Such contract shall include a provision that in the event of failure to pay the required installments, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities may disconnect the City's water service from and refuse to supply water to the premises until the unpaid installments are paid. In addition, the installment contract shall become a lien against the property and shall be recorded by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities in the office of the County Recorder at the expense of the property owner, and such deferred payment shall be due and payable in full at the time of sale or transfer of the property.


#### 21.04.125 - Calculation of the Connection Charge.

The Connection Charge shall be calculated as the product of Connection Charge Units (CCU) and Connection Charge Unit Rate (CCUR). The CCU is a measure of the size of the new water service connection or connections or the increase in the size of an existing connection or connections. The CCU is the aggregation of the new retail service connections being requested by the owner (or the requested connections for existing services) weighted by their hydraulic capacities and expressed as a multiple of a single ¾-inch domestic service connection. The CCUR represents the equity value of the water system, as represented by the total asset value of the system less the value of outstanding bonds as detailed in the Water Fund's annual financial statement, attributable to a single customer with a ¾-inch service. Measurement of the CCU and administration of the Connection Charge will conform to adopted Departmental Policy and Procedure.


#### 21.04.150 - Unused connections.

On all water service connections unused for a period fifteen (15) years, or more, from date of installation, the City reserves the right: (A) to consider the same obsolete and remove the service, at the City's option; or (B) to require payment for a new service.


#### 21.04.160 - Stop and waste cocks—Inspection of water pipes.

1. Before water will be turned on to any premises connected with the City's mains, the service pipes upon such premises must be made to conform to the following regulations: The service pipes must be so located that the supply for each separate house or premises shall be controlled by separate stop and waste cocks of the best standard make, approved by the Director, with extension handle, properly protected from the frost, and so placed within the premises that all service pipes and fixtures may be thoroughly drained during freezing weather. Where sags or depressions occur in the pipe and this stop and waste cock is not sufficient to fully drain all the pipes and fixtures within the premises, additional stop and waste cocks, with extension handles, or other approved vents must be so placed as to fully drain them. In cases where no fixtures are placed between the property line and the basement the stop and waste cock may be placed in the basement, provided the basement is not less than six feet (6') in height and is provided with stairways or other means of access thereto; provided further, that where basements are enclosed in wooden walls the stop and waste cock shall be placed at least twelve inches (12") below the surface of the ground, and shall be provided with an extension handle. Stop and waste cocks on premises fronting on ungraded streets shall be placed at least six feet (6') inside of property line of the premises. The connection between the City's pipes at the property line and the service pipes on the premises must be made with a union. Every existing service or branch service not already equipped as required in this section must be so equipped at the owner's expense as soon as the defect is noted.
2. All water pipes which shall hereafter be laid, relaid or repaired on any private premises or in any street or public place within the City, shall be subject to inspection by the Director, before such water pipes are covered.

#### 21.04.170 - Request to turn on water.

Whenever the owner of any premises connected with the City's water supply system shall desire to use the water he shall notify the Director and request that the water be turned on to the premises. The owner shall leave his portion of the service exposed in the trench until the water is turned on by the Director, when he shall immediately properly cover the pipe.


#### 21.04.180 - Supplying water to additional premises—Application.

It shall be unlawful for any person whose premises are supplied with water to furnish water to additional premises unless he shall first make application in writing so to do at the office of the Director.


#### 21.04.190 - Supplying water to additional premises—Charges.

When additional premises are connected without the application prescribed in Section 21.04.180, such premises may be charged at double the rate for the time they are in use, and the service may be shut off by the Director and the current standard charges made for shutting off and turning on such service. In case water shall be turned off as provided in this section, the same shall not be turned on again until all rates and charges against the premises have been paid in full.


#### 21.04.200 - New connections on old sites—Abandoned connections—Transfers to new water mains.

When new buildings are to be erected on the site of the old ones and it is desired to increase the size or change the location of the old service connection, or where a service connection to any premises is abandoned or no longer used, the Director may cut out or remove such service connection, after which, should a service connection be required to the premises, a new service shall be placed only upon the owner making an application and paying for a new tap in the regular manner. When service connection of any premises on an unpaved street does not exceed one inch (1") in size and the same does not come from the main in front of the premises the Director shall, when a main is laid in front of the premises, after notifying the owner or tenant thereof, transfer the service connection to the new main without charge, and at the same time cut out the old service connection. When a new main is laid in any street owners of premises on the street, or within one-half (½) block on side streets, who are being supplied with City water from a private main or a connection to a private service shall make application for tap and shall connect up with a separate service connection to the main in front of premises.


#### 21.04.210 - Discontinuance of service—Reinstallation application—Temporary service.

1. Whenever the owner of any premises connected with the City's water supply system desires to discontinue the use of water, he shall make written application to have the meter removed from the service. The actual cost of removing meter shall be charged to the property, except that the Director may establish standard charges based on a review of prevailing actual costs of removal of meters. The same rate shall apply for reinstatement.
2. When it is desired to have a meter reinstalled the owner of the premises to be supplied by such meter shall file an application at the office of the Director on forms provided for the purpose, and shall pay the cost in full for such reinstallation.
3. The Director shall cause the reinstallation of meters within twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt of application for same. In the event of emergency the Director may, at his discretion, permit the temporary use of unmetered water, such temporary use to be limited to the time of the placing of the meter on the service connection.
4. In all cases of the City furnishing temporary service within the meaning of this section a charge to be determined by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities based on the actual cost of furnishing the temporary service shall be added to and made a part of the regular meter charges.

#### 21.04.230 - Reconnections—Procedure.

When a meter has been removed from any premises upon the application of the owner thereof, or for nonpayment of water charges, or for any other cause, it shall be unlawful for any person again to connect such premises with water until all arrearages for the premises have been paid, and application made for reinstallation of meter, and other cause or causes corrected to the satisfaction of the Director.


#### 21.04.240 - Water shut off by City.

When water has been shut off by the City for any cause, and is turned on again or allowed or caused to be turned on by the owner, no remission of rates will be made on account of its having been shut off, and the Director may then shut off the water at the main, or remove a portion of the service connection in the street and shall charge the actual cost of cutting out and reinstating the water supply.


#### 21.04.250 - Charges—Delinquency and lien.

All water rates will be charged against the premises for which the service was installed. All charges for water, when the same become delinquent and unpaid, shall be a lien against the premises to which water has been furnished. In case any charges for water shall become a lien against any premises, the water shall be cut off until such charges are paid.


#### 21.04.260 - Accounts to be in name of owner or leaseholder.

1. All accounts for water shall be kept only in the name of the owner of the premises for which service was installed, provided, however, that persons holding under recorded lease may be supplied on their own account, and in such cases the Director may require such deposit of money with the Director of Finance and Administrative Services of the City as in his or her judgment shall be necessary to protect the City against any and all delinquent and unpaid charges for water or other charges on account of such service. The property owner shall have the right to have water bills mailed to a tenant, or agent, but this shall not relieve the property from liability for water charges incurred.
2. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities may establish and collect charges based on actual costs, for special meter readings ordered in connection with property ownership or occupancy changes.

#### 21.04.270 - Water for construction purposes.

1. It shall be the duty of the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections to report to the Director of Seattle Public Utilities the beginning of construction or repairs of all buildings in the City, such reports to be a duplicate of the building permit issued, containing a general description of the building to be erected or repaired, the name of the owner and contractor thereof, the official house number and street name, and the lot, block, and addition.
2. Water for construction purposes will only be furnished upon the application of the owner or authorized agent of the property.
3. Water for construction purposes shall be furnished by meter, and charged to the premises supplied and the owner thereof.

#### 21.04.280 - Reserved.

1. The service pipes, connections and other apparatus within any private premises must be kept in good repair and protected from freezing, at the expense of the owner or lessee, who will be responsible for all damages resulting from leaks and breaks. In case of neglect to promptly repair any service or fixture, or make any changes or alterations required in this chapter, the Director shall have authority, when deemed necessary, to go on the premises and make or cause to be made such changes, alterations or repairs, and charge the same against the premises and the owner thereof.
2. The repairs of any meter damaged by hot water shall be charged to the owner of the property for which such meter was installed. The deformation or warping of a metered disc or a register figure disc of any meter shall be held to be prima facie evidence of such damage having been caused by the action of heat.

#### 21.04.320 - Wasting water and other unlawful uses.

It shall be unlawful for any person to wilfully allow water to be wasted by imperfect or leaking stops, valves, pipes, closets, faucets or other fixtures, or to use water closets without self-closing valves, or to use the water for purposes other than those named in the application upon which rates for water are based, or for any other purpose than that for which his contract provides.

In no case shall any tap be made upon any pipe used for fire service purposes, or any tank connected therewith, nor shall the use of any water be permitted through any fire service nor through any pipes, tank or other fixtures therewith connected for any purpose except the extinguishing of fire on the premises. Provided, however, that all fire protection services heretofore or hereafter installed by the City or by the state exclusively for fire-control purposes on Interstate Highways 5 and 90 are exempted from the provisions of this section requiring installation of meters on fire protection services; provided further that all water for such connections be used exclusively for fire-control purposes.
2. If in the event water is used for any other purpose than firefighting, through a fire service, after notice of a prior violation has been given by letter to the owner and/or occupant, and such service is not equipped with a device for accurately recording such flow of water, the Director shall install a detector meter on such service and charge all cost of such installation to the property.

1. Wholesale Customers—Commodity and Base Charges.

    1. Reserved
    2. Full or Partial Requirements Contracts. The rate to be charged to wholesale customers being served under the provisions of contracts substantially in the form of the Full and Partial Requirements Contracts for the Supply of Water that were authorized by Ordinance 120362 or 123559 ("Full or Partial Requirements Contract") shall consist of a commodity charge, surcharges, discounts and facilities charges as follows:
2. Wholesale Customers—Demand Charge. In addition to the foregoing, each municipal water district, other municipality, and nonprofit water association being served prior to January 1, 1970, shall be subject to a demand charge based on effective deficient water storage, as determined by the peak instantaneous flow rate, and the equivalent financing costs to provide storage. The proceeds from this demand charge, together with any interest earnings thereon, shall be deposited in the Water Fund. The amount of the proceeds shall be recorded in a separate account and shall be recognized in cost allocation studies as a credit to the total revenue to be recovered from wholesale customers through any wholesale rates on consumption in excess of base period amounts. Such demand charge and method of application thereof shall be as follows:

    1. The policy of the Seattle Public Utilities is to supply water to wholesale water purveyor customers (municipal water districts, other municipalities, and nonprofit water associations) at the twenty-four (24) hour average flow rate. Water purveyors are expected to provide or pay for storage for peaking rates above such average flow rate.
    2. A demand charge will be applicable to water purveyors who are found to have deficient storage as determined in the following paragraphs.
    3. The water services (master meters) to purveyors will be monitored by the Seattle Public Utilities to determine applicability of the demand charge. Demand metering equipment will be installed on master meters to purveyors at Seattle Public Utilities expense.
    4. Water services to a purveyor on a uniform segment of supply line may be considered as one (1) water service in calculating storage deficiency.
    5. A "day" for purposes of this schedule commences at nine (9:00) a.m. and ends at nine (9:00) a.m. the following calendar day.
    6. The demand factor for each water service is determined by dividing the fifteen (15) minute peak flow rate by the twenty-four (24) hour average flow rate of the same day.
    7. The ten (10) maximum flow days for each water service will be used to determine the average demand factor from which storage deficiency will be calculated. The average demand factor is the average of the demand factors of the ten (10) maximum flow days for each water service.
    8. A demand charge for each water service shall be applied only when the average demand factor exceeds 1.3.
    9. The deficient storage volume of each water service for demand charge calculation rate shall be S = 0.22(F-1)Q: where S = storage deficiency in gallons, F = average demand factor and Q = average daily quantity of water in gallons used in the ten (10) maximum flow days for each water service.
    10. As of January 1, 1999, the demand charge shall be calculated by applying a storage deficiency rate of Twenty-two Dollars ($22) per month per thousand gallons of deficient storage. The total purveyor demand charge shall be the sum of the demand charges for each water service.
    11. The demand charge will be calculated in the fall of each year based upon evaluation of the summer months (June, July and August) water delivery flow rates and upon the storage deficiency rate in effect at the time that those flows occurred. The monthly storage deficiency demand charge billing shall commence in January at which time a new charge, if any, shall be applied.
    12. Peak flow rates through master meters will be monitored during the summer months; however, if peak flow rates create adverse hydraulic conditions, demand metering may be applied year-round, after reasonable notice to purveyor customers.
    13. Purveyors may use other sources of supply approved by the Superintendent of Seattle Public Utilities such as interconnection with other purveyor's systems or wells for summer water supply peaking purposes.
    14. If purveyors formulate approved cooperative operating agreements, their services on uniform segments of supply line may be considered as one (1) service in determining demand charge.
    15. Peak flows caused by major accidents in a purveyor's water system will be excluded in determining the demand charge. Peak flows caused by other unusual situations may also be excluded at the discretion of the Superintendent of Seattle Public Utilities. Documentation of such incidents shall be provided by purveyors to the Superintendent of Seattle Public Utilities within thirty (30) days after an accident.
    16. Artificially created daily flow rates which differ substantially from customer's daily consumption may be disallowed in calculating the demand charge.
    17. Approved electrical sensing circuits (e.g., for telemetering) from City master meters may be made available to purveyors on a reimbursable-cost basis. Such circuits shall be installed and maintained by the City; there will be no need for purveyors' representatives to enter City chambers.
    18. The demand charge for a certain master meter(s) may be excused if lower pressure water (or gravity flow water) replaces City-pumped water (or higher flow water), provided that the peak flow rate through this service does not exceed the demand rate threshold which would occur without the replacement of water service flow.
    19. In case of malfunction of metering equipment, the Seattle Public Utilities shall estimate the charge, if any, from best available data.

#### 21.04.450 - Reserved

#### 21.04.460 - Separate meters on same service—Rounding off of rates.

1. In all cases where water is furnished for purposes other than manufactories, laundries and elevators on the same service, separate meters must be provided and the water consumer charged at schedule rates, and such consumers must pay for all service connections as provided in this chapter.
2. In computing meter rates as provided hereinbefore, results ending in One or Two Cents ($.01 or .02) will be counted "0"; results ending in Three ($.03), Four ($.04), Six ($.06) or Seven Cents ($.07) will be counted "5"; results ending in Eight ($.08) or Nine Cents ($.09) will be counted "10."

Measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and waste to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the standards prescribed by the most recent edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater" (edited by Lenore S. Clesceri et alia, published by American Waterworks Association et alia). Other standards, such as Washington State Department of Ecology's Analytical Methods for Petroleum Hydrocarbons and other USEPA test methods may also apply, depending on analytes and appropriate parameters, as determined by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities. In or on any property served by a side sewer carrying industrial wastes, the owner, occupant, or operator shall install a manhole in the side sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes, when required by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities. Such manhole shall be accessible, safely located, and shall be constructed and installed in accordance with plans approved by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities. Such manhole shall be installed on the owner's property and shall be installed and maintained by the owner, occupant, or operator at his or her expense.


#### 21.16.340 - Right of entry for inspection.

The Director of Seattle Public Utilities or other City officials or employees of the City, bearing proper credentials and identification, may with the consent of the occupant or with the consent of the owner of unoccupied premises or pursuant to a lawfully issued warrant enter upon any and all premises at all reasonable times, or during an emergency at any time, for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing of sewers and sewage waste in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.


#### 21.16.350 - Authority to make rules and regulations.

The Director of Seattle Public Utilities and the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections may make rules and regulations and amend the same from time to time, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter 21.16, as either or both shall deem necessary and convenient to carry out the provisions of this Chapter 21.16.

        4. Anyone violating this chapter who has had a judgment, final Director's order, or Director's review decision against them for a prior violation of this chapter in the preceding five years.

#### 21.16.354 - Liability and defenses of responsible parties.

1. Who Must Comply. It is the specific intent of this chapter to place the obligation of complying with its requirements upon the responsible parties, as defined in Section 21.16.030. The City and its agencies are intended to have the same obligation for compliance when the City is a responsible party. No provision of this chapter is intended to impose any other duty upon the City or any of its officers or employees.

    1. Joint and Several Liability. Each responsible party is jointly and severally liable for a violation of this chapter. The Director may take enforcement action, in whole or in part, against any responsible party. All applicable civil penalties may be imposed against each responsible party.
    2. Allocation of Damages. In the event enforcement action is taken against more than one responsible party, recoverable damages, costs, and expenses may be allocated among the responsible parties by the court based upon the extent to which each responsible party's acts or omissions caused the violation. If this factor cannot be determined the court may consider:

        1. Awareness of the violation;
        2. Ability to correct the violation;
        3. Ability to pay the damages, costs, and expenses;
        4. Cooperation with government agencies;
        5. Degree to which any impact or threatened impact on water or sediment quality, human health, the environment, or public or private property is related to acts or omissions by each responsible party;
        6. Degree to which the responsible parties made good-faith efforts to avoid a violation or to mitigate its consequences; and
        7. Other equitable factors.
2. Defenses. A responsible party shall not be liable for civil violations under this chapter when the responsible party proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, one of the following:

    1. The violation was caused solely by an act of God;
    2. The violation was caused solely by another responsible party over whom the defending responsible party had no authority or control and the defending responsible party could not have reasonably prevented the violation;
    3. The violation was caused solely by a prior owner or occupant when the defending responsible party took possession of the property without knowledge of the violation, after using reasonable efforts to identify violations. However, the defending responsible party shall be liable for all continuing, recurrent, or new violations after becoming the owner or occupant; or
    4. The responsible party implemented and maintained all appropriate side sewer structures, equipment, treatment facilities, and pretreatment facilities identified in rules promulgated by the Director or as otherwise identified and required of the responsible party by the Director in writing.

#### 21.16.356 - Right of entry for enforcement.

With the consent of the owner or occupant of a building, premises, or property, or pursuant to a lawfully issued warrant, the Director may enter a building, premises, or property at any reasonable time to perform the duties imposed by this chapter.


#### 21.16.358 - Enforcement actions.

1. Investigation. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities may investigate any site where there is reason to believe that there may be a failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
2. Notice of Violation.

    1. Issuance. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is authorized to issue a Notice of Violation to a responsible party, whenever the Director determines that a violation of this chapter has occurred or is occurring. The Notice of Violation shall be considered an order of the Director.
    2. Contents.

        1. The Notice of Violation shall include the following information:

            1. A description of the violation and the action necessary to correct it;
            2. The date of the notice; and
            3. A deadline by which the action necessary to correct the violation must be completed.
        2. A Notice of Violation may be amended at any time to correct clerical errors, add citations of authority, or modify required corrective action.
    3. Service. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities shall serve the Notice of Violation upon a responsible party either by personal service, by first class mail, or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the party's last known address. If the address of the responsible party cannot be found after a reasonable search, the notice may be served by posting a copy of the notice at a conspicuous place on the property. Alternatively, if the whereabouts of the responsible party is unknown and cannot be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the Director makes an affidavit to that effect, then service may be accomplished by publishing the notice once each week for two consecutive weeks in the City official newspaper.
    4. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to obligate or require the Director to issue a Notice of Violation or order prior to the initiation of enforcement action by the City Attorney's Office pursuant to Subsection 21.16.358E.
3. Stop Work and Emergency Orders.

    1. Stop Work Order. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities may order work on a site stopped when the Director determines it is necessary to do so in order to obtain compliance with or to correct a violation of any provision of this chapter or rules promulgated hereunder or to correct a violation of a permit or approval granted under this chapter.

        1. The stop work notice shall contain the following information:

            1. A description of the violation; and
            2. An order that the work be stopped until corrective action has been completed and approved by the Director.
        2. The stop work order shall be personally served on the responsible party or posted conspicuously on the premises.
    2. Emergency Order.

        1. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities may order a responsible party to take emergency corrective action and set a schedule for compliance and or may require immediate compliance with an emergency order to correct when the Director determines that it is necessary to do so in order to obtain immediate compliance with or to correct a violation of any provision of this chapter, or to correct a violation of a permit or approval granted under this chapter.
        2. An emergency order shall be personally served on the responsible party or posted conspicuously on the premises.
        3. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is authorized to enter any property to investigate and correct a condition associated with a side sewer when it reasonably appears that the condition creates a substantial and present or imminent danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or public or private property. The Director may enter property without permission or an administrative warrant in the case of an extreme emergency placing human life, property or the environment in immediate and substantial jeopardy which requires corrective action before either permission or an administrative warrant can be obtained. The cost of such emergency corrective action shall be collected as set forth in Section 21.16.364.
        4. Director's Review of Stop Work Order and Emergency Order. A stop work order or emergency order shall be final and not subject to a Director's review.
4. Review by Director.

    1. A Notice of Violation, Director's order, or invoice issued pursuant to this chapter shall be final and not subject to further appeal unless an aggrieved party requests in writing a review by the Director within ten days after service of the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice. When the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5:00 p.m. on the next business day.
    2. Following receipt of a request for review, the Director shall notify the requesting party, any persons served the Notice of Violation, order or invoice, and any person who has requested notice of the review, that the request for review has been received by the Director. Additional information for consideration as part of the review shall be submitted to the Director no later than 15 days after the written request for a review is mailed.
    3. The Director will review the basis for issuance of the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice and all information received by the deadline for submission of additional information for consideration as part of the review. The Director may request clarification of information received and a site visit. After the review is completed, the Director may:

        1. Sustain the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice;
        2. Withdraw the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice;
        3. Continue the review to a date certain for receipt of additional information; or
        4. Modify or amend the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice.
    4. The Director's decision shall become final and is not subject to further administrative appeal.
5. Referral to City Attorney for Enforcement. If a responsible party fails to correct a violation or pay a penalty as required by a Notice of Violation, or fails to comply with a Director's order, the Director shall refer the matter to the City Attorney's Office for civil or criminal enforcement action. Civil actions to enforce a violation of this chapter shall be brought exclusively in Municipal Court.
6. Appeal to Superior Court. Because civil actions to enforce this chapter are brought exclusively in Municipal Court, notices of violation, orders, and all other actions made under this chapter are not subject to judicial review under chapter 36.70C RCW. Instead, final decisions of the Municipal Court on enforcement actions authorized by this chapter may be appealed under the Rules for Appeals of Decisions of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction.
7. Filing of Notice or Order. A Notice of Violation, voluntary compliance agreement, or an order issued by the Director or court may be filed with the King County Department of Records and Elections.
8. Change of Ownership. When a Notice of Violation, voluntary compliance agreement or an order issued by the Director or court has been filed with the King County Department of Records and Elections, a Notice of Violation or an order regarding the same violations need not be served upon a new owner of the property where the violation occurred. If no Notice of Violation or order is served upon the new owner, the Director may grant the new owner the same number of days to comply as was given the previous owner. The compliance period for the new owner shall begin on the date that the conveyance of title to the new owner is completed.

#### 21.16.360 - Voluntary compliance agreement.

1. Initiation. Either a responsible party or the Director may initiate negotiations for a voluntary compliance agreement at any time. Neither has any obligation to enter into a voluntary compliance agreement.
2. Contents. A voluntary compliance agreement shall identify actions to be taken by the responsible party that will correct past or existing violations of this chapter. The agreement may also identify actions to mitigate the impacts of violations. The agreement shall contain a schedule for completion of the corrective actions and any mitigating actions. The agreement shall contain a provision allowing the Director to inspect the premises to determine compliance with the agreement. The agreement shall provide that the responsible party agrees the City may perform the actions set forth in the agreement if the responsible party fails to do so according to the terms and schedule of the agreement, and the responsible party will pay the costs, expenses, and damages the City incurs in performing the actions, as set forth in Section 21.16.364.
3. Effect of Agreement.

    1. A voluntary compliance agreement is a binding contract between the party executing it and the City. It is not enforceable by any other party. By entering into a voluntary compliance agreement, a responsible party waives the right to a Director's Review of the Notice of Violation or order.
    2. Penalties may be reduced or waived if violations are corrected or mitigated according to the terms and schedule of a voluntary compliance agreement. If the responsible party fails to perform according to the terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance agreement, penalties for each violation addressed in the agreement may be assessed starting from the date the violation occurred, or as otherwise provided for in a Notice of Violation or Director's order.
4. Modification. The terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance agreement may be modified by mutual agreement of the responsible party and the Director if there exist circumstances or conditions outside the responsible party's control, or unknown at the time the agreement was made, or if other just cause necessitate such modifications.

#### 21.16.362 - Penalties and damages.

1. Assessment of Penalties by the Director. The Director, after considering all available information, may assess a penalty for each violation of this chapter based upon the Schedule of Civil Penalties.
2. Schedule of Civil Penalties. The Director shall determine penalties as follows:

    1. Basic Penalty.

        1. Maximum Penalty. A violation of this chapter is subject to a maximum civil penalty of up to $5,000. Each day or portion thereof during which a violation of this chapter exists is a separate violation of this chapter.
        2. Commencement Date. The penalty shall commence on the date of the violation, unless otherwise provided for in a Notice of Violation or Director's order.
        3. Assessment Matrix. The penalty shall be assessed using a matrix of criteria and scored as defined in rules promulgated by the Director. The total score will equate with a penalty up to a maximum of $5,000 for each violation. The penalty shall be rated for severity by using the criteria listed below and by answering "No", "Possibly", "Probably", or "Definitely":

            1. Does the violation pose a public health risk;
            2. Does the violation cause environmental damage or adversely impact infrastructure;
            3. Was the responsible party willful or knowing of the violation;
            4. Was the responsible party unresponsive in correcting the violation;
            5. Was there improper operation or maintenance;
            6. Was there a failure to obtain necessary permits or approval;
            7. Does the violation provide economic benefit for non-compliance; and
            8. Was the violation a repeat violation.
3. Penalty for Significant Violation. For violations causing significant harm to public health, safety, welfare, the environment, or private or public property, the Director may, as an alternative to the Basic Penalty, refer the matter to the City Attorney's Office for enforcement and request the City Attorney seek a penalty equivalent to the economic benefit the responsible party derived from the violation. "Significant harm" is damage or injury which cannot be fully corrected or mitigated by the responsible party, and which cannot be adequately compensated for by assessment of the Basic Penalty and costs, expenses, or damages under this chapter. Economic benefit may be determined by savings in costs realized by the responsible party, value received by the responsible party, increased income to the responsible party, increase in market value of property, or any other method reasonable under the circumstances.
4. Damages. Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall, in addition to any penalties provided for such violation, be liable for any: investigation cost, cost to correct, or other cost; expense; loss; or damage incurred by the City, plus a charge of 15 percent for administrative costs. This chapter does not establish a cause of action that may be asserted by any party other than the City. Penalties, damages, costs and expenses may be recovered only by the City.
5. Effect of Payment of Penalties. The responsible party named in a Notice of Violation or order is not relieved of the duty to correct the violation by paying civil penalties.

#### 21.16.364 - Collection of costs and penalties.

1. Invoice and Demand for Payment of Investigation and Correction Costs. The Director may issue an invoice and demand for payment of the City's costs and expenses when the Director has investigated or corrected a violation of this chapter. The invoice shall include:

    1. The amount of the City's investigation and correction costs, which include, but are not limited to:

        1. Billed cost including labor, administration, overhead, overtime, profit, taxes, and other related costs for a hired contractor to investigate and/or perform the abatement work;

        6. Cost of equipment, materials, and supplies, including all related expenses for purchasing, renting, and leasing;
        7. Laboratory costs and analytical expenses;
        8. Cost of mobilization, disposal of materials, and cleanup; and
        9. Any associated permit fees:
    2. Either a legal description of the property corresponding as nearly as possible to that used for the property on the rolls of the King County Assessor or, where available, the property's street address;
    3. Notice that the responsible party may request a Director's review pursuant to Subsection 21.16.358D;
    4. Notice that if the amount due is not paid within 30 days, the unpaid amount may be collected in any of the manners identified in subsection C of this section; and
    5. Notice that interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance if not paid within 30 days after the invoice date.
2. Invoice and Demand for Payment of Civil Penalties. The Director may issue an invoice and demand for payment of civil penalties when the responsible party has failed to pay a penalty by the deadline in a Notice of Violation or order and has failed to request a Director's review within the required time periods established in Subsection 21.16.358D. The invoice shall include:

    1. The amount of the penalty;
    2. Either a legal description of the property corresponding as nearly as possible to that used for the property on the rolls of the King County Assessor or, where available, the property's street address;
    3. Notice that if the amount due is not paid within 30 days, the unpaid amount may be collected in any of the manners identified in subsection C of this section; and
    4. Notice that interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance if not paid within 30 days after the invoice date.
3. Collection Following a Judicial Review. If a court has issued an order or judgment imposing penalties, costs, damages, or expenses for a violation of this chapter, and the court's order or judgment is not appealed within 30 days, the Director may:

    1. Refer the matter to the City Attorney to initiate appropriate enforcement action; or
    2. After consultation with the City Attorney, refer the matter to a collection agency; or
    3. Add a surcharge in the amount owed under the order to the bill for drainage and wastewater services to the site. If unpaid, the surcharge may become a lien on the property, may be foreclosed, and may accrue interest as provided by state law or Section 21.33.110 of the Seattle Municipal Code.

#### 21.16.366 - Public nuisance.

1. Dysfunctional Facility or Practice; Abatement Required. Any private side sewer not installed or maintained as required by this chapter, or otherwise found to be in a state of dysfunction creating a threat to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or public or private property is a public nuisance and is a violation of this chapter. A responsible party shall immediately abate a public nuisance upon becoming aware of its existence.
2. Abatement by the City. The Director is authorized, but not required, to investigate a condition that the Director suspects of being a public nuisance under this chapter, and to abate any public nuisance. If a public nuisance is an immediate threat to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment, the Director may summarily and without prior notice abate the condition. The Director shall give notice of the abatement to the responsible party as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement.
3. Collection of Abatement Costs. The costs of abatement may be collected from the responsible party, including, a reasonable charge for attorney time, and a 15 percent surcharge for administrative expenses as set forth in Subsection 21.16.362D. Abatement costs and other damages, expenses and penalties collected by the City shall go into an abatement account for the department collecting the moneys. The money in the abatement account shall be used for abatements, investigations and corrections of violations performed by the City. When the account is insufficient the Director may use other available funds.

#### 21.16.368 - Additional relief.

In addition to any remedy provided in this chapter, the Director may seek any other legal or equitable remedy to enjoin any acts or practices or abate any condition that constitutes or will constitute a violation of this chapter or a public nuisance.


#### 21.16.370 - Suspension or revocation.

Approvals or permits granted on the basis of inaccurate or misleading information may be suspended or revoked. Other permits or approvals interrelated with an approval suspended or revoked under this section, including certificates of occupancy or approvals for occupancy, may also be suspended or revoked. When an approval or permit is suspended or revoked, the Director may require the applicant to take corrective action to bring the project into compliance with this chapter by a deadline set by the Director, or may take other enforcement action.


#### 21.16.372 - Financial assurance and covenants.

As a condition precedent to issuance of any permit or approval provided for in this chapter, the Director may require an applicant for a permit or approval to submit financial assurances as provided in this section.


1. Insurance.

    1. The Director may require the property owners or contractor to carry liability and property damage insurance naming the City as an additional insured. The amount, as determined by the Director, shall be commensurate with the risks.
    2. The Director may also require the property owners to maintain a policy of general public liability insurance against personal injury, death, property damage and/or loss from activities conducted pursuant to the permit or approval, or conditions caused by such activities, and naming the City as an additional insured. The amount, as determined by the Director, shall be commensurate with the risks. It shall cover a period of not more than ten years from the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy or finalization of the permit or approval. A certificate evidencing such insurance shall be filed with the Director before issuing a certificate of occupancy or finalizing a permit for any single family dwelling or duplex.
    3. The insurance policy shall provide that the City will be notified of cancellation of the policy at least 30 days prior to cancellation. The notice shall be sent to the Director who required the insurance and shall state the insured's name and the property address. If a property owner's insurance is canceled and not replaced, the permit or approval and any interrelated permit or approval may be revoked, including a certificate of occupancy or approval for occupancy.
2. Bonds, Cash Deposits or Instruments of Credit.

    1. Surety Bond.

        1. The Director may require that the property owners or contractor deliver to the Director for filing in the Office of the City Clerk a surety bond, cash deposit or an instrument of credit in such form and amounts deemed by the Director to be necessary to ensure that requirements of the permit or approval are met. A surety bond may be furnished only by a surety company licensed to do business in the State of Washington. The bond shall be conditioned that the work will be completed in accordance with the conditions of the permit or approval, or, if the work is not completed, that the site will be left in a safe condition. The bond shall also be conditioned that the site and nearby, adjacent or surrounding areas will be restored if damaged or made unsafe by activities conducted pursuant to the permit or approval.
        2. The bond will be exonerated one year after a determination by the Director that the requirements of the permit or approval have been met. For work under a building permit or side sewer permit, issuance of a certificate of occupancy or approval for occupancy following a final inspection shall be considered to be such a determination. For work under a separate side sewer permit, the Director's approval after completion of the final side sewer inspection and submittal of all required documents shall be such a determination.
    2. Assurance in Lieu of Surety Bond. In lieu of a surety bond, the owner may elect to file a cash deposit or instrument of credit with the Director in an amount equal to that which would be required in the surety bond and in a form approved by the Director. The cash deposit or instrument of credit shall comply with the same conditions as required for surety bonds.
3. Covenants.

    1. The Director may require a covenant between the property owners and the City. The covenant shall be signed by the owners of the site and notarized prior to issuing any permit or approval in a potential landslide area, potentially hazardous location, flood prone zone, or other area of potentially hazardous soils or drainage or erosion conditions. The covenant shall not be required where the permit or approval is for work done by the City. The covenant shall include:

        1. A legal description of the property;
        2. A description of the property condition making this subsection applicable;
        3. A statement that the owners of the property understand and accept the responsibility for the risks associated with development on the property given the described condition, and agree to inform future purchasers and other successors and assignees of the risks;
        4. The application date, type, and number of the permit or approval for which the covenant is required; and
        5. A statement waiving the right of the owners, and the owners' heirs, successors, and assigns, to assert any claim against the City by reason of or arising out of issuance of the permit or approval by the City for the development on the property, except only for such losses that may directly result from the sole negligence of the City.
    2. The covenant shall be filed by the Director with the King County Department of Records and Elections, at the expense of the owners, so as to become part of the King County real property records.

#### 21.16.380 - Reserved.

#### 21.16.390 - Liability for injury or damage.

Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to be nor shall be construed to create or form the basis for any liability on the part of the City, or its officers, employees or agents, for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of a side sewer to conform to the provisions of this chapter, or by reason or in consequence of any inspection, notice, order, certificate, permission or approval authorized, issued or done or failure to act in connection with the implementation or enforcement of this chapter, or by reason of any action or inaction on the part of the city related in any manner to the enforcement of this chapter by its officers, employees or agents.



### Chapter 21.20 - SEWER CONNECTIONS OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS

Sections:

#### 21.20.010 - Connections authorized.

Pursuant to authority granted by RCW 35.67.310 the Director of Seattle Public Utilities is authorized to enter into agreements for and on behalf of the City with the owners of property beyond the City limits permitting connection of such property with the City's sewers upon the terms, conditions and subject to the payments prescribed in this chapter when, in the judgment of the Director of Seattle Public Utilities, such connections will not overload or imperil the City's sewer system.


#### 21.20.020 - Specifications of agreement.

1. Such agreement shall specify the property to be connected with the City sewer system; shall grant permission for connection upon payment of prescribed fees and charges therefor; shall require the property owners to construct such connection in accordance with City plans and specifications and under the supervision of the Director of Seattle Public Utilities, without cost or expense to the City; shall provide that the property owner shall not allow any additional property to be served by such connection until the owner of such additional property has executed a similar agreement, except that two (2) or more property owners may join in one (1) connection agreement; shall require such property owner to pay any sewerage utility charge fixed by ordinance and also an amount equivalent to side sewer permit fees and special connection charges fixed by ordinance for like property within the City, which special connection charge shall be paid in cash or in installments with interest at the same rate as the effective annual interest rate of the most recent Seattle Local Improvement District Bond Issue computed annually on unpaid balances; shall agree that the City in the event the terms and conditions of said agreement are not faithfully kept and performed may disconnect the sewer serving the property from the City's system and for that purpose shall authorize the Director of Seattle Public Utilities to enter upon the premises of such property owner; and shall provide that in such event the payment made for such connection shall be forfeited to the City and no credit shall be allowed therefor if such property is later reconnected to the City sewer system upon approval of a new application therefor and shall further provide that such agreement shall be filed for record in the office of the Director of Records and Elections of King County, Washington, and shall constitute a covenant running with the land binding upon the property owner, his heirs and assigns, and upon any parties subsequently acquiring any right, title or interest in said property.
2. In the event that such agreement provides for payment of the special connection charge in installments, such agreement shall further provide for a down payment of five (5) percent of the total connection charge, payable upon execution of such agreement and for payment of the balance in forty (40) quarterly installments payable on each January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st, and shall further provide that any unpaid balance may be paid in full in any year at the time the first quarterly payment of such year is due and payable.

#### 21.24.030 - Special connection charge—Imposed.

1. In addition to sewer connection permit fees required by Section 21.16.070, there is imposed upon, and the owners of properties which have not been assessed or charged or borne an equitable share of the cost of the City's sewerage system shall pay prior to connection to a City sewer, a special connection charge in an amount to be computed under Section 21.24.040.
2. The special connection charge shall be paid in cash or under installment contract with interest thereon at a rate commensurate with the annual one year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank, for the year connection is made with the City sewer, computed annually on unpaid balances. Such contract shall provide for a down payment of 5 percent of the total connection charge, payable upon execution of such contract and for payment of the balance in 40 quarterly installments payable on each January 1st, April 1st, July 1st and October 1st. Such installment contract shall provide that any unpaid balance may be paid in full in any year at the time the first quarterly payment of such year is due and payable, shall describe the property served by the sewer, shall be acknowledged by the property owner and shall be recorded by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities in the office of the King County Records and Elections Division at the expense of the property owner. Delinquent payments under such installment contract shall be a lien upon the described property as provided in RCW 35.67.200, enforceable in accordance with RCW 35.67.220 through 35.67.280; and as an additional and concurrent method of enforcing the lien, the water service to such property may be cut off in accordance with RCW 35.67.290 until the delinquent installments are paid. Upon full payment of the contract, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities on behalf of the City shall execute and deliver to the property owner a release of such lien.

#### 21.24.040 - Special connection charge—Computation.

1. The special connection charge imposed by Section 21.24.030 shall be paid into the Drainage and Wastewater Fund and, in order that property owners bear their equitable share of the cost of the sewer system, shall be computed as follows:

    1. For Lateral Sewers. The number of units of property frontage to be served by the sewer, determined in the manner prescribed in RCW 35.44.030 and 35.44.040 for determining "assessable units of frontage" or by such other method or combination of methods of computing assessments which may be deemed to more fairly reflect the special benefits to the property being assessed as authorized by RCW 35.44.047, shall be multiplied by the average local improvement assessment per unit of frontage for lateral sewers in Seattle for the year in which the sewer to which the property is to be connected was constructed and accepted as completed, provided that, for all sewers that are connected more than one year after the City sewer was constructed, interest shall be added thereto at a rate commensurate with the annual one year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank, for the year the City sewer was or is completed and available for connection until the connection is made, but excluding both the year of completion of construction and the year connection is made; except that for connection to sewers constructed prior to 1953, interest shall be added thereto at the one year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, for the year 1953. Interest charged pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed 10 percent per year and shall not exceed ten years.
    2. For Trunk Sewers. The number of square feet of property area to be served by the sewer shall be multiplied by the average local improvement assessment per square foot for trunk sewers in Seattle for the year in which the trunk sewer to which the lateral sewers serving the property are connected was constructed and accepted, provided that, for all sewers that are connected more than one year after the City sewer was constructed, interest shall be added thereto at a rate commensurate with the annual one year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank, for the year the City sewer was or is completed and available for connection until the connection is made, but excluding both the year of completion of construction and the year connection is made, except that, for connection to sewers constructed prior to 1953, interest shall be added thereto at the one year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, for the year 1953. Interest charged pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed 10 percent per year and shall not exceed ten years.
2. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is authorized to annually compute and establish the average local improvement assessment paid by property owners for lateral and trunk sewers completed and accepted by the City during the previous calendar year which average assessment shall be used by him or her in computing the special connection charge imposed in Section 21.24.030 as to sewer improvements completed in 1965 and thereafter. A copy of such computation shall be delivered to the City Clerk not later than February 1st of each such year to be filed by him in C.F. 253991.
3. The Director shall file with the City Clerk in C.F. 253991 the annual one year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank for each calendar year commencing with 1953. Such information shall be delivered to the City Clerk not later than April 1st for each preceding year.
4. The collection of the special connection charge to serve a residence may be deferred at the request of a person responsible for its payment who is economically disadvantaged, as defined in Section 20.12.020.B of the Seattle Municipal Code and both owns and occupies the residence which will be connected to the City system. Interest on deferred charges shall be computed at the same rate as provided in subsection A of Section 21.24.030 as if payment were being made in a timely manner under an installment contract. A request for deferral must be made 30 days prior to levy of the special connection charge. All charges, including interest, so deferred, shall become due and payable in full at the time of sale or transfer of the property.
5. Such special connection charge for property abutting on a street in which a sewer can be constructed or extended to serve such property, shall be computed as if the sewer were so constructed or extended; and the special connection charge for property located back from the margin of the street in which the sewer exists and outside of the assessment district created therefor shall be made giving consideration to the distance of the property from the street margin. In no case shall credit be allowed for the cost of extra length of side sewer required for connection to the City's sewerage system; provided, that in cases where application of the foregoing formula to a particular property results in a charge which because of unusual conditions is in excess of charges to similar properties, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities is authorized to reduce the special connection charge to the amount charged to properties similarly situated.
6. For connection to side sewers constructed by the City, the property owner for whose benefit connection is made shall pay the cost of the side sewer. The cost shall be computed as follows: The actual cost to the City of the side sewer, plus 15 percent for City design and administrative costs, plus interest at a rate commensurate with the annual one year rate for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, adjusted for constant maturities, as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin or otherwise available from the Federal Reserve Bank, for the year the City sewer was or is completed and available for connection and applied until the connection is made, but excluding both the year of completion of construction and the year connection is made.

#### 21.24.050 - Special connection charge—Credit to Local Improvement District Fund.

If property for which a special connection charge has been paid is subsequently included in a local improvement district for the construction of a sewer of similar nature, the amount so paid shall be credited to the assessment against such property and such amount shall be paid from the Sewer Fund to such Local Improvement District Fund.


#### 21.24.070 - Fee payment.

The fee shall be paid to the Director of Finance and Administrative Services before the permit is issued and the amount of the fee paid shall be shown on the permit and on the record of the side sewer connection maintained in the office of the Director of Seattle Public Utilities.


#### 21.24.080 - Violation of Sections 21.24.030 through 21.24.070.

Any violation of or failure to comply with the provisions of Sections 21.24.030 through 21.24.070 shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $300 or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 90 days, or both.


#### 21.24.090 - Reserved.

#### 21.24.100 - Refund of special sewer connection charge.

Whenever pursuant to Ordinance 82583, as amended a special sewer connection charge shall have been paid on behalf of a property within the City limits, or pursuant to Ordinance 85317, as amended** a special sewer connection charge shall have been paid on behalf of property outside the City limits, and such charge shall have been incorrectly computed, duplicate a previous charge imposed and collected pursuant to the authority of either such ordinance, or be otherwise erroneous and an application is made for a refund, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities may authorize the same, such authorization to be in writing and accompanied by a statement of the facts justifying such refund and the amount approved.

#### 21.28.040 - Wastewater volume charge

1. There is hereby imposed upon all premises for which Seattle Public Utilities provides wastewater services and on which water is consumed a wastewater volume charge for wastewater services. The wastewater volume charge shall be calculated in accordance with this SMC Chapter 21.28 and shall be based on the measured volume of water from all sources consumed on the premises, except that there shall be a minimum wastewater volume charge for one (1) CCF per month to cover billing and general administrative costs. The following premises shall be exempt from the wastewater volume charge:

    1. Premises which are not connected and not required under SMC Section 21.16.040 (Section 3 of Ordinance 97016) to be connected to the public sewer system;
    2. Premises, the owner, agent, lessee, or occupant of which has not been notified in accordance with SMC Section 21.16.040 (Section 4 of Ordinance 97016) to connect to the public sewer system.
2. The wastewater volume rate shall be the sum of the treatment rate and the system rate, as follows:

    1. Treatment rate. The "treatment rate" shall be the rate required to pay the wastewater share of "treatment cost," which is the cost of wastewater treatment, interception and disposal services and any associated costs required to meet Drainage and Wastewater Fund financial policies. The treatment rate shall be the amount obtained when (a) the projected wastewater treatment cost is divided by (b) the projected billed wastewater consumption, each for the next calendar year, and the result is multiplied by 116.9 percent to cover the costs of taxes and low-income rate assistance. The projected treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the upcoming calendar year, which may include an adjustment to reflect the difference, whether positive or negative, between the total expected treatment cost for the current year and the total wastewater volume charge revenues attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current year. The treatment rate is designed to pass through cost changes driven by King County and may be adjusted by ordinance at any time in response to such charges.
    2. System rate. The "system rate" shall be the rate required to pay the cost of carrying and discharging all wastewater and any wastewater-funded share of stormwater into the City sewerage system, as presently maintained and operated and as may be added to, improved, and extended.
    3. The wastewater volume rate per CCF shall be in accordance with the following schedule:
3. For so long as any franchise fee is imposed by the City of Shoreline on The City of Seattle's operation of its sewer system in the City of Shoreline, the wastewater volume charge imposed on premises within the City of Shoreline shall include a City of Shoreline franchise charge of Two Dollars and Thirty-one Cents ($2.31) per month.

#### 21.28.080 - Calculation of residential wastewater volume charge.

1. It is the intent of this section to calculate residential wastewater charges based on water that should enter the sewerage system, and not on water used exclusively for irrigation or sprinkling. Wastewater charges for single-family and duplex residences shall be calculated in the following manner: For the six (6) months from November 1st through April 30th, the wastewater charge shall be based on metered water consumption. For the six (6) months from May 1st through October 31st, the wastewater charge shall be based on average winter water consumption or metered water consumption, whichever is less. Average winter water consumption shall be calculated using the first four (4) month billing period that falls between November 1st and April 30th. The following is an example of residential billing:
2. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities may use an assumed volume of five and two-tenths (5.2) CCF per household, or prior water consumption records if those records are more representative of expected usage, to calculate residential wastewater charges under the following circumstances:

    1. When the water meter has been determined to be malfunctioning;
    2. When customers have insufficient water consumption history to calculate average winter water consumption;
    3. When water use in the period used to calculate average winter water consumption is not representative of expected water use, such as rental property that is vacant between tenants or in the case of seasonal customers; and
    4. When customers are not served by a publicly owned water supply system.

#### 21.28.090 - Calculation of commercial wastewater volume charge.

1. It is the intent of this section to charge commercial customers for water that should enter the sewer system. Wastewater charges shall be based on the metered water delivered to the premises except as noted below:

Where it is impractical to install a meter as described above, customers may apply to the Director of Seattle Public Utilities for an evaporation allowance or an irrigation allowance, provided that customers provide proof of the amount of water so used or lost. Evaporation loss allowances of eleven (11) percent for industrial laundries and three (3) percent for laundromats are established. Irrigation allowances shall apply from June 1st through September 30th and will be calculated based on the residential methodology in Section 21.28.080.


    1. Water metered exclusively for fire service, sprinkling, irrigation or delivery of water to ships shall not be subject to any wastewater charge or rate.
    2. Where the use of water is such that a portion of all water used is lost by evaporation, irrigation, sprinkling or other cause, or is used in manufactured goods and commodities, customers may install, at their own expense, submeters approved by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities to enable measurement of the amount of water so used or lost. These submeters must measure in CCF, must be calibrated on a regular basis, and must be easily accessible for meter reading. If the submeter is unable to be read or if the reading is unreliable, an estimate can be used, but the Seattle Public Utilities must get at least one (1) accurate meter reading per year. It will be the responsibility of the Seattle Public Utilities or its designee to inspect and approve the installation of a new submeter.
2. Direct discharge of wastewater or industrial waste to salt or fresh water or to points other than the City sewer system shall not be cause for adjustment or reduction of the wastewater charge or rate.

#### 21.28.100 - Adjustments to wastewater volume charge.

1. Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of hidden or underground water leakage, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities shall adjust the wastewater volume charge to the premises for water so lost and shall not use the period during which such leakage occurs in computing the average winter water consumption when to do so would result in a higher wastewater charge to such premises, provided that no such adjustment shall be made for leakage occurring more than four (4) months prior to the date of application therefor.
2. Where wastewater service is provided to premises outside the City limits, the wastewater charge shall be computed on the same basis as premises located inside the City, except that a sum equal to thirty (30) percent of the waste-water charge shall be added, with the exception of sewer districts, or portions thereof, outside the City limits which are now or may hereafter be covered by special agreements.
3. Where wastewater service is provided to qualified low-income customers as defined in Section 21.76.030 B of the Seattle Municipal Code, wastewater charges shall be partially offset in accordance with that chapter.

#### 21.28.200 - Wastes which would damage or overburden system.

1. In cases where the character of wastewater or industrial wastes from any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it will damage the sewerage system, or cannot be treated satisfactorily, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities shall require such users to dispose of such waste and prevent it from entering the system.
2. In cases where the character of the industrial waste from any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it imposes an unreasonable burden upon the sewerage system greater than that imposed by the average wastewater entering the system, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities may by rule, require such manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises, to pretreat such wastewater by means satisfactory to the Director of Seattle Public Utilities before discharging such wastewater into the sewerage system of the City.
3. If such pretreatment is not accomplished, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities shall recommend to the Council the levying of a surcharge which shall be in addition to the regular charge. The Council thereupon, by ordinance, may fix the amount of the surcharge.

#### 21.28.220 - High Strength Industrial Wastewater (HSIW) charges.

1. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is assigned the responsibility for billing and collecting for and on behalf of King County, King County's High Strength Industrial Waste (HSIW) charges upon industrial users within the City's jurisdiction who deposit high strength industrial wastes in the King County sewerage system, said charges to be determined by King County pursuant to Metro Resolution 2557 provided, however, that the Director of Seattle Public Utilities shall not bill such charges to users until the amounts thereof have been certified to him or her by King County.
2. The Director of Seattle Public Utilities shall provide King County each quarter with a listing of the water consumption by or metered flow to each HSIW industry served by the City.
3. In addition to the High Strength Industrial Waste charges as computed and certified to him or her by King County, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities shall add thereto in each instance a sum equal to the City and state taxes against such charges, if any, and a sum equal to the user's proportional share of the administration, billing and collection costs as determined by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities, and in connection with such billing the Director of Seattle Public Utilities may include on the same statement but as a separate item the High Strength Industrial Waste charges to be collected by the City for and on behalf of King County.

#### 21.28.230 - Standard and Administrative Charges.

1. The Director shall develop and update annually a schedule of charges for standard, recurring services which are incidental to the provision of wastewater service. Such charges shall be based on a review of the prevailing actual costs for providing these services.
2. Any standard charges, including administrative charges, shall be developed and adopted pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02).

#### 21.28.250 - Wastewater charges—When payable.

The wastewater charge provided in this chapter shall be payable at the office of the Director of Finance and Administrative Services at the same time as the water bill for the premises is payable.


#### 21.28.260 - Billing and collection of wastewater charges.

The rates and charges set out in this chapter shall be effective and shall be computed and billed monthly or bimonthly by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities, as a separate charge on the water bill, or through a direct invoice, and shall become due and payable to the City of Seattle as stated in such billing; and any wastewater rate or charge which becomes delinquent shall immediately become a lien upon the premises and such lien may be foreclosed by the City as provided by state law. Wastewater charges or any part thereof which become delinquent shall bear interest as authorized by RCW 35.67.200, at the rate of 8-percent per year, or such rate as may hereafter be authorized by state law, computed on a monthly basis. Interest shall be added to all wastewater charges that remain unpaid 30 days or more from their billing date and shall continue until such charges are paid. As authorized, RCW 35.67.200 shall have the effect and the City shall have a lien for all delinquent and unpaid wastewater charges, including interest thereon, against any parcel for which the wastewater charges are delinquent. The lien shall have superiority as established by RCW 35.67.200 and shall be foreclosed or otherwise enforced in the manner provided in RCW 35.67.210 through RCW 35.67.290. In the case of actions to collect delinquencies, the City shall seek also to collect reimbursement of reasonable costs of collection including but not limited to attorney's fees, staff time, and filing fees. As an additional and concurrent method of the collection of any such wastewater rate or charge, the Director of Seattle Public Utilities shall have the authority to cut off the water service or supply from the premises to which such rate or charge for wastewater has attached until such rates and charges are paid.


#### 21.28.270 - Contracting with other sewer districts.

Whenever and to the extent that the municipal sewerage system of the City is adequate therefor, the City may contract with any sewer district, or with any other municipal corporation, for the discharge into the sewerage system of the City of the wastewater or drainage of any such sewer district or other municipal corporation upon such terms and conditions and for such periods of time as may be provided by ordinance.


#### 21.28.280 - Drainage and Wastewater Fund.

There exists a special fund of the City known as the "Drainage and Wastewater Fund."

Such expenses shall include the cost of billing and collection by the Seattle Public Utilities and all other interdepartmental charges for services related to wastewater functions rendered by other departments for the Seattle Public Utilities, and payments to King County and Southwest Suburban for wastewater interception, treatment and disposal.


#### 21.28.290 - Review of rates and charges.

The rates and charges for wastewater fixed by this chapter shall be reviewed periodically with a view to possible adjustments consistent with the operation and maintenance of the wastewater utility system in sound financial condition, including the utility's ability to pay wastewater treatment expenses charged by King County.


#### 21.28.350 - Refunds of wastewater charges.

The Director of Seattle Public Utilities is authorized to make refunds where any amount paid for wastewater services is found to be erroneous, or where adjustments have been made by him or her as authorized by this chapter, and the Director of Finance and Administrative Services is authorized to draw and to pay the necessary warrants on the Drainage and Wastewater Fund upon certification by the Director of Seattle Public Utilities that the refund is authorized. If the applicable fund is solvent at the time payment is ordered, the Director may elect to make payment by check, electronic payment or credit card.


#### 21.28.400 - Severability.

The provisions of this chapter are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof.

1. SPU shall provide a 10 percent reduction in the drainage service charge for parcels containing new or remodeled commercial buildings that, after July 27, 2003, install and utilize rainwater harvesting systems that meet the performance requirement that the systems are sized to use the amount of rain that falls on the roofs of such buildings during a one year, 24-hour storm event. A system that involves indoor uses of rainwater must be permitted by Seattle-King County Department of Health to qualify for the rate reduction. A system that relies solely on the capture and indoor use of rainwater shall qualify for the drainage service charge reduction only if the system is sized to meet the performance requirement stated above. Qualifying for the drainage service charge reduction does not relieve the property owner from the obligation to comply with applicable stormwater and drainage code requirements for the buildings and site.
2. Effective on the effective date of this ordinance, open space properties or parcels shall be charged only for the area of impervious surface and at the rate under which the parcel is classified using the total parcel acreage.

1. A drainage service charge is imposed on every parcel within the City, and the owner(s) thereof, except for the following exempted property(ies):

    1. The portion of a parcel that contains houseboats or piers that extend beyond the shoreline, as delineated by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data;
    2. That portion of a parcel that is submerged. If the parcel is entirely submerged, the entire parcel is exempt. If a portion of the parcel is submerged, only the submerged part will be exempt and the remainder of the parcel shall be billed as all other properties;
    3. City streets;
    4. State of Washington highways, so long as the State of Washington shall agree to maintain, construct and improve all drainage facilities associated with State highways as required by the Utility in conformance with all Utility standards for maintenance, construction and improvement hereafter established by the Utility and so far as such maintenance, construction and improvements shall be achieved at no cost to the Utility or to the City; and
    5. All other streets, so long as such streets provide drainage services in the same manner as City streets and the owner(s) shall agree to maintain, construct and improve all drainage facilities associated with such streets as required by the Utility in conformance with all Utility standards for maintenance, construction and improvement hereafter established by the Utility and so far as such maintenance, construction and improvements shall be achieved at no cost to the Utility or to the City.
    6. Effective January 1, 2013, that portion of a parcel containing a riparian corridor that contains highly infiltrative pervious surface and meeting all qualification criteria established by the Utility by Director's Rule under Section 3.32.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code. The Utility may consider Geographic Information System data and any other information determined necessary in identifying qualifying riparian corridors.
    7. Effective January 1, 2013, that portion of a parcel containing an island that contains highly infiltrative pervious surface and less than ten percent impervious surface area. The Utility may consider Geographic Information System data and any other information determined necessary in identifying qualifying islands.
    8. Effective upon the date set by Directors Rule, but no later than January 1, 2014, that portion of a parcel containing a wetland that meets all qualification criteria as established by the Utility by Director's Rule under Section 3.32.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code. The Director's Rule shall also establish administrative schedules and procedures for demonstrating initial and ongoing compliance with exemption criteria. For the 2014 billing year only, the Utility will accept applications and supporting exemption qualification documentation specified in the Director's Rule through May 15, 2014 as a basis for an adjustment to the 2014 drainage service charge for a particular parcel. Applications and supporting qualification documentation submitted after May 15, 2014 will be considered for future billing years under SMC 21.33.070.A. The Utility may consider Geographic Information System data and any other necessary information in identifying qualifying wetlands.
2. The drainage service charge shall be based upon a parcel's estimated contribution to City-wide surface and storm water runoff. A parcel's run-off is estimated based on its size and surface characteristics, including the amount and type of impervious and pervious surface it contains.
3. Drainage service charges shall be determined as follows:

    1. Small single-family residential properties shall be assigned to one of five flat rate categories based on a billable area. Within each category, properties will be charged a uniform annual drainage rate per parcel which is calculated based on an estimated average contribution of surface and storm water runoff for the category. The applicable drainage rate shall equal the drainage service charge.
    2. General service and large residential properties shall be assigned to a rate category based on the estimated percent of impervious surface contained within the parcel. For rate category assignment purposes, percent of impervious surface shall be based on the parcel's total non-submerged area for parcels qualifying for exemptions under subsections 21.33.030.A.6, 21.33.030.A.7, and 21.33.030.A.8. For rate class assignment for all other parcels, percent of impervious surface shall be based on the parcel's total billable area. Subsequently, properties assigned to the "undeveloped," "light," and "moderate" rate categories that also contain sufficient quantities of highly infiltrative pervious surface cover to meet Utility-defined performance requirements shall be assigned to a "low impact" rate category. A separate drainage rate shall apply to each general service and large residential rate category. The drainage service charge shall be calculated by multiplying the drainage rate, as determined by the parcel's rate category assignment, by the parcel's billable area (rounded to the nearest whole number of a square foot and divided by one thousand). For condominiums, the drainage service charge shall be determined for the entire parcel and then divided evenly among the owners. Present use code, site visits, planimetric maps based on aerial photography, and other information shall be used to estimate the percentage of impervious area.
4. Drainage rates used in the calculation of drainage service charges shall be the sum of the treatment rate and the system rate, as follows:

    1. Treatment rate. The "treatment rate" shall be the rate required to pay the drainage share of "treatment cost" which is the cost of wastewater treatment, interception, and disposal service, and any associated costs necessary to meet Drainage and Wastewater Fund policies. The treatment rate shall be the amount obtained when (a) the projected drainage treatment cost for each rate category is divided by (b) the projected number of billing units in each rate category and the result is multiplied by 118 percent to cover the costs of taxes, low income rate assistance, and other allowances. The projected treatment cost shall be the treatment cost anticipated for the upcoming calendar year, which may include an adjustment to reflect the difference, whether positive or negative, between the drainage share of expected total treatment cost for the current year and the total drainage service charge revenues attributable to the treatment rate expected for the current year. The treatment rate is designed to pass through cost changes driven by King County and may be adjusted by ordinance at any time in response to such charges.
    2. System rate. The "system rate" shall be the rate required to fund the expense associated with operating, maintaining, and constructing the City's surface and stormwater management system, including any share of combined sanitary and stormwater system expense assigned to drainage.
    3. The rate categories and the corresponding annual drainage rates are as follows:
5. Each bill shall be rounded to the nearest cent. The minimum annual drainage service charge shall be $5 per parcel.

#### 21.33.040 - Stormwater facility credit program

1. The Utility may apply a stormwater facility credit to be effective beginning January 1 of the 2009 billing year, in accordance with this Section 21.33.040, to reduce the annual drainage service charge for a particular parcel within the City if the stormwater originating from the parcel being billed is managed by one or more approved stormwater management facilities that are installed on the parcel being billed; or that are installed on a parcel different than the parcel being billed, subject to the following conditions:

    1. The applicant must be able to demonstrate that the approved stormwater management facility located on a different parcel is designed to manage the stormwater originating on the parcel being billed; and
    2. If the owner of the parcel being billed does not own the parcel on which the approved stormwater management facility is installed, the applicant must be able to provide adequate documentation confirming that the Utility will have the right to inspect the facility for the applicable purposes under subsection 21.33.040.C; and
    3. The approved stormwater management facility managing the stormwater from the parcel being billed must not be owned by the Utility, except where the applicant for the credit is the Utility.
2. Property owners must complete a stormwater facility credit application and submit it to the Utility by November 1st of any calendar year for credit against the subsequent year's drainage service charge. The stormwater facility credit will not be applied until the Utility has approved the application in writing.
3. Prior to approving a stormwater facility credit, and annually after a facility credit is approved, the Utility shall have the right to inspect the approved stormwater management facility(ies) and parcel being billed to confirm application information and continued eligibility for the credit. Inspection may include confirmation of parcel characteristics, such as impervious surface area, and determination that the facility meets the technical design requirements and is being inspected and maintained in accordance with Stormwater Code Chapters 22.800 through 22.808 and associated Director's Rules.
4. The Utility will calculate a stormwater facility credit for each eligible parcel that has applied for such credit based on the following:

    1. The type and size of the approved stormwater management facility(ies). The Utility will assign a uniform rate credit to each type of approved stormwater management facility based on a weighting of the stormwater performance goals the facility satisfies and that are applicable to the appropriate drainage discharge point for the parcel being billed;
    2. The percentage of impervious surface on the parcel that is managed by the approved stormwater management facility(ies); and
    3. The percentage of the parcel's drainage service charge which is based on runoff from impervious surfaces, as determined using flow calculation data for the applicable drainage service charge rate category.
5. To assign the uniform rate credit by facility type under Section 21.33.040.D.1 and calculate the stormwater facility credit only, the Utility will use the stormwater performance goals under the Stormwater, Grading and Drainage Code adopted by Ordinance No. 119965, effective July 5, 2000, for any approved stormwater management facility installed prior to July 5, 2000. The Utility will use the stormwater performance goals under the Stormwater Code in effect at the time the approved stormwater management facility is installed for any such facility installed after July 5, 2000.
6. The allowable maximum credit to the drainage service charge per parcel, including the stormwater facility credit and the reduction for rainwater harvesting systems under Section 21.33.030.D.4, may not exceed 50 percent of the drainage service charge for the parcel. The stormwater facility credit and reduction for rainwater harvesting systems may not reduce the drainage service charge per parcel below the minimum drainage service charge under Section 21.33.030.E.
7. The Utility may terminate the stormwater facility credit for any parcel, upon written notice, for the following reasons:

    1. The property owner does not maintain the approved stormwater management facility in a clean and properly functioning manner and does not take corrective action within the time specified by a Utility inspector;
    2. the parcel changes ownership;
    3. the parcel is re-developed or the parcel boundaries change.

#### 21.33.050 - Drainage service charges—Adjustments.

1. Any person receiving a drainage service charge may apply in writing to the Utility for a bill adjustment. Filing such a request does not extend the period for payment of the charge. Requests for adjustments on delinquent accounts will not be acted upon until paid in full.
2. A request for a bill adjustment may be based on one or more of the following:

    1. The billable area of the parcel is incorrect;
    2. The percent of impervious surface on a large residential or general service parcel places the parcel in a different rate category than the category assigned by the Utility;
    3. The parcel is a large residential or general service parcel which contains highly infiltrative pervious surface and meets all Utility requirements for low-impact rate category designation but has not been properly assigned to such a category by the Utility;
    4. The parcel meets the definition of exempted property and fulfills any qualification criteria established in SMC 21.33.030 or any Director's Rule referred to therein;
    5. The parcel is wholly or partially outside City of Seattle limits; or
    6. The parcel's stormwater facility credit was calculated with inaccurate data related to the parcel or to the approved stormwater management facility.
    7. The drainage service charge is otherwise erroneous in applying the terms of this chapter.
3. Applications for adjustments may be made to the Utility. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show that the adjustment sought should be granted. All decisions of the Utility shall be final.
4. Applications for adjustment must be filed within 90 days of the billing date, except for the low-income credit, which shall be administered as defined in Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.76.030. Applications received after 90 days of the billing date shall be effective for subsequent years only.
5. If the Utility grants an adjustment which reduces the charge for the current year, the applicant shall receive an adjusted bill or be refunded the amount overpaid. If the Utility determines that an adjustment should be made which increases the charge due for the current year, the applicant shall receive a supplemental bill that will be due within 45 days of the date of issue. Applicants for rate adjustments shall be notified in writing of the Utility's decision.

#### 21.33.060 - Billing included on property tax statements.

1. All parcels subject to a drainage service charge shall be billed annually based upon the rate category and square footage applicable to each such parcel as of November 1st of the year prior to the billing year.
2. The drainage service charge shall be displayed and billed on the annual King County property tax statement for the parcel and shall be mailed to the name and address shown on the real property tax roll at the time annual property bills are prepared. The drainage service charge billed on the annual King County property tax statement shall be net of any stormwater facility credit, that has been approved by December 1st of the calendar year prior to the applicable billing year. Stormwater facility credit applications that are received timely in accordance with Section 21.33.040.B, but not approved until after December 1, will receive credit within the applicable billing year.
3. If payment is received for a combined property tax and drainage service charge, the payment first shall be applied to the amount then due and payable (including delinquencies, if any) for the annual property tax on the parcel and then any remaining amount to the drainage service charge then due and payable (including delinquencies, if any); however, in the case of payment of a combined bill for property tax, drainage service charge and street utility charge, the provisions of SMC Chapter 21.101 shall apply.
4. The total amount of the drainage service charge shall be due and payable on or before the thirtieth day of April and shall be delinquent after that date; however, if one-half (½) of such drainage service charge is paid on or before the thirtieth day of April, the remainder shall be due and payable on or before the thirty-first day of October and shall be delinquent after that date.

If the customer elects to receive service from the Department's available distribution system voltage of four (4) kV or higher, metering will be at the distribution voltage level and the discounts for transformer losses, if applicable, and for transformer investment, if applicable, will be applied to the customer's billings. However, if the Department determines that it is either uneconomical or impractical to meter at the distribution voltage level, the Department will meter at the service voltage level and the discount for transformer losses will not be applicable.


1. Small general service is general service provided to customers who are not demand metered or, if demand metered, have had in the previous calendar year more than half of their normal billings at less than 50 kW of maximum demand. Classification of new customers as small general service customers will be based on the Department's estimate of maximum demand in the current year. Customers who are assigned flat rate bills shall be charged according to Small general service rates.
2. For customers metered on the primary side of a transformer, the Department will either program the meter to deduct computed transformer losses or provide a discount for transformer losses by reducing the monthly kWh billed by the number of kWh computed in Section 21.49.052 A.
3. For customers who provide their own transformation from the Department's standard distribution system voltage of four (4) kV, thirteen (13) kV, or twenty-six (26) kV to a utilization voltage, a discount for transformer investment will be provided in the amount stated in Section 21.49.052 A.
4. The Department will provide one (1) transformation from the available distribution system voltage of four (4) kV or higher to a standard service voltage, and metering normally will be at the service voltage level. However, if the Department determines that it is either uneconomical or impractical to meter at the service voltage level, the Department will meter at the distribution voltage level and will either program the meter to deduct computed transformer losses or will reduce the monthly kWh billed by the amount of the discount for transformer losses.

RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016:

The monthly charge for average monthly power factors below 0.97 shall be as follows:


0.15 cent per kVarh


1. When any inductive load causes unsatisfactory conditions on the Department's system due to induction, the Department may, at its discretion, install reactive kVA-hour meters and make a monthly charge in addition to demand and energy charges whenever electricity delivered to the customer has an average monthly power factor of less than 0.97.
2. Unless specifically otherwise agreed, the Department shall not be obligated to deliver electricity to the customer at any time at a power factor below 0.85.
3. The average power factor is determined as follows:

For application of the Power Factor Rate, the Average Power Factor calculated with this formula will not be rounded.

4. The meter for measurement of reactive kVA hours shall be ratcheted to prevent reverse registration.
5. All installations of power factor corrective equipment shall be subject to the approval of the Department. The customer's corrective equipment shall be switched with the load so that at no time will it supply leading reactive kVAs to the Department's distribution system unless written Department approval is obtained to do so.
6. This monthly charge may be waived in whole or in part to the extent that the Department determines that a power factor of less than 0.97 would be advantageous to the Department or if the addition of corrective equipment would be detrimental to the operation of the Department's distribution systems.
7. Customers who install new or enlarged arc furnaces shall install static VAR generators for flicker control and power factor correction for the entire arc furnace load. The generators shall have ½ cycle response time and independent phase control, supply sufficient reactive power to prevent objectionable flicker at the common connection point of the arc furnace with other utility customers, maintain a minimum power factor of 0.97, and be filtered to limit the total harmonic current to no more than the percentage of fundamental current given in "IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems, IEEE-519," latest revision.

#### 21.49.081 - Automatic BPA cost adjustment

Each time that BPA adjusts its rates that are applied to City Light through its then current power sales agreements (PSAs) and transmission service agreements (TSAs) with BPA, City Light will calculate the difference (in dollars) between what City Light would have paid for its BPA purchases under the previous BPA rates for a 12 month period beginning on the effective date of the BPA adjustment and what City Light will actually pay for the same period under the adjusted BPA rates. The dollar difference will then be multiplied by 1.1095, which is the effective tax rate, and the product divided by forecast load (in kWh) over the 12 month period to calculate a number (in dollars/kWh rounded to the nearest ten thousandth of a dollar) which will be called the "BPA increment."

For example, if an increase in BPA rates results in increased costs to the Department of $18,422,543 per year, this amount would be multiplied by the 1.1095 effective tax rate to get required additional customer revenue of $20,439,811. The additional revenue required would then be divided by the forecast kWh load to calculate the BPA increment.

As soon as practical after a BPA adjustment in rates, energy charges in effect under all rate schedules will be increased or decreased by the BPA increment, provided that for customers served under Schedules REC, RLC, RET, RLT, RES, RLS, REH, RLH, REB, RLB, REE, RLE, REL, and RLL, energy charges shall be increased or decreased by 40 percent of the BPA increment. The BPA increment will increase or decrease equally first block and second block charges in residential rates and peak and off-peak rates for large and high demand general service customers as well as the single energy charges for small and medium general service customers and the energy charge portion of Schedules T, L, P, R, A, and F.

If at any time after December 31, 2006, BPA announces an adjustment in the rates to be charged to City Light, then City Light shall compute the BPA increment for the purpose of ensuring that only the increase or decrease in costs from BPA will be passed through to City Light's customers. The increment will be based on the projected load for a 12 month period. City Light's rates shall be adjusted to give effect to the BPA increment, and the adjusted rates shall take effect after the effective date of the adjusted BPA rates as soon as the billing process can be implemented.


#### 21.49.082 - Net metering program

1. The Department shall offer a net metering program in accordance with Revised Code of Washington Chapter 80.60 and Chapter 21.49. The Department shall develop and enter into interconnection agreements, consistent with such laws, with customers desiring to participate in the net metering program. Customers are required to enter into interconnection agreements and to comply with their terms as a condition of participation in the net metering program. The Department is authorized to establish policies, procedures, and interconnection standards for implementing the net metering program.
2. The net metering program shall be available to customers that have net metering systems on a first come, first served basis until such time as the cumulative capacity of such systems equals 10 megawatts 0.5 percent of the Department's peak demand during 1996); provided that not less than one-half of this capacity shall be reserved for the cumulative generating capacity attributed to net metering systems that generate renewable energy; and provided further that the net metering program shall not be available to customers served by an underground distribution network, unless safety concerns can be adequately addressed. On January 1, 2014, the cumulative generating capacity available to net metering systems will equal 20 megawatts (1.0 percent of the Department's peak demand during 1996).
3. The Department may adopt additional safety, power quality, and interconnection requirements for customer-generators, including limitations on the number of customer generators and total capacity of net metering systems that may be interconnected to any distribution feeder line, circuit, or network, that the Department determines are necessary to protect public safety and system reliability.
4. Net metering program customers shall be metered, billed and credited as follows:

    1. In accordance with its normal metering practices, the Department shall measure the net electricity produced or consumed by each net metering program customer during the billing period applicable to that net metering program customer's rate schedule for electric service.
    2. If the electricity supplied to a net metering program customer by the Department exceeds the electricity generated by that customer and fed back to the Department during the billing period, that customer shall be billed in accordance with its then-current rate schedule for the net electricity supplied by the Department. If electricity generated by a net metering program customer and fed back to the Department exceeds the electricity supplied by the Department during a billing period, that net metering program customer shall be billed for all charges (including any minimum charges or base service charges) applicable to that customer's rate schedule, and shall be credited for the excess kilowatt-hours generated and fed back to the Department. A kilowatt-hour credit shall appear on the bill for the following billing period, shall be applied only to reduce the metered amount of kilowatt-hours billed by the Department to that customer, and any unused credit shall be carried forward to the next bill. On April 30 of each calendar year, any unused kilowatt-hour credit accumulated during the previous year shall be granted to the Department, without any compensation to the net metering program customer.
5. If a customer-generator requests, the Department shall provide meter aggregation.

    1. Kilowatt-hour credits earned by a net metering system, during the same billing period, shall be credited equally by the Department to remaining meters located on all premises of a customer-generator at the designated rate of each meter.
    2. Not more than a total of one hundred kilowatts shall be aggregated among all customer-generators participating in a generating facility under this subsection.

#### 21.49.084 - Voluntary Green Power, Green-Up Program.

The Department shall offer a Voluntary Green Power, Green-Up Program, in accordance with RCW Chapter 19.29A.


1. The Green-Up Program shall be voluntary and shall be available to all customers beginning July 1, 2005. Customers may voluntarily begin or terminate their participation at any time on or after July 1, 2005 by notifying the Department of their choice.
2. The Green-Up Program shall allow each customer to designate a voluntary green power payment level which, at the customer's discretion, may be added to the customer's monthly or bimonthly electricity bill or paid one time in full.
3. The voluntary Green-up Program payments, less the costs of program administration, marketing, and renewable energy education, ("Net Green-Up Revenue"), will be used to purchase qualified alternative energy resources. Subject to the provisions of the ordinances authorizing issuance of the City's municipal light and power revenue obligations, the Department shall make available from its budgeted funds, for the purchase or development of new qualified alternative energy resources, an amount equal to the Net Green-up Revenue allocated to existing Department qualified alternative energy resources.

Such customers shall pay a reserved distribution capacity charge.
2. The acceptance and continued implementation of a customer's request for reserved distribution capacity shall always be contingent on the Department's sole determination that adequate distribution capacity is available.

#### 21.49.086 - Rate Stabilization Account

The target size of the Rate Stabilization Account shall be no less than $100 million and no greater than $125 million.

Initial funding of the Rate Stabilization Account will come from a variety of sources including:


1. the amount remaining in City Light's existing Contingency Reserve Account;
2. cash from operations in 2010 in excess of that required for operations and debt service;
3. revenue from the sale of surplus property in 2010 and 2011 not already recognized in City Light's 2010 Adopted Budget;
4. allowable savings in 2010, 2011, and 2012 from refunding bonds in 2010; and
5. other sources of revenue as determined by the City Council.
For the purpose of this Ordinance, Net Wholesale Revenue means gross wholesale revenue less the amount of wholesale purchases.

The Net Wholesale Revenue forecast shall be $65 million for 2015 and $60 million for 2016.

The forecast thus established shall be the amount of Net Wholesale Revenue assumed by the City Council for the purpose of establishing City Light rates and budgets. The City Council will determine Net Wholesale Revenue forecasts for subsequent years prior to adopting City Light rates for those years.

The annual forecast for each year will be distributed over the quarters of the year as follows:


30% for January 1 to March 31;

35% for April 1 to June 30;

15% for July 1 to September 30; and

20% for October 1 to December 31.

The amounts determined in this way will be the quarterly Net Wholesale Revenue forecasts for the purpose of Subsection E and will be reported by City Light in its annual budget proposals.

Effective January 1, 2011; should the actual Net Wholesale Revenue for any quarter be less than the forecast for that quarter as determined in Subsection D, City Light will transfer the difference, rounded to the nearest million dollars, from the Rate Stabilization Account to the Light Fund. Alternatively, should the actual Net Wholesale Revenue for any quarter be greater than the forecast for that quarter as determined in Subsection D, City Light will transfer the difference, rounded to the nearest million dollars, from the Light Fund to the Rate Stabilization Account. In each case the transfer will occur within thirty days of the end of the quarter in question.

No later than thirty days after the end of each quarter, City Light will notify the Mayor and the City Council of the forecast and actual Net Wholesale Revenue for that quarter and for the year to date, and of the amount remaining in the Rate Stabilization Account after transfers authorized under this Subsection.

City Light will notify the Mayor and the Council in writing of its intent to impose a surcharge under either of these provisions.


1. Effective after the fund has reached its minimum target value of $100 million; If, in spite of the rate surcharges provided for in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this Subsection, the amount in the Rate Stabilization Account is $50 million or less, the City Council will initiate a rate review, if the Mayor has not already done so, within forty-five days that will increase rates, reduce City Light spending, or identify additional sources of funding, or a combination of these measures, to bring the amount in the Account up to $100 million within a period of 12 or fewer months.
Interest earned by the funds in the Rate Stabilization Account will be deposited into that account.

Nothing herein shall limit the authority of the City to deposit other amounts into the Rate Stabilization Account as may be authorized by ordinance.

Effective January 1, 2016; whenever the amount in the Rate Stabilization Account exceeds $125 million, the City Council will initiate a rate review, if the Mayor has not already done so, within forty-five days that will decrease rates, allow City Light to cover more of its capital expenditures with cash from operations or defease outstanding debt in order to keep future rates low, increase its expenditures, or a combination of these measures, to bring the amount in the Account down to $125 million within a period of 12 or fewer months.


1. A The purpose of the Rate Stabilization Account established by Ordinance 121637 is, among other things, to absorb fluctuations in City Light's annual revenue in any given year due to deviations in net wholesale revenue from the amount assumed in the adopted budget for that year. Deposits into and withdrawals from the Rate Stabilization Account also affect the calculation of "Net Revenue" under certain provisions of ordinances authorizing City Light bonds, and can therefore serve to absorb other fluctuations in "Net Revenue" as that term is defined in those bond ordinances. Except as otherwise provided by ordinance, funds in the Rate Stabilization Account cannot be used for any purposes other than those specified herein.
2. Target size of the Rate Stabilization Account:
3. Initial funding of the Rate Stabilization Account:
4. Baseline for the Net Wholesale Revenue forecast:
5. Use of the Rate Stabilization Account:
6. Replenishment of the Rate Stabilization Account:

    1. Whenever the amount in the Rate Stabilization Account is $90 million or less, City Light will impose a surcharge equal to 1.5% of base rates at the earliest opportunity. The proceeds from the surcharge will be deposited into the Rate Stabilization Account. The surcharge will remain in effect until the amount in the Rate Stabilization Account reaches $100 million and will be removed at the earliest opportunity thereafter.
    2. Whenever the amount in the Rate Stabilization Account is $80 million or less, City Light will impose an additional surcharge equal to 1.5% of base rates at the earliest opportunity. The proceeds of the additional surcharge will be deposited into the Rate Stabilization Account. The additional surcharge will remain in effect until the amount in the Rate Stabilization Account reaches $90 million, and will be removed at the earliest opportunity thereafter.
    3. Whenever the amount in the Rate Stabilization Account is $70 million or less, City Light will impose an additional surcharge equal to 1.5% of base rates at the earliest opportunity. The proceeds of the additional surcharge will be deposited into the Rate Stabilization Account. The additional surcharge will remain in effect until the amount in the Rate Stabilization Account reaches $80 million, and will be removed at the earliest opportunity thereafter.
7. Disposition of excess funds in the Rate Stabilization Account:
8. Consistent with Section 22 of Ordinance 121637, deposits into or withdrawals from the Rate Stabilization Account in respect of any fiscal year may be made up to and including the date ninety (90) days after the end of that fiscal year.

#### 21.49.087 - Community Solar Program

1. The Community Solar Program allows customers to receive credits based on energy production from a solar photovoltaic (PV) array owned and managed by Seattle City Light.
2. The Community Solar Program may be offered on a voluntary basis beginning in 2011. All Seattle City Light customers are eligible to participate, subject to limited space availability. Interested customers will initiate their participation with a voluntary one-time upfront payment and signed participant contract.
3. Each participating customer will receive an energy credit for each kWh produced by their portion of their assigned solar PV array, to be distributed annually as specified in a standard participant contract developed by the Department.
4. The credit for kWh produced by community solar PV arrays shall be equal to Seattle City Light's small general service energy charge for the City of Seattle (Schedule SMC) for all community solar participants, regardless of the rate schedule they fall under themselves.
5. Each participating customer will also receive annual renewable energy production incentive payments in accordance with RCW 82.16.110, as available through June, 2020.
6. The first community solar array owned by Seattle City Light will initially be funded by a Department of Energy grant of $300,000. The voluntary Community Solar Program payments (enrollment fees) will replace some or all of the grant funding, and will be used to finance additional arrays in the same manner.
7. Seattle City Light has the right to terminate enrollment of new customers into the program at any time, but will meet obligations to participating customers through the term of their contracts.
8. Terms and conditions of the program will be developed by City Light and made available to program participants prior to their enrollment.

#### 21.49.088 - Automatic utility tax for municipalities outside The City of Seattle

1. Should a municipality outside The City of Seattle decide to levy a utility tax on the Department for revenues derived by the Department from customers within that municipality, then the Department will implement that tax in accordance with state law.
2. Upon receiving notice that the municipality has decided to levy a utility tax, the Department may adjust the rate schedules and bills of customers in that municipality to collect that tax in full.
3. The Department has the discretion to implement the utility tax as a standalone line item on the customer bill, or by incorporating the effective tax rate into rates for customers in that municipality.

#### 21.49.090 - Rate, meter reading, and billing provisions.

1. Prohibition of Departures from Adopted Rates and Rate Discrimination. The Department shall have no authority, by express contract or otherwise, to change or vary the schedule of rates and charges established by ordinance or to act in any way that would violate RCW 80.28.080. It shall be the responsibility of the Department to collect any undercharge, whether intentionally or inadvertently made, to prevent preferential treatment in violation of RCW 80.28.090 or rate discrimination in violation of RCW 80.28.100.
2. Single Meter, Single Service. All rates in this chapter apply to electricity supplied through a single meter to individual customers at each building or premises not separated by intervening property, streets, or alleys commonly used as public thoroughfares. At the option of the Department, however, two (2) or more physically and mechanically connected buildings used for a single business function under one (1) ownership may be supplied through one (1) point of delivery and one (1) meter even though they are separated by intervening property or a street or alley. Two (2) buildings merely joined by a walkway or mall across the street, alley, or public thoroughfare will not be allowed a single service and meter for both. In the event two (2) or more premises under one (1) ownership that are physically and mechanically connected, used for a single business function, and supplied through one (1) point of delivery and one (1) meter, undergo a change in ownership, so that each premises is separately owned, each premises will require a single service pursuant to this chapter. Each building owner(s) will be responsible for the conversion to a single meter at its sole expense. Such conversion will be subject to the installation charges set out in Section 21.49.110 T. Exceptions to the requirement for single meter, single service may be provided through the Department's authority granted in Section 21.49.130. No exception shall be granted for services with demand greater than that defined under Section 21.49.052.
3. Added Service. At the discretion of the Department, any additional service supplied to the same customer in the same structure at different voltage or phase shall be separately metered and billed, and the customer shall pay for the installation of the service.
4. Totalizing Multiple Meters. The Department may waive the application of rates to each meter and permit the reading of two (2) or more meters at a single contiguous location to be totaled for billing purposes when the premises are billed for electric service under large general service or high demand general service rate schedules, as defined in SMC 21.49.057 and 21.49.058, and the Department determines that the maintenance of adequate service and/or that the Department's convenience requires more than one (1) meter for each type of service or load classification.
5. Single Meter, Multiple Units: Owner/Tenant Billing. An account with one (1) meter serving more than one (1) unit will be billed to the property owner at City Light's option. When such services are identified, the Department will place the account in the owner's name effective the date of identification, unless the Department determines that another date would be more appropriate. It is the responsibility of the owner/manager to give City Light written notice that the account premises has a split load (i.e., one (1) meter serves multiple units). Any terms and conditions contained in a lease or rental agreement for payment of electric services are not binding on the Department. In the event there is a dispute relating to such lease or rental agreement, the owner/manager shall be responsible for the timely payment for the electric service provided to the account premises. Failure to make such payments shall result in immediate termination of such service.
6. Rate Schedule Switching. No more than one (1) change to or from a rate schedule shall be made by the same customer during a twelve (12) month period unless the nature of the customer's electrical equipment or use of electricity changes.
7. Demand Intervals. Billing demand shall be the highest recorded demand (expressed in kW) during any fifteen (15) minute interval of the billing period, as determined at the Department's option by demand meter with either a fixed or sliding fifteen (15) minute interval, periodic load test, or assessment.
8. Seasonal Proration. All seasonal rates shall be prorated.
9. Meter Records; Estimated Meter Reads. Meters shall be read and bills rendered either monthly or bimonthly as scheduled by the Department. A record of meter readings will be kept by the Department, and the records shall be the basis for determination of bills rendered for metered service. It shall be the customer's responsibility to notify the Department of the date the customer began using the electric service. If the customer fails to notify the Department, the Department shall designate a date for billing purposes. If an accurate meter reading is not obtained for any reason, including, but not limited to, the customer's failure to notify the Department, meter failure, meter reading error, clerical error and/or accounting system malfunction, the meter reading may be estimated by the Department. In estimating meter reading (electrical consumption) it is not necessary that the estimate be made with mathematical certainty. In developing an estimate the Department shall use standard engineering practices, which may include but are not limited to regression analysis, customer loads, load comparison, meter conditions and test readings. In cases where estimates cannot be made using standard engineering techniques, the longest periods before and/or after the period of usage may be averaged to arrive at an estimated rate of consumption. In the event a constant margin of error is identified the bill may be adjusted accordingly.
10. Prorating Nonstandard Meter Reads. The rate schedules in this chapter indicate the charges for one (1) month's service. If usage is billed for longer or shorter intervals than normal billing periods, customer bills will be prorated. For purposes of applying demand charges in general service rate schedules, twenty-eight (28) to thirty-five (35) days shall be considered a normal billing period. Energy charges in residential rate schedules and minimum charges and base service charges in all rate schedules are prorated on a daily basis. For these charges, thirty (30) days shall be considered a normal monthly billing period.
11. Billings When the Meter Malfunctions. If the Department's seal on a meter, meter enclosure, current transformer enclosure, current limiter enclosure, or a terminal box is broken, or if for any reason as determined by the Department a meter does not properly register the electricity used, the customer shall be charged for usage, estimated by the Department pursuant to subsection I of this section above and billed accordingly.
12. When Service Is Interrupted. If the operation of the Department's generating, transmission, or distribution system is suspended, interrupted, or interfered with for any cause including but not limited to suspension or interruption due to planned or unplanned maintenance, Department equipment failure, suspension, interruption, or interference due to droughts, lightning and rain storms, wind storms, floods, fires, strikes, earthquakes, accidents, acts of God, the public enemy, war, governmental regulations, orders or proclamations, laws, mobs, riots, and transportation difficulties, the Department need not deliver electricity and the customer need not accept or pay for electric service for such period of time and to the extent that the suspension, interruption, or interference makes it reasonably impractical to deliver or use electricity. If the operation of the customer's work, plant or establishment is suspended, interrupted or interfered with for any cause reasonably beyond the customer's control, including but not limited to suspension or interruption due to droughts, floods, fires, strikes, accidents, acts of God, the public enemy, war, governmental regulations, orders or proclamations, laws, mobs, riots and transportation difficulties, the customer need not accept or pay for electric service for such period of time and to the extent that the suspension, interruption or interference makes it reasonably impractical to use electricity. Bills for any period including any suspension, interruption, or interference of departmental systems or customer plant or establishment, as described above, shall be prorated exclusive of minimum charges. Within one (1) week of any interruption, suspension, or interference the customer shall give written notice to the Department to read meters in order to make it possible to prorate billings.
13. Special Minimum Charges. A minimum monthly charge other than that specified under a particular rate schedule may be established by the Department to protect the Department's investment and to recover the fixed operating cost associated with providing an electric service.
14. Average Payment Plan. Pursuant to the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02) the Department shall establish an average payment plan whereby a residential customer's expected billings for the next year may be averaged throughout the year in equal installments which normally shall be adjusted no more than once per calendar year. The Department, however, may adjust the payment level during the year to account for certain exigent circumstances, such as a rate change or a customer's deficit exceeding a certain level. The average payment plan shall be made available upon request to any residential customer of the Department who has established a twelve (12) month billing history on his or her current account, or on the basis of an estimate of consumption satisfactory to the Department. The average payment plan, however, shall cease to be available one (1) year from the date of enrollment in the average payment plan to those residential customers who own their dwelling unit and who use electric heat as defined in Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.52.210 (Ordinance 109675, Section 2) but who have not completed or who are not in the process of completing the energy conservation measures required for participation in the Comprehensive Residential Weatherization Program described in Seattle Municipal Code Section 21.52.260 (Ordinance 109675, Section 8) as of that date.
15. Overdue Bills and Disconnection. All charges shall become payable by the due date shown on individual bills. If the charges are not paid, service may be disconnected following reasonable and appropriate notice to the customer by the Department.

#### 21.49.100 - Application and contract provisions

In cases where the customer is a tenant, the property owner or his agent must provide notice to the Department of the dates a tenant starts and ends occupancy or has control of the premises. Such notices must be made within ten (10) working days of the start and end dates. Failure of a property owner to provide such notice may result in billing charges to the property owner for a tenant's use of electric service. The receipt and acceptance of a payment of a periodic billing by the Department does not constitute payment in full for electric service unless it reflects the actual amount of service provided. In the event the bill reflects an amount that is less than the amount of electric service provided, the customer shall be liable for such difference. The customer is liable for all services rendered at the published rate and failure of the utility to bill does not release the customer from such liability. The open and continuing contract remains in effect until terminated by the customer or the Department and the customer will be required to pay any unbilled or underbilled service costs that are billed or rebilled within six (6) years of the date of termination. In the event that a customer uses the electric service provided by the Department but fails to receive billing for service, it shall be the customer's responsibility to notify the Department of the failure to receive a bill. It shall be the customer's responsibility to notify the Department in writing within sixty (60) days from the billing date, if a customer receives a bill on which the customer believes that the wrong rate schedule has been applied or that any other defect in billing exists. The Department assumes no responsibility for retroactive adjustments prior to the bill for which the Department has been provided such written notice.


1. Sole Provider. In order to ensure safety and system integrity, the customer shall be required to purchase all electricity from the Department or from sources approved by the Department.
2. Service Contracts and Agreements: Customers' Obligations. Applicants or customers desiring electric service shall make application to and may be required to sign an application furnished by the Department before service is supplied. Failure to notify the Department of use of service or to sign a contract when requested shall constitute sufficient cause for the Department to disconnect or refuse to provide electric service. Upon acceptance by the Department, the application shall constitute a contract between the Department and the applicant by which the Department agrees to furnish and the applicant agrees to accept and pay for electric service for the premises specified under the rates, terms, and provisions prescribed from time to time by ordinance. In the absence of an application for service or signed contract, the furnishing of electric service by the Department and the use of such service by the customer shall constitute a contract and the customer agrees to pay for such electric service under the rates, terms and provisions of the applicable rate ordinance as amended from time to time. The acceptance of application for service by the Department or the use by the customer of electric service provided by the Department will constitute an open and continuous contract for electric services between the Department and the customer.
3. Department's Obligation to Serve; Customers' Obligation to Pay. The Department, within its capabilities and under the rates, terms, and provisions of applicable City ordinances, shall supply electric service to all customers upon approval of application for electric service. The customer shall be responsible for all charges under the conditions of the contract and the rates and terms prescribed by ordinance or written Department rules and regulations, and shall be responsible for all charges to the time specified in the application or for the period of occupancy and/or control of the premises. Notice to close an account or disconnect service to any premises shall be given by the customer at any business office of the Department. If the customer fails to close an account, the customer will be responsible up to the date the Department closes the account. If the customer does not give prior written notice to the Department to close an account or disconnect service to a premises on a certain date, the Department may bill the customer to a closing date determined by the Department, unless the customer is able to substantiate to the Department's satisfaction that the customer terminated the use of the Department's electric service at an earlier date. In cases where the customer is a tenant, and the property owner fails to give notice to the Department pursuant to subsection B, the owner may be charged for a tenant's use of electric service. If a tenant properly closes an account and is no longer occupying the space, the closing date will not change regardless of any owner/tenant lease agreement.
4. Joint Accounts and Guarantors. Where more than one (1) person (joint account or guarantor) is named on an electric account, both parties shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the electric bill incurred on that account. It shall be the responsibility of a party named on the account to pay in full any existing bill prior to removal of that person's name from that electric service account. In the event a person (husband, wife, roommate, partner, etc.) is residing at a premises receiving electric service from the Department, that person will be presumed to have used the electric service and will be equally responsible for payment of the electric service bills accumulated during the period of residency. It shall be the responsibility of the person denying responsibility to prove to the satisfaction of the Department that he/she was living elsewhere during the billing period. Such acceptable proofs shall be a combination of the following documents: a properly executed lease or rental agreement, and utility bills (water, telephone, gas) for the time period in question and in the name of the person seeking to avoid responsibility.
5. Condominium Disconnections. The Department shall not disconnect service to a customer at the request of a Condominium Association for the purpose of implementing RCW 64.32.200(1), the Horizontal Property Regimes Act. In the event a facility is operated as a condominium association pursuant to the Horizontal Property Regimes Act (RCW Chapter 64.32) all units will be separately metered.

It shall be the condominium association's responsibility to provide, at its sole cost, the

necessary entrance service and meter bases required by this chapter and the Department's Service Requirements.

6. Contract Violations. If a customer violates the contract with the Department or orders the closure of an account or service disconnect to any premises, the customer shall be responsible for all loss or damage incurred by the City by reason thereof.
7. Prohibition of Submetering. The customer shall not install or use equipment or devices to submeter electricity for the purpose of reselling or otherwise apportioning the costs of electric energy usage except as provided for in Section 21.49.100 H.
8. Prohibition of Submetering: Exceptions. The Department shall not provide electricity to any customer who submeters any part of the electricity for the purpose of resale or apportionment or who otherwise apportions the costs of electric energy use to any other consumer, except that the Department shall permit such resale or apportionment for the following purposes:

    1. Boat Mooring Establishments. New or upgraded service to boat mooring establishments shall be master metered. The Department will not provide meters for individual moorage spaces nor directly bill individual boat moorage tenants at a boat moorage establishment where a new service has been installed or an existing service has been upgraded after September 25, 1982.

    Resale by customer operators shall be at an average rate not to exceed the operator's average cost per kWh as billed by the Department and shall not exceed the proportion of the costs for which the boat moorage tenant is responsible.

    2. Mobile Home Parks. This exception applies to only those mobile home park operators submetering and reselling electricity as of August 1, 1980. New or upgraded services to mobile home parks will be provided in accordance with written Department rules and regulations.

    Resale by customer operators shall be at an average rate not to exceed the operator's average cost per kWh as billed by the Department and shall not exceed the proportion of the costs for which the mobile home park tenant is responsible.

    3. Other Purposes. On a case-by-case basis, the Department may permit a customer, subject to the provisions of Section 21.49.110 J, to submeter for the purpose of apportioning the cost of electric energy; provided, however, such determination must be based on an objective review and must relate to an economic imbalance relating to service and/or protection of each customer's rights under this chapter and RCW 80.28.

    Resale by customer operators shall be at an average rate not to exceed the operator's average cost per kWh as billed by the Department and shall not exceed the proportion of the costs for which the tenant is responsible.

    Submetering permitted under this Subsection H shall:

    All records shall be maintained in accordance with State regulations, and open to inspection and audit. On request, at no charge to the tenant, the customer operator shall provide accuracy tests traceable to NIST.

    The Department shall charge the customer operator for all costs resulting from confirming compliance with the above requirements and investigating or correcting impermissible submetering.


        1. Be a permanent installation compliant with the National Electric Code (NEC), as well as State and local codes;
        2. Be inspected and approved by the authority having jurisdiction;
        3. Be listed for the purpose by a recognized testing laboratory;
        4. Be compliant with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) C12.20 0.5 Accuracy Class;
        5. Have records showing accuracy tests traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); and
        6. Have maintenance records for the life of the equipment.
9. Applicant and Customer Deposits. Applicants and customers may be required by the Department to deposit an amount of money to be held as security for payment of all bills and claims during the period of service. The Department may refuse to connect an applicant's service for failure to pay a deposit when requested, and may disconnect a customer's service for failure to pay a deposit when requested. The deposits may be required upon the Department's determination that the financial status or record of the applicant or customer warrants a deposit. Such deposit may not exceed the amount of the bill it is estimated will accrue during two (2) typical billing periods. Upon termination of service, or after twelve (12) billing periods if the customer's credit warrants, the deposits, less any amount owed by the customer, may be returned to the customer. When the deposit is returned, interest will be paid at the rate of six (6) percent per annum on a deposit held longer than six (6) months. Interest payable shall be computed from the first day of the month following the date of deposit to the last day of the month the deposit is refunded.
10. Vacant Premises. Property owners shall be responsible for electricity used when the premises are vacant. Owners of leased or rented premises shall be responsible for electricity used by the premises until the Department is notified to open an account for a tenant. Owners shall be responsible for electricity used by the vacant premises whether the account is in the name of the owner or a tenant.
11. Account Service Charge. An applicant or a customer shall be charged an account service charge for establishing an account. The charge shall be included in the initial billing to the first permanent occupant after the establishment of an account. The schedule of charges shall be established through the Administrative Code process. The account service charge shall not apply in the following cases:

    1. For a name, address, or rate schedule change involving the same premises and account, or the addition of names to existing accounts;
    2. For temporary service used for the purpose of new construction;
    3. For meters or other charges added to an existing account;
    4. For customers billed on Schedules REC, RES, RET, REH, REB, RLT, RLC, RLS, RLH, RLB, REE, RLE, REL, and RLL;
    5. For the transfer of responsibility for an existing account for service to an existing premises from the occupant of record to another party, and the assumption by that other party of the obligation to pay for the service, when no opening or closing of the account is involved;
    6. For billing of vacancy current to property owners or authorized agent;
    7. For a change in status between vacant and occupied.
12. Authority to Surcharge. During periods of system energy deficiencies, the Department may bill and the customer may be required to pay any additional charges and/or surcharges necessary to recover the cost of electricity acquired for the purpose of eliminating the system energy deficiency; the additional charges and/or surcharges may be imposed on all electric services whether rendered or to be rendered during the period of energy deficiency; provided, that no charges and/or surcharges will be billed, nor will the customer be required to pay them, until the charges and/or surcharges have been authorized by ordinance.

#### 21.49.110 - Electric service connection provisions

The Department shall also apply the following specific criteria in developing, reviewing, and adopting all efficiency standards:


In adopting any new or amended efficiency standards after August 1, 1984, the Department may consider including the following requirements:

In the development of each efficiency standard the Department shall solicit technical assistance from the customer class affected by the standard. In addition, the Department shall periodically review and evaluate all efficiency standards designated pursuant to this chapter and shall revise them as necessary to reflect the changing needs of the Department's generation, transmission, and distribution systems.


1. Efficiency standards must be cost effective. An efficiency standard shall be considered cost effective if the life cycle costs of complying with the standard are below the incremental system costs of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity from the least-cost alternative new source of supply.
2. Efficiency standards must apply equitably to all customers in a customer class.
3. Efficiency standards must be no more stringent than the City's requirements for new construction.
4. A requirement that an electric energy analysis be performed;
5. A requirement that the customer implement the electric energy analysis recommendations;
6. A requirement that the size of service be limited to that required to serve the intended use of electricity in order to prevent oversizing the service;
7. A requirement that a customer provide the Department with advance notice of any request for a new or enlarged service connection.

1. Rule-making Authority. The Department shall have the authority to adopt and enforce rules and regulations, consistent with this chapter and the provisions of the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02, Ordinance 102228, as amended), for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter governing availability of service and materials from the Department. Notwithstanding the repeal of Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 21.48 (Ordinance 109218, as amended), all existing rules and regulations adopted by the Department shall remain in effect until modified or revoked.
2. Confirmation of Meters. In buildings with multiple accounts, it shall be the responsibility of each customer (whether building owner, tenant, or agent) to confirm the number of meters installed at the customer's premises and check all meter numbers with the meter numbers on the electric service bill. It is the customer's responsibility to notify the Department in writing within sixty (60) days of any discrepancy in meter numbers. The Department will assume no responsibility for retroactive adjustments due to incorrect meter number where such timely notice has not been received.

It shall be the responsibility of owners of buildings with multiple accounts, or their agents, to assure that all electric meters are connected to the appropriate apartment, housing unit, or business establishment. Apartments or dwelling unit addresses, including apartment numbers, shall not be changed or reordered without notifying the Department in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to such change or reordering. In the event apartment or dwelling unit numbers or addresses are changed or reordered, the owner or the owner's agent shall notify the Department thirty (30) days in advance of any such change. The Department may visit the site to verify such changes and confirm that each apartment or dwelling unit is connected to the proper meter. For such meter check by the Department, the building owner shall be billed the actual cost required to perform such meter check.

3. Service Entrance Requirements. On initial installations or modifications to initial installations, the customer shall provide service entrance equipment which meets applicable Seattle and King County electrical codes and the Department's written rules and regulations. In the event a customer's electric service was installed before Seattle or King County enacted the current electrical code the customer may not be required by the electrical code to upgrade his/her service. It shall be the responsibility of the owner/customer to determine if changes to the electrical system are necessary to receive the safety benefits of the new or amended electrical codes and the National Electrical Code. It shall be a violation of this chapter to connect a building's electrical wiring to the Department's electrical system if the wiring of the building was not authorized by a proper City or county permit, does not meet the applicable existing electrical codes or was not inspected by the proper authority.
4. Authority and Responsibility for System Design and Construction. The design and construction of the Department's transmission and distribution system shall be within the sole discretion of the Department; such design and construction shall consider public and employee safety, system efficiency, system uniformity, and the economic impact of such design and construction on electric rates. In the event a customer wants any system (distribution) change for its own convenience or for aesthetics, the utility may at its sole discretion make such system change or modification, provided that the customer shall pay, in advance of construction, the estimated cost of time and materials and the final actual cost when the construction is completed.
5. Prohibition of Master Metering. The Department shall not supply electricity for any new service to a duplex or multiple-dwelling building for the purpose of master metering the energy usage of the dwelling units, a central space heating system or HVAC system, or a central domestic water heating system. The Department shall not supply electricity for any larger service to an existing duplex or multiple-dwelling building for the purpose of master metering new central or individual space heating or HVAC systems. The existence of alternative laundry or dining arrangements for residents of multiple-dwelling buildings (such as central kitchens and dining rooms where residents can buy or eat their meals, or a central laundry), in addition to the availability of cooking and/or laundry facilities within the individual dwelling units, will not be considered grounds for an exemption from the prohibition of master metering.

This prohibition does not apply to multiple-dwelling buildings such as transitional housing, student dormitories and residences for religious orders, the elderly or the disabled, in which the residents do not live independently.

In situations with a mix of living accommodations where some residents live independently and some do not, those buildings or portions of buildings which provide non-transient independent dwelling units will not be eligible for master metering.

Accessory Housing Exception. An owner occupied dwelling unit also containing an additional "accessory housing unit" meeting all provisions as defined in Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 23.44 and approved by The City of Seattle shall be exempt from the master metering provisions of this chapter.

Other Exceptions: Exemption from the master metering prohibition for residential dwelling situations not covered in the provisions of this chapter may be granted on a case-by-case basis by the Department.

6. Efficiency Standards. Pursuant to the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02, Ordinance 102228, as amended) the Department shall adopt rules and regulations to promote conservation of The City of Seattle's electric energy resources by the designation of end-use efficiency standards to limit energy waste from all new or enlarged electric service connections. The Department may also designate end-use efficiency standards to limit energy waste from conversions to electric space heat at existing electric service connections. For the purpose of this section, "end-use" shall be defined as the final conversion of electric energy on the customer's premises into lighting, heating, cooling, and/or other mechanical processes.

The Department may require compliance with the rules and regulations as a condition for the supply or continued supply of electric service.

Pursuant to the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02, Ordinance 102228, as amended) the Department shall:


    1. Give notice of any public hearings held on proposed efficiency standards;
    2. Afford all interested persons an opportunity to present data, views or arguments in regard to proposed efficiency standards;
    3. Give appropriate consideration to economic values, along with any environmental, social, health, and safety factors affecting proposed efficiency standards.
7. Protective Devices. The Department may require customers to provide on their premises, at their own expense, additional protective devices deemed necessary by the Department to protect the Department's property or personnel, or the property or personnel of the Department's other customers. However, failure to require such protective devices does not relieve the customer of its responsibility to provide the necessary protective devices to protect itself, its property and/or equipment from electrical transients, surges and/or loss of power.

It is the responsibility of customers using sensitive electronic equipment, computers, and computer peripheral equipment to provide, at their own expense, all protective devices necessary to protect such equipment against electro-magnetic fields, natural and switching transients, power surges, planned power outages, emergency power outages and any other occurrence which occurs on the Department's electrical system that is not within the control of the Department or is due to the natural mechanical failure of any of the equipment utilized to support and operate the Department's electrical system. It is also the customer's responsibility to provide the necessary emergency backup electrical system sufficient to protect the customer's sensitive electronic equipment and provide emergency electrical power as necessary to operate essential personal, business and medical equipment.

8. Three (3) Phase Motors: Protective Devices. Customers shall have the responsibility to provide suitable devices adequate to protect their three (3) phase motors and other equipment against reversal of phase rotation and single phasing.
9. Devices to Control Quality of Energy. Where the customer's use of electrical equipment results in an interference with the quality of the customer's own service or that of neighboring customers, or where the customer requires voltage control within unusually close limits, the Department may require the customer to provide at the customer's own expense such special or additional equipment as is required. This may apply to cases of extreme unbalance of single and three (3) phase loads. Customer loads which cause voltage fluctuation, harmonic current distortion, or harmonic voltage distortion shall not exceed the values given in "IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems, IEEE-519," latest revision.
10. License Requirements. It shall be unlawful for any person other than a duly authorized Department employee or agent of the Department to make an electrical connection between the Department's electrical system and any customer's wiring. With the written approval of the Department, a customer may contract with a qualified electrical contractor licensed under Chapter 19.28 RCW to install any material or equipment in lieu of having Department personnel perform the installation. The qualified electrical contractor shall be solely responsible for any damages resulting from the installation of any temporary service, permanent service, or expanded service and the Department shall be immune from any tortious conduct actions as to that installation.
11. Authorized Service Connections. No customer shall connect their service with that of any other customer, or in any way supply any other person or premises with electricity through their service, except as approved by the Department after the filing of a written application with the Department for the connection and receipt of a permit from the Department for connection.

Master-metered services approved prior to October 5, 1978 are exempt.

New or enlarged services to a duplex or multiple-dwelling building shall have common areas and common equipment supplied through a separate house meter.

12. Hazardous Wiring. The Department may refuse to connect the applicant's service conductors to the Department's electrical system or may disconnect an existing service if in the Department's judgment the applicant's wiring or electrical equipment is hazardous to life or property, or the Department's written rules and regulations have not been followed.
13. Maintenance of Safe Wiring. Customers shall at all times keep their wiring and electrical equipment in such condition that the wiring and equipment can be used without causing damage to the Department, its property, or personnel. The Department shall have the authority at any time to disconnect its electrical system from any wiring or electrical equipment which is defective or dangerous and refuse to reconnect its electrical system until the defective or dangerous wiring or electrical equipment is properly repaired or restored.
14. Access to Meters. Any duly authorized Department employee shall have free and safe access at any reasonable time to any and all premises furnished with electricity by the Department, for the purpose of reading, inspecting, repairing, installing or removing meters, electrical devices, or wiring of the Department, for the connection or disconnection of service, or for any other reasonable purpose connected with the performance of the contract for the provision of electric service. The owner, tenant or person in control of the premises shall restrain and control all dogs or animals of any kind that limit or appear to limit safe access to the premises for any of the purposes cited above. It shall be the responsibility of the owner, its agent or the tenant to remove all safety hazards that might in any way harm or injure authorized City employees performing their duties. Such safety hazards shall include, but not be limited to, booby traps of any kind, construction hazards, sharp or falling objects or debris that may cause injury. The determination of whether a condition is safe will be in the sole discretion of the City employee seeking entry to the premises.

For the Department's systems in underground network areas, twenty-four (24) hour personnel access shall be provided to all vaults and switchgear rooms on customer property. Upon request, the customer shall correct any condition that limits or restricts free and safe access to the Department's meters or service. Failure of the customer to comply within a reasonable time specified shall subject the customer to disconnection of service.

No customer shall convert any room or other building area containing electrical meters, or other devices or wiring of the department, to a dwelling unit or other type of living quarters.

If a room or other building area containing electrical meters or other department equipment is partitioned, the area containing such equipment shall have separate access to common areas or to the outside. All other adopted requirements and regulations for access, clearance, locations, etc., shall apply.

Upon request the customer shall separate electrical meters or other department equipment from living quarters in accordance with the provisions above. Failure of the customer to comply within a reasonable time specified shall subject the customer to disconnection of service.

15. Meter Seals. The Department may install sealable locking devices on certain enclosures containing unmetered conductors, including but not limited to meter sockets, meter enclosures, current transformer enclosures, test switch enclosures, wire troughs, bus gutters, and terminal boxes.
16. Meter Tampering Protection. When current has been diverted around the Department's metering equipment or when the Department's metering equipment has been tampered with to adversely affect metering registration, the Department may require the customer or property owner at his/her expense to repair, relocate or replace his/her service entrance equipment in a manner determined by the Department to prevent future incidents of current diversion.
17. Customers' Responsibility. Notwithstanding any other provisions of any other code or ordinance:

    1. It is the responsibility of customers to protect themselves, life, and property from the use, misuse, and/or availability of electrical current on their premises and from the consequences of the use, misuse, and/or availability of electrical current on their premises.
    2. It is the responsibility of customers to provide, install, use, inspect, and maintain suitable protection and protective devices to protect themselves, life, and property from any defect, failure, malfunction, and/or electrical fault in or originating in any electrical wiring, current-consuming devices, or other equipment which they may own, operate, install, or maintain; and to protect themselves, life, and property from the consequences of any defect, failure, malfunction, and/or electrical fault in or originating in any electrical wiring, current-consuming devices, or other equipment which they may own, operate, install, or maintain, including protection from surge voltages generated within their premises and generated by lightning, switching, and arcing on the Department's system to the full range of parameters described in "IEEE Recommended Practice on Surge Voltages in Low-Voltage AC Power Circuits, C62.41-1991," or latest revision.

    Customers may consult with Department personnel, but such consultation shall not absolve customers from any of the responsibilities in this chapter, nor shall such consultation be relied upon as providing any substitute for professional advice from the customer's own engineers or contractors. It is the responsibility of customers to maintain their electrical systems and to ensure that their electrical service equipment meets all current electrical codes and standards. City Light's responsibility ends and the customer's responsibilities begin at the weatherhead or other point of service as specified by the most recent version of Requirements for Electric Service Connection.

    The customer's service includes, but is not limited to, electrical service panels and entrance equipment (including meter sockets and enclosures), and ducts, vaults, and handholds on the customer's side of the point of service connection. In the case of failure of or damage to direct buried service conductor, the customer is responsible for digging a trench to facilitate repair of the conductor.

18. Customer's Liability. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as placing upon the Department any responsibility for the condition, maintenance, or safety of customers' electrical wiring or current-consuming devices or other equipment; and the Department shall not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from defects, failures, malfunctions, or electrical faults in or originating in any electrical wiring, current-consuming devices, or other equipment which customers may own or operate, install or maintain. The Department shall not be responsible for damage to persons or property arising from the use of electric service on the premises of the customer.
19. Notification of Added Load. In order to prevent damage to the Department's equipment and impairment of its service, customers shall give the Department notice before making any additions to their connected load so that the Department, at its option, may provide the facilities which may be necessary for furnishing the increased service. The customer shall be liable for any damages to the Department that may occur and for any additional charges that may accrue as a result of the failure to so notify the Department.
20. Installation Charges. Any applicant or customer receiving a new or an enlarged service installation or converting an existing service from an overhead connection to an underground connection shall be charged the material and labor costs incurred by the Department in making the installation less the material and labor costs of transformers and associated network protectors supplied by the Department. The Department shall have the authority to establish standard installation charges representing the average material and labor costs for customers who receive basic service installations which do not require a vault as specified in the Department's Requirements for Electric Service Connection manual. Such standard charges shall be developed pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02, Ordinance 102228, as amended). All applicant(s) or customer(s) receiving the conversion of an existing overhead electrical distribution system to an underground system shall:

    1. Reimburse the utility in full for all materials and labor costs in excess of the salvage value of the existing overhead system and conversion costs, if any, from four (4) to twenty-six (26) kV;
    2. Reimburse the utility in full for material and labor costs, if any, to underground and/or replace/install streetlights.

    Installation charges are not rates for electrical service and reflect only costs incurred by the Department for new and expanded services.

21. Losses from Interruptions of Service. The Department shall not be liable for any loss, injury, or damage resulting from the interruption, fluctuation, restoration, or reduction of electric service from any cause beyond the control of the Department, including, but not limited to, fire, flood, drought, winds, acts of elements, court orders, interruptions or riots, generation failures, lack of sufficient generation capacity, breakdowns or damage to facilities of the Department or of third parties, acts of God or public enemy, strikes or other labor disputes, civil, military, or governmental authority, electrical disturbances originating on or transmitted through the electrical systems with which the Department system is interconnected, and acts or omissions of third parties.

In the event of electric service interruption, fluctuation, or reduction resulting from damage to or failure of Department equipment or facilities, the Department has the sole authority to determine the order of repairs. In making the determination of the order of repairs, the Department may consider, but is not bound to, the following order of repair and energization: substations, feeders to police and hospital facilities, and feeders to residential and industrial facilities.

Moreover, the Department shall not be liable for any such loss resulting from repair, maintenance, improvement, renewal, or replacement work on the Department's electrical system, which work, in the sole judgment of the Department, is necessary or prudent. To the extent practical, work shall be done at such times as will minimize inconvenience to the customer and the customer shall be given notice of such work in accordance with the rules and policies of the Department. Further, the Department's liability shall be limited for failure of generation and distribution, inadequacy of energy supply, implementation of emergency plans, or temporary disconnection for repairs and maintenance or for failure to pay for service rendered.

22. Emergencies. During an emergency declared by appropriate civil authority, the Department shall have the authority to curtail electric service to any customer. The Department shall have the authority to restrict the use of loads and/or services during periods of emergency when the Department, in its sole judgment, determines that the continued use of the loads would jeopardize the Department's generation, transmission, or distribution system. Operation of the Department's automatic relay/breaker system is sufficient cause to terminate service. The Department shall prioritize its repair responses during declared emergencies or during system outages caused by weather conditions. In the event of a declared emergency, the Department shall prioritize the restoration of its electrical system, first by responses to directions or orders of the Mayor and Emergency Control Center, and next by restoration of power to the Department's electrical system as the Department's electrical system judgment dictates.
23. No Express or Implied Warranty. The Department provides no express or implied warranties involving the electrical service provided by the Department, including the design and construction of the Department's electrical system, or its transmission and distribution systems.
24. Amp Fee for New or Enlarged Services. The Department shall charge all developers, customers and contractors who install new or enlarged electrical services a fee per panel ampere (commonly abbreviated as "amp"), which is required to be paid before the Department will energize the service. The fee shall apply to all permanent or temporary installations. All installations shall receive a 120 volt 200 amp credit. The fee is calculated by subtracting 200 amps from the total capacity to be installed as determined by the National Electric Code (NEC) (given in amps and 120 volt ratio basis) and then multiplying this value by either a single or a three phase charge as shown in the following table:

#### 21.49.120 - Equipment and facilities provisions.

1. Source of Meters. All meters and other equipment used for billing purposes shall be furnished by the Department.
2. Ownership of Meters. All equipment furnished by the Department shall be and remain the Department's property, and the right to remove, replace, or repair it is expressly reserved.
3. Vandalism and Disconnection of Electrical Equipment. Unless authorized by the Department, no person shall commit the following acts or cause others to commit the following acts: in any manner damage, mutilate, destroy, remove, connect, disconnect, or in any way interfere or tamper with any machinery, poles, wires, meters, seals, or other equipment belonging to, or in any manner connected with, the light and power plant of the Department. Whenever it becomes necessary to disconnect, remove, or relocate any poles, wires, underground facilities, or other equipment belonging to the Department, the work shall be done by or under the direction of the Department. Prior notice shall be given to the Department by the person desiring the work done, stating when and where the work is required. The person desiring the work may be required to pay the cost of labor and material required to do the work.
4. Contractor Work in Vaults. No contractor or any other person may enter a City Light owned electrical handhold or vault without first notifying the Department in writing twenty-four (24) hours prior to such entry and having in hand written permission to enter such handhold or vault and having present a Department safety watch during the entire contractor operation. All such work performed in the electrical handhold or vault shall be performed by the contractor pursuant to the safety requirements of the Washington Administrative Code. No contractor shall connect, disconnect, remove or relocate any Department-owned wires, facilities or other equipment located in an electrical handhold or vault. Any such connection, disconnection, removal or relocation of the Department's facilities shall be done by or under the direction of the Department. The contractor requesting such Department assistance shall pay all cost of labor, materials and administration. Failure to comply with this provision shall be a violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties of Section 21.49.140.
5. Illegal Reconnection. Whenever the Department disconnects a customer's service for failure to pay or any other violation of this chapter, the customer is prohibited from reconnecting such service. Upon discovery of an illegal reconnection, the customer's service shall be disconnected at the pole, hand hole, alleycan, or terminal can. The service shall be reconnected by the Department only when all service charges, reconnect fees, and administrative and investigative charges, including interest, have been paid in full or payment arrangements acceptable to the Department have been made.
6. Penalty for Damage. Persons who in any way damage Department property, facilities, or equipment may be prosecuted and/or charged for replacement, repair, revenue loss, and administrative costs. In the event the damage occurs on private property, the customer, owner, or person in control of the premises will be presumed to be responsible for the damage.
7. Current Diversion. When electricity is diverted around the Department's meter, or when the meter is tampered with or affected so that the meter will not measure and record the full amount of electricity supplied to the customer, owner, or person in control of the premises, the customer, owner, or person will be presumed to be responsible for payment for the electricity which is determined by the Department to have been diverted improperly to his/her own use, and to be in violation of this chapter. The Department may commence actions for three (3) times the amount of actual damages, if any, plus the cost of the suit and reasonable attorney's fees, plus the costs incurred by the Department on account of meter bypassing, tampering or unauthorized reconnections, as provided in RCW 80.28.
8. Notification of Defective Service. The Department shall be notified in case of defective service by the customer, owner, or person in control of the premises.
9. Phase, Voltage, and Frequency Standard. Electric service furnished under this chapter shall be alternating current at sixty (60) Hertz, available at the phase and voltage which may be prescribed by the Department. The variation in steady state average voltage shall not be more than six (6) percent above or five (5) percent below the nominal voltage.

A greater variation of voltage than herein specified may be allowed when service is supplied directly from a transmission line, or in case of emergency service, or in a limited or extended area where the revenues received do not justify close voltage regulation. In such cases the best voltage regulation that is practicable under the circumstances shall be provided. Variations in voltage in excess of those specified, caused by the action of the elements, by infrequent and unavoidable fluctuation of short duration due to system operation, by regional voltage collapse, or by the operation of power apparatus on the customer's premises that necessarily requires large starting currents and only affects the user of such apparatus, shall not be considered a violation of this rule.

Where the utility's distribution facilities supplying customers are adequate and of sufficient capacity to carry actual loads normally imposed, the utility may require that equipment on customers' premises shall be such that starting and operating characteristics will not cause an instantaneous voltage drop of more than four (4) percent of the nominal voltage or cause objectionable flicker in other customers' lights.

The nominal sixty (60) Hertz frequency is maintained within two (2) percent above and two (2) percent below for normal operating conditions and may have excursions to ten (10) percent above or ten (10) percent below under severe operating conditions.

10. KWh Pulse Data. Subject to charge and the capability of metering equipment, the Department will provide a connection to its metering facilities to supply kWh data pulses to customers. Demand interval timing pulses will not be provided to customers.
11. The Department shall continue to incorporate arts funding into its capital projects constructed within the municipal boundaries of the City, however, the Department shall not be permitted to fund any such program from the Light Fund on any capital project outside the City limits.

#### 21.49.125 - Open Access Transmission Tariff, Rates and Interconnection Procedures.

The Department shall offer an open access transmission tariff ("OATT"). Due to the excessive length of the OATT, it is not printed herein. However, a copy of the OATT, including its Schedules 1 through 9, Attachments A through L, and Generator Interconnection Procedures and Agreements, is available at the Seattle City Clerk's Office and can also be found on Seattle City Light's public web page.


#### 21.49.130 - Authority.

1. The Department shall have the authority to interpret the provisions of this chapter where necessary to implement and enforce its terms and provisions, provided, however, such interpretation shall be consistent with the intent of the City Council in setting the rates and terms and conditions for the use of the electric service provided under this chapter and shall not expand the scope and authority contained therein.
2. Rule-making and Contract Authority.

    1. The Department shall have authority to adopt and file as appropriate rules, regulations, policies, and procedures relating to its performance of the provisions of this chapter and to the operation of the Department's light and power system. The Department may require compliance with such rules, regulations, policies and procedures as a condition for the supply or continued supply of electric service.
    2. Effectively managing its power supply portfolio to achieve balance between supply and customer demand requires that City Light transact in the wholesale energy markets for energy and transmission services and products, including the purchase or sale of short-term capacity or energy, or integration, transmission or ancillary services. The Department may therefore enter into contracts with any city or town, public utility district, governmental agency, municipal corporation, mutual association, broker, agent, or with any person, firm, or corporation, or any other member of the general public, outside its service area, for an effective term of not more than 24 months from the month following the date on which the contract is first signed ("prompt month"), providing for the acquisition, exchange or sale of capacity or energy, or integration, transmission or ancillary services, on terms most favorable to the Department under such circumstances and in compliance with state law, including RCW 43.09.210. Such acquisition, sale or exchange shall be made on a basis representing the value of such capacity or energy, or integration, transmission or ancillary services, under then existing market conditions and may include provisions that require indemnification by the Department.
    3. The Department may enter into or amend agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration providing for reimbursements from Bonneville of some or all of the costs of operating energy conservation programs authorized by the City Council. The Department shall determine that such agreements or amendments to such agreements shall not incur any indebtedness or the acceptance of moneys imposing any duties or obligations on the City which are inconsistent with the Department's budget appropriation for such energy conservation programs. The Department shall provide a written notification prior to the execution of such contracts and a copy of such contracts to the appropriate authorizing committee of the City Council.
    4. The Department may enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of environmental attributes, including but not limited to, renewable energy credits ("RECs"), green house gas off-sets, and carbon credits to meet policy and regulatory requirements in a cost effective and timely manner. The Department may enter into such contracts in advance of the target date for acquisition identified in the Department's Integrated Resource Plan or the date required by state or federal law. These purchases will be made within the Department's yearly budget authority limits. Sales will be made on an as-needed basis to balance demand with supply of these products, and to minimize overall costs to ratepayers.
3. Contracts and Authorized Agents. The Department may also enter into contracts of a general nature relating to the utility system. No promise, agreement, or representation of any employee or agent of the Department with reference to furnishing electricity shall be binding on the Department unless it is embodied in writing and signed by a duly authorized agent of the Department in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
4. Authority to Interrupt Service. The Department shall have the authority to restrict the use of loads and/or services during scheduled maintenance outages and during periods of emergency when the Department determines that the continued use of the loads would jeopardize the Department's generation, transmission, or distribution system.
5. Special Service Charges and Interest Charges. The Department may add service charges or may separately bill customers to recover certain administrative, investigative and collection expenses in addition to any civil fine or forfeiture imposed under Section 21.49.140. These may include but are not limited to dishonored checks; field calls on delinquent accounts; service disconnections and reconnections resulting from City ordinance violations or failure to pay; and field calls, lab tests and office work involved in detecting, reporting, investigating and correcting cases of current diversion. The Department may also add interest charges on delinquent customer accounts and for other services including, but not limited to, C-bills and bills for damage. The Department may develop a standard per month charge for accounts that are too small to economically calculate interest. Such interest charges or standard charges may be added to the bill for each month or part thereof that the bill is delinquent. The Department shall have authority to bill for interest charges applied to the value of diverted current or unbilled service used during a billing period or periods, with interest charges beginning to run on the established due date for each billing period during which current was diverted or unbilled. Interest charged is to be at the statutory nominal percentage rate, compounded monthly.
6. Recovery of Service Disconnection Costs. The Department shall have the authority to establish and collect service disconnection charges based on cost when such charges are adopted pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Code (Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02, Ordinance 102228, as amended). If service is disconnected for any violation of the provisions of this chapter, a service disconnection charge shall be added to the account. If service is disconnected at the request of a customer or property owner, a service disconnection charge shall be billed to the customer or property owner making the request, unless the service is disconnected when the purpose is to maintain service entrance equipment or enhance its safety. If service is disconnected for failure to pay bills when due, the service shall not be restored until payment in full has been received by the Department, or satisfactory arrangements have been made for payment of all charges. Reconnection cannot be assured on the same day payment is made.
7. Equipment Rental. The Department shall have authority to sell, rent, lease, construct, install, operate, and/or service material, supplies, facilities, appliances, or equipment for the use or conservation of electricity. The Department may also establish and collect charges based on cost, conservation, and/or the use of electricity and enter into related agreements. Any agreements entered into or charges made prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter are ratified and confirmed.

#### 21.49.140 - Offenses and penalties.

Violation of any provision of this chapter constitutes a civil offense and a violation of any provision of this chapter will subject the violator to a civil fine or forfeiture not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500) for each separate offense in addition to the City's cost of investigating and establishing such violation. Violators of this chapter are also subject to the provisions of RCW Chapters 9 and 9A and RCW Chapter 80.28 and a conviction or judgment under these RCW chapters will not relieve the violator of the payment of a fine and cost imposed under this section of the chapter.


#### 21.49.160 - Continuity.

No action or proceedings now pending, civil or criminal, and no cause of action heretofore arising or offense heretofore committed under ordinances heretofore enacted shall be affected in any way by the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter but any such action or proceedings shall be conducted to final judgment and all such causes of action and offenses shall be prosecuted in the same manner as if this chapter had not been enacted.


#### 21.49.180 - Ratification and confirmation.

Any act pursuant to the authority and prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter is hereby ratified and confirmed.

The notice shall state that the grantee is entitled to appeal the City's findings to the Hearing Examiner, in accordance with Chapter 3.02, within 15 days of receipt of such notice. If, within the time period specified in the notice, the problem is not cured to the City's satisfaction, and if the grantee has not filed a timely notice of appeal, then the City may terminate the franchise by ordinance as of a date to be specified in the ordinance. The ordinance may also specify that the franchise will only terminate if the grantee does not comply with the City's requirements within such period as the City may also fix in such ordinance.
5. If the grantee files a timely notice of appeal, pursuant to Chapter 3.02, of the City's notice of intent to terminate its franchise, the Hearing Examiner shall schedule and conduct a hearing in accordance with the Hearing Examiner Rules of Practice and Procedure. The Hearing Examiner shall:

    1. Determine whether any refusal, neglect, or failure by grantee to do or comply with any material requirement contained in this Chapter 21.60, a franchise, or rule or regulation of the Office of Cable Communications validly adopted to this Chapter 21.60, has occurred; and
    2. If so, determine whether such refusal, neglect, or failure by grantee was beyond the control of grantee as set forth in Section 21.60.270.
6. If the Hearing Examiner determines that no refusal, neglect, or failure has occurred, then the franchise will not terminate.
7. If the Hearing Examiner determines that a refusal, neglect, or failure has occurred, but that it was caused by events beyond the control of the grantee as set forth in Section 21.60.270, then the franchise will not terminate and the requirements of Section 21.60.270 will apply. The Director of the Office of Cable Communications may enter into an agreement with the grantee concerning an appropriate action to cure the grounds on which the proposed franchise termination was based.
8. If the Hearing Examiner determines that a refusal, neglect, or failure has occurred, and that the refusal, neglect, or failure by the grantee was within the grantee's control, then the Hearing Examiner shall report such determination to the Council and to the Office of Cable Communications, and the City may by ordinance declare that the franchise of such grantee shall be terminated as of a date to be specified in the ordinance. The ordinance may also specify that the franchise will only terminate if the grantee does not comply with the City's requirements within such period as the City may also fix in such ordinance.
9. The termination of any franchise shall in no way affect any rights of the City that survive termination under the franchise or any provision of law.

##### 21.60.125 - Procedures in the event of expiration, termination, revocation, or non-renewal

1. Continuity of service

    1. A grantee shall operate the cable system pursuant to this Chapter 21.60 and its franchise without interruption, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter 21.60 or its franchise. If at any time the grantee's franchise is revoked, terminated, or not renewed upon expiration in accordance with the provisions of federal law, a grantee shall, at the City's request, as trustee for its successor in interest, operate the cable system for a temporary period (the "transition period") as necessary to maintain service to subscribers, and shall cooperate with the City to assure an orderly transition from it to the City or another franchise holder.
    2. During the transition period, a grantee shall neither sell any of the cable system assets serving City customers nor make any physical, material, administrative, or operational change that would tend to degrade the quality of service to subscribers, decrease gross revenues, or materially increase expenses without the express permission, in writing, of the City.
    3. The transition period shall be no longer than the reasonable period required to arrange for an orderly transfer of the cable system to the City or to another franchise holder, unless mutually agreed to by a grantee and the City. During the transition period, a grantee will continue to be obligated to comply with the terms and conditions of this Chapter 21.60, its franchise, and applicable laws and regulations.
    4. If a grantee abandons the cable system during the franchise term or fails to operate the cable system in accordance with the terms of this Chapter 21.60 and its franchise during any transition period, the City, at its option, may operate a grantee's cable system, designate another entity to operate the grantee's cable system temporarily until the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the City or until a grantee's franchise is revoked and a new grantee selected by the City is providing service, or obtain an injunction requiring a grantee to continue operations.
    5. For its management services during the transition period, the grantee shall be entitled to receive as compensation the "net income" generated during the transition period. For the purposes of this subsection 21.60.125.A.5, "net income" means the amount remaining after deducting from gross revenues all of the actual, direct and indirect expenses associated with operating the grantee's cable system, including the franchise fee, interest, depreciation, and all taxes, all as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
2. City's right to purchase

    1. If at any time the grantee's franchise is revoked, terminated, or not renewed upon expiration in accordance with the provisions of federal law, the City shall have the option to purchase the cable system.
    2. The City may, at any time thereafter, offer in writing to purchase the grantee's cable system. The grantee shall have 30 days from receipt of a written offer from the City within which to accept or reject the offer.
    3. In any case where the City elects to purchase the cable system, the purchase shall be closed within 120 days of the date of the City's audit of a current profit and loss statement of the grantee. The City shall pay for the cable system in cash or certified funds, and the grantee shall deliver appropriate bills of sale and other instruments of conveyance.
    4. The price for the cable system shall be determined as follows:

        1. In the case of the expiration of a franchise without renewal, at fair market value determined on the basis of the grantee's cable system valued as a going concern, but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. In order to obtain the fair market value, this valuation shall be reduced by the amount of any lien, encumbrance, or other obligation of the grantee that the City would assume; or
        2. In the case of revocation for cause, the equitable price of the grantee's cable system.
3. City's right to remove

    1. In the event that a purchase has not been completed in accordance with subsection 21.60.125.B, the City may order the removal of the above-ground cable system facilities and the underground cable system facilities from the City at the grantee's sole expense within a reasonable period of time as determined by the City. In removing the cable system facilities, the Grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that is made by it and shall leave all rights-of-way, public places and private property in as good condition as that prevailing prior to the grantee's removal of its equipment without affecting the electrical or telephone cable wires or attachments. The indemnification and insurance provisions of the franchise shall remain in full force and effect during the period of removal, and the grantee shall not be entitled to compensation.
    2. If the grantee fails to complete any removal required by this subsection 21.60.125.C to the City's satisfaction, after written notice to the grantee, the City may cause the work to be done and the grantee shall reimburse the City for the costs incurred within 30 days after receipt of an itemized list of the costs.
4. The City may seek legal and/or equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this Section 21.60.125.

##### 21.60.130 - Subscriber rates

1. By accepting a franchise pursuant to the terms and conditions imposed by this Chapter 21.60, a grantee agrees that the City has the authority and right to regulate the grantee's cable service rates to the maximum extent permitted by law or applicable FCC rules and regulations.
2. All charges to subscribers shall be consistent with a schedule of rates established by the grantee for all services, installations, and equipment offered.
3. Unless exempt by federal law or FCC rule or regulation from any requirement to do so, a grantee shall not, with regard to rates and any other conditions of service, within the franchise area, discriminate or grant any preference or advantage to any person; provided, however, that a grantee may establish different rates for different services as long as the grantee does not discriminate between subscribers of the same services. Nothing in this Chapter 21.60 either prevents a grantee from offering promotional or bulk discount rates as long as such discounts are available in a uniform and consistent manner in accordance with existing law or prohibits trade promotions customary in the industry as long as such trade promotions are not otherwise prohibited by law.
4. Unless exempt by federal law or FCC rule or regulation from any requirement to do so, any applicant for a new franchise or any grantee operating under an existing franchise and proposing a change in rates shall send to the Office of Cable Communications a schedule of the proposed new or changed rates together with supporting financial data. The Office of Cable Communications shall review submitted materials and verify that the proposed rates reflect allowable increases, in accordance with existing law and FCC rules and regulations.
5. A grantee shall give to subscribers and to the Office of Cable Communications a minimum of 30 days' advance written notice of any proposed change in rates.

##### 21.60.140 - Performance bonds

1. No later than the date by which the ordinance requires the grantee to sign the franchise, a grantee shall deliver to the Office of Cable Communications for approval a good and sufficient bond in the penal sum of not less than $100,000 and maintain the bond continuously in effect. The bond shall be executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the state as a surety or by other sureties acceptable to the Office of Cable Communications and in a form approved by the City Attorney. The bond shall stipulate that grantee shall strictly comply with each and every condition and covenant of its franchise. The Office of Cable Communications shall file the approved bond with the City Clerk.
2. If at any time during the franchise period the Office of Cable Communications determines that the conduct of a grantee warrants a higher assurance under the bond, then the Office of Cable Communications may require the grantee to furnish a new or additional bond in such amount as may be specified and with such sureties as are acceptable to the Office of Cable Communications. The grantee shall upon demand furnish such new or additional bond and maintain it continuously in effect.

##### 21.60.150 - Indemnification

1. General indemnification. By accepting a franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter 21.60, grantee covenants and agrees for itself, its officers, agents, employees, successors, and assigns, at all times to indemnify, defend, and hold the City, its officers, officials, boards, commissions, agents, and employees (collectively the "indemnified parties") harmless from and against any and all lawsuits, claims, causes of actions, injury, damages, judgments, settlements, disability, losses, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements of counsel) of any nature that any of the indemnified parties may at any time suffer, sustain, or incur arising out of, or based upon, or in any way connected with any act or omission of the grantee, its successors, or assigns, its parent or subsidiary corporations, its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors, or any of their employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors, including without limitation any construction, excavation, reconstruction, readjustment, repair, maintenance, operation, or use of the right-of-way or other property of the City, or by exercising any privilege conferred by this Chapter 21.60 or by such franchise, and including any neglect or omission to keep the cable system in a safe condition. The grantee's obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold the indemnified parties harmless includes the obligation to pay attorneys' fees, expert fees, and all other costs of defending any indemnified claim, including all costs incurred by the City in recovering against the grantee. The grantee shall consult and cooperate with the City in the grantee's defense of the indemnified parties. If judgment is rendered against the indemnified parties in any such suit or action, the grantee shall fully satisfy such judgment within 90 days after such suit or action has been finally determined. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the grantee's indemnity obligation shall not be extinguished or reduced in the event that an act or omission of the indemnified parties is a concurrent or contributing cause of the claim, except that no indemnity shall be owed in the event that the cause of any claim is the sole negligence of the indemnified parties.
2. Indemnification for relocation. By accepting a franchise granted pursuant to this Chapter 21.60, grantee covenants and agrees to indemnify the City for any damages, claims, additional costs, or expenses assessed against, or payable by, the City arising out of or resulting, directly or indirectly, from the grantee's failure to remove, adjust, or relocate any of its facilities located on City property or right-of-way in a timely manner in accordance with the franchise and relocation schedule, unless grantee's failure arises directly from the City's negligence or willful misconduct.

##### 21.60.160 - Insurance

As long as grantee possesses any right or privilege granted pursuant to this Chapter 21.60 or franchise, and before beginning any work in the City, the grantee shall deliver to the Office of Cable Communications a policy or policies of insurance (or a certificate thereof) showing that it has procured and is maintaining at all times the following insurance, in a form approved by the Office of Cable Communications, including an endorsement naming the City as an additional insured or blanket additional insured subject to a standard "Separation of Insureds" clause, and shall be primary and non-contributory with any insurance or self-insurance coverage maintained by the City, protecting and holding the City, its officers, boards, commissions, agents, and employees, harmless from any and all damages of any kind that may arise in connection with the services or work to be performed under this Chapter 21.60 or franchise, whether or not such damages are alleged to arise or result from acts or omissions that are the sole negligence of the City, its officers, employees, or agents, or the combined negligence of the City and others:

1. Service to low-income households

    1. New franchise

        1. Each new franchise shall allow grantee flexibility as to where and how to provide cable service within its franchise area. As provided in subsection 21.60.170.A.1.b, grantee's actual service area must satisfy a low-income service provision requirement within two years of the effective date of the franchise. Grantee is encouraged to satisfy that requirement as soon within that period as is feasible.
        2. At all times after the date that is two years after the effective date of any new franchise, a significant portion of the total households to which grantee offers cable service shall be households that fall below the median income level as measured by census block group data.
    2. Renewed franchise. At all times, a significant portion of the total households to which grantee offers cable service shall be households that fall below the median income level as measured by census block group data.
    3. All grantees to verify low-income requirement. Grantee shall meet with and provide documentation to the Office of Cable Communications not less frequently than semiannually to demonstrate that it has met the low-income service provision requirement in subsection 21.60.170.A.1.b (for a new franchise, if applicable at the time of a particular meeting) or in subsection 21.60.170.A.2 (for a renewed franchise). Quarterly, the Office of Cable Communications shall provide to Council a copy of grantee's documentation demonstrating that grantee has met its low-income service provision requirement along with the Office of Cable Communications' analysis of grantee's documentation. If grantee does not demonstrate compliance, the Office of Cable Communications shall report the noncompliance to Council in its quarterly report. The Office of Cable Communications shall provide these quarterly reports for the first five years of a new franchise, and for the first two years of a renewed franchise, and shall continue to provide these quarterly reports thereafter if so requested by the chair of the Council committee with oversight responsibility for cable issues.

        1. If the Office of Cable Communications determines that the requirement is not being met, it may impose other requirements, including but not limited to (i) imposing penalties; (ii) requiring grantee to expand the provision of cable service to other areas of the city, to ensure that the low-income service provision requirement will be met; and (iii) mandating any other action intended to incent compliance with the low-income service provision requirement.
        2. The Office of Cable Communications may also impose penalties for grantee's failure to comply with such additional requirements within a specified time.
    4. The Office of Cable Communications shall develop procedures and metrics to implement this subsection 21.60.170.A to describe how compliance with the low-income service provision requirement will be measured and what threshold of service will be deemed to constitute compliance.
2. Other service requirements

    1. Each franchise shall document, to the satisfaction of the Office of Cable Communications, the service area where grantee intends to initially offer cable service and, if applicable, where grantee currently offers cable service.
    2. Grantee shall not deny cable service to any customer based upon race, nor shall grantee base decisions about construction or maintenance of the cable system or facilities upon race.
3. Build out requirements. The build out requirements, if any, for a franchise shall be set forth in grantee's franchise.
4. Construction requirements. The construction of new cable facilities or the extension of existing cable facilities by grantee shall be accomplished in accordance with a plan, design, and construction schedule first submitted to and approved by the Office of Cable Communications with respect to the requirements of this Chapter 21.60, and then submitted to and approved by the Director of Transportation with respect to the requirements of Title 15. In either case, grantee shall at all times comply with this Chapter 21.60 and with Title 15 as the same now reads or is later amended, except that if this Chapter 21.60 and Title 15 are in any respect inconsistent the provisions of Title 15 control.

##### 21.60.180 - Approval of the Director of Transportation required for right-of-way use

1. If it is practicable to use poles already in the right-of-way, the grantee shall use such poles and shall comply with Chapter 15.32 in doing so. If grantee does not use poles already in the right-of-way, all poles, cables, wires, antennae, conduits, or appurtenances shall be constructed and erected in compliance with the provisions of the pole attachment permit(s) and street use permit(s) authorizing their installation.
2. If, in any part of the franchise area for which the grantee has been awarded a franchise, the City proposes to place electric power or communications wires and cables underground or to require the same, grantee may place facilities in the underground project, but if grantee does not do so and subsequently enters the area to serve it, grantee shall place its facilities underground. In areas where all other utilities have their facilities underground the grantee shall underground its facilities in accordance with Section 15.32.130.
3. Nothing in this Chapter 21.60 prevents the City or any local improvement district or utility local improvement district from sewering, paving, grading, altering, or otherwise improving or reimproving any of the streets of the City, including the installation of City-owned utilities, and the City is not liable for any damages resulting to the grantee by reason of the performance of such work or by exercise of such rights of the City. This Chapter 21.60 does not deprive the City of any rights or privileges that it now has, or that may hereafter be conferred upon it, to regulate and control the use of the right-of-way. If any right-of-way is improved or the grade thereof changed, modified, raised, or lowered, or the size, position, or location of any City-owned public utilities changed, modified, or altered, any of the installations belonging to the grantee that may be affected by or conflict with any such changes, alterations, or modifications shall be promptly adjusted, removed, altered, raised, lowered, or otherwise modified to conform to the improvements or changes made, by and at the expense of grantee and in conformity with the requirements of the Director of Transportation.
4. If it is necessary for the grantee, in the erection of poles or in the construction of underground pipes or conduits, to excavate in any portion of any right-of-way, the grantee shall file with the Director of Transportation an application for permission to do such work in accordance with Title 15, and obtain a permit from or approval of the Director of Transportation before beginning such work. If grantee disturbs the surface of any City right-of-way for any purpose, grantee shall be responsible for its restoration in accordance with Section 15.32.160. The City has the right to make use of any or all of the poles of the grantee for wires, cables, and conductors to carry any City-owned systems or facilities requiring such use.
5. If the Director of Transportation grants permission for use of any right-of-way of the City for the purpose of moving any building or structure, then grantee shall raise or remove any wires, cables, or conductors that may obstruct the removal of such building or structure in accordance with Section 15.32.110.

##### 21.60.190 - Permission from property owner or tenant for installation

1. If cable passes over or under private or publicly owned property, grantee is solely responsible for obtaining all necessary permission from the property owner.
2. Grantee shall not install or attach any of its facilities to any property without first securing the written permission of the owner or tenant of any property involved, or of such other person who has the right to approve or disapprove the attachment (authorized party), except if there is an existing utility easement. If such permission or easement is later revoked, the grantee at the request of the authorized party shall promptly remove any of its facilities and promptly restore the property to its original condition at grantee's expense. Grantee shall perform all such installations and removals in compliance with state and local law and shall be responsible for any damage to residences or other property caused by the installation or the removal. In the event a grantee fails to perform such restoration, the authorized party has the right to do so at the sole expense of the grantee. Demand for payment for such restoration must be submitted by the authorized party in writing to the grantee.
3. Provision of cable services may not be conditioned on any right of entry agreement that requires an exclusive, long-term service commitment. However, the preceding sentence does not affect the grantee's right to furnish additional consideration in exchange for a right of entry agreement.

##### 21.60.200 - Compliance with chapter, franchise and other laws

Construction, maintenance, and operation of the grantee's system, including subscriber connections, shall be in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter 21.60, the grantee's franchise agreement with the City, and, unless otherwise provided in the franchise, the provisions of all other applicable codes, ordinances, rules, regulations, and specifications of the City currently existing or later enacted, including, but not limited to, those concerning electrical work and street use excavation, removal and relocation of property, and other street work.


##### 21.60.210 - Compliance with state and federal laws and regulations

This Chapter 21.60 and any franchise granted pursuant to it shall at all times be interpreted as to require the grantee to comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including FCC rules and regulations relating to the provision of cable services. Such interpretation of this Chapter 21.60 does not diminish, impair, alter, or affect any contractual benefit to the City or grantee or any contractual obligation of the grantee under any franchise issued under this Chapter 21.60.


##### 21.60.220 - Obligation to comply promptly

Time is of the essence with respect to a grantee's obligations in any franchise granted under this Chapter 21.60. The grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply promptly with any of the provisions of this Chapter 21.60 or its franchise with the City by any failure of the City to enforce prompt compliance.


##### 21.60.240 - No recourse against City for loss or expense

A grantee has no recourse against the City for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of this Chapter 21.60 or for any franchise issued under this Chapter 21.60 or because of its enforcement.


##### 21.60.250 - Rights reserved in the City

Every franchise granted under this Chapter 21.60 shall contain provisions that ensure compliance with all requirements of Chapter 20.42 and Chapter 20.45, as the same may be amended, including, but not limited to, the affirmative efforts requirements in Section 20.42.050 and the prohibition on discrimination in providing benefits in Section 20.45.020.


##### 21.60.270 - Force majeure

If a grantee is prevented or delayed in the performance of any of its obligations under this Chapter 21.60 by reason of acts of God, floods, fire, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, or other unavoidable casualties, insurrection, war, riot, vandalism, strikes, or sabotage, to the extent such event prevents performance by the grantee and such event is beyond grantee's control, the grantee shall have a reasonable time under the circumstances to perform such obligation under this Chapter 21.60, or to get a substitute for such obligation to the satisfaction of the City. If grantee claims a force majeure event, grantee shall give prompt written notice of the same to the City and shall set forth its plan of action to meet the obligations of this Chapter 21.60 once the force majeure event no longer prevents the grantee's performance.


##### 21.60.280 - Effective date

Nothing in this Chapter 21.60 shall abridge, impair, alter, modify, or in any way affect any right, privilege, or immunity of either the grantee or the City conferred by or arising under any cable franchise granted before and remaining in effect on the effective date of the ordinance introduced as C.B. 118347. Any franchise renewed pursuant to Section 21.60.100 after the effective date of the ordinance introduced as C.B. 118347 shall be subject to the terms of Chapter 21.60 as amended.

1. The grantee shall have a right to first resolve customer inquiries and complaints without delay and interference from the City.
2. Where a given complaint is not addressed by the grantee to the customer's satisfaction, the City may intervene.

If the noncompliance is not cured within 30 days, monetary sanctions of up to $1,000 may be imposed to encourage compliance.
3. These standards are intended to be of general application; however, the grantee shall be relieved of any obligations hereunder if it is unable to perform due to a force majeure event listed in Section 21.60.270 affecting a significant portion of the franchise area. The grantee is free to exceed these standards to the benefit of its customers, and such shall be considered performance for the purpose of enforcing these standards.
4. The provisions contained in this Subchapter II and in franchise agreements should be interpreted consistently wherever possible. If the provisions of this Subchapter II and any franchise agreement are inconsistent, the provisions of this Subchapter II control.

##### 21.60.820 - Customer service

The grantee shall keep a record of the notification. In such circumstances, the customer must contact the grantee to reschedule the appointment. In the event that a technician arrives without a prior appointment, and the customer must be present for service to proceed, and the customer is absent, the grantee will not be considered to have responded to a request for service.
        3. If a grantee representative fails to keep an installation or service appointment for any reason, the grantee will contact the customer before the end of the scheduled appointment and reschedule the appointment at a time convenient for the customer.
    3. Outages and Other Service Interruptions.

In the event of a system outage (an outage is a service interruption that involves a loss or substantial impairment in reception on all channels for a period of one hour or more) resulting from grantee equipment failure affecting five or more customers, the grantee shall initiate repairs within two hours after the third customer calls to report the outage.
        2. All customers who call the grantee to report an outage shall receive credit for the entire day on which the outage occurred and for each additional day the outage continues.
        3. The grantee shall notify the City of any outage of at least four continuous hours that affects at least ten percent of its customers.
        4. The grantee shall initiate repairs for all other service interruptions resulting from grantee equipment failure within 24 hours.

        11. Special services for customers with disabilities including any discounts required by the franchise or other agreements; and
        12. Days, hours of operation, and locations of the service centers.
    2. The grantee shall concurrently send to the Office of Cable Communications a copy of all notices provided to customers under this subsection 21.60.820.E.
    3. The grantee shall provide customers with written notification, and announcements on the cable system, of any changes in programming, services, or channel positions as soon as possible, but no less than 30 days in advance of such changes if the change is within the control of the grantee.

At the customer's request, the grantee shall send the customer a written statement detailing such charges. Grantee shall also provide customers with a written statement of the total estimated charges before leaving the location at which the work was performed.
    6. All promotional materials advertising cable services shall accurately disclose price terms.

The grantee shall distribute promotional material in multiple unit buildings only with the approval of the building owner. The grantee shall not condition the provision of cable services on the receipt of such approval.
    7. All listings of the grantee's services shall conspicuously display the availability of all service tiers and corresponding prices for City customers, including the cost of either the basic cable service subject to rate regulation or the cost of the grantee's lowest priced cable service tier.

The foregoing does not restrict, condition, or inhibit the grantee's ability to negotiate longer-term right of entry agreements prior to offering service to multiple unit building residents for the purpose of maintaining grantee's on-site signal and facilities. For purposes of this subsection 21.60.820.F, a "right of entry agreement" means an agreement that permits the grantee access to the building to extend its distribution cable from the grantee's cable system in the right-of-way or public easement to the utility closet or other demarcation point in the multiple unit building.
7. Safety. The grantee shall install and locate its facilities, cable system, and equipment in compliance with all federal, state, local, and company safety standards, and in such manner as shall not unduly interfere with or endanger persons or property. If the grantee receives notice that an unsafe condition exists with respect to its equipment, the grantee shall investigate such condition immediately, and shall take such measures as are necessary to remove or eliminate any unsafe condition.
8. Satisfaction guaranteed. The grantee shall guarantee customer satisfaction for every customer who requests new installation of cable service, video, or interactive television or adds any additional cable service to the customer's cable subscription. Any such customer who adds expanded basic or other higher tier of video service or interactive television to the customer's cable subscription and then requests discontinuation of such upgraded service within 30 days due to dissatisfaction with the service shall receive an account credit in an amount equal to the pro rata charge for the remaining days of service following the request to discontinue the service. If a customer subscribes to a service under a promotion that provides free service and chooses to discontinue the service during the promotion window, there shall be no charge of any kind for the service or for discontinuing the service.

If the City has reason to believe that the grantee has failed to comply with any of these standards or has failed to perform in a timely manner, the City may require in writing that the grantee remedy the alleged noncompliance and provide an opportunity to cure. If the alleged noncompliance is denied or not cured to the satisfaction of the City, the City may impose monetary sanctions or follow other procedures set forth in individual franchise agreements.
6. Notice.

    1. At the City's request, the grantee shall include on its billing statement, in a clear and conspicuous manner, information on how to contact the City's Office of Cable Communications. At the City's discretion, such information may include, but shall not be limited to, the address, telephone number, and e-mail address of the Office of Cable Communications.
    2. At least annually, the grantee shall notify its customers of the existence, location and function of the City's Office of Cable Communications and shall provide, in a form provided by or approved by the City, a summary of this Subchapter II and the remedies and procedures available to its customers.
7. Notification of Complaints. If the City receives customer service complaints regarding other services provided by the grantee, such as the use or connection of non-cable services, the City will notify the grantee of such complaints. If the grantee demonstrates an egregious pattern of failing to resolve such complaints with its customers, the City will forward the complaints to the appropriate state or federal agency.

##### 21.60.840 - Verification of compliance by quarterly reporting form

The grantee shall maintain, in a manner consistent with the privacy rights of customers, an accurate and comprehensive file of: (1) any and all complaints regarding the cable system or the grantee's operation of the cable system to provide cable service, by number and type and their disposition; (2) service requests, identifying the number and nature of the requests and their disposition; (3) service interruptions and their disposition; and (4) all telephone calls from customers to grantee, and their response times.


1. The Office of Cable Communications will develop and provide a quarterly reporting form to monitor the grantee's compliance with this Subchapter II. The grantee shall complete the form and send it to the Office of Cable Communications on a quarterly basis, within 30 days of the end of the quarter. All data in the report shall reflect activity within an area that reasonably approximates the jurisdictional boundaries of King County, including the City. To measure the grantee's compliance with standards related to customer telephone response times, the report shall include, at a minimum, the following information from the grantee: 1) the total number of calls offered to a grantee; 2) the number of calls handled by the grantee's IVR within 30 seconds; 3) the total number of calls during which a customer requested, in any fashion, to speak with a CSR; 4) the total number of calls transferred to a CSR; 5) the total number of calls transferred to a CSR that were answered within 30 seconds; 6) the average wait time before a call to a CSR was answered; and 7) other information that may be requested by the Office of Cable Communications, and is retained by the grantee, to assess the overall level and effectiveness of grantee's customer service practices or is necessary to address customer service complaints. If calls abandoned by callers exceed five percent of calls handled, the grantee shall provide an explanation. Any grantee of a new franchise is not required to complete or send the report described in this Section 21.60.840 until 12 months after the effective date of the new franchise.
2. To determine whether the grantee has met the standard for CSR telephone response time, the Office of Cable Communications shall divide the total number of calls answered by a CSR within 30 seconds by the total number of calls transferred to a CSR. This quotient shall not reflect calls that are self-directed to the IVR only. Only telephone calls that result in a customer being directed to a CSR shall be included in this standard.
3. If the grantee fails to provide such reports on a timely basis, or if they are incomplete, the City may impose monetary sanctions of up to $1,000 for the first quarter, up to $2,000 for the second consecutive quarter of noncompliance, up to $2,500 for the third consecutive quarter of noncompliance, and up to $3,000 for each subsequent consecutive non-compliant quarters to encourage compliance.
4. The grantee shall permit the City to review and audit the information required under this Section 21.60.840 at any time during normal business hours upon reasonable notice.

#### CABLE TELEVISION GLOSSARY OF TERMS

"All-channel antenna" means an antenna which receives signals equally well over a wide band of frequencies.

"Amplifier" means a device consisting of electronic components used to increase power, voltage or current of a signal.

"Amplitude modulated link" means a form of microwave which uses amplitude modulation of a microwave carrier rather than the conventional frequency modulation usually used for microwave television links. This is usually accomplished by heterodyne conversion from conventional TV channels.

"Antenna array" means a radiating or receiving system composed of several spaced radiators or elements.

"Attenuation loss" means the actual power loss in a cable, attenuator, coupling, or other device when electrical energy is transmitted through it, usually expressed in decibels.

"Automatic tilt" means automatic correction of change in tilt, or the relative level of signals of different frequencies.

"Back matched tap" means a cable tap device which employs transformer isolation and also employs impedance matching at the tap-off points.

"Bridger" means an amplifier connected directly into the main trunk line to feed distribution cables with minimum insertion loss in the main trunk line.

"Gain" means a measure of the signal level increase in an amplifier usually expressed in dB.

"Head-end" means the electronic equipment located at the start of a cable system, usually including antennas, preamplifiers, frequency converters, demodulators, modulators and related equipment. Both the building and the equipment which receives the television signals and processes them before application to the cable system are known as the "head-end."

"Insertion loss" means additional loss in a system when a device such as a directional coupler is inserted; equal to the difference in signal level between input and output of such a device.

"Modulation" means the process, or result of the process, whereby some characteristic on one wave is varied in accordance with another wave.

"Noise" means, in general, any unwanted signal or interference. It usually refers to unwanted signals of a random nature arising from thermal effects in the input circuits of amplifiers. This form of noise is known as "snow."

"Parabolic antenna" means an antenna that has a folded dipole or feed horn mounted at the focal point of a metal or mesh dish having a concave shape known as a parabola.

"Preamplifier" means an electronic device, usually having superior input noise figure, designed to strengthen or boost a weak off-air signal to a level where it will be sufficient to drive succeeding amplifiers.

"Pressure tap" means a device which connects to the center conductor and shield of a distribution cable to extract television signals; tap does not require cutting of cable to make contact for a subscriber drop.

"Resolution" means a measure of picture resolving capabilities of a television system determined primarily by band width, scan rates and aspect ratio; relates to fineness of details perceivable.

"Return loss" means the ratio of incident to reflected power, usually applied to measure the reflected signal at an interface between cable and equipment or to measure reflections arising from structural imperfections within a cable.

"Semiconductor" means a material having conductivity characteristics intermediate between conductors and insulators. Junctions between certain types of semiconductors permit electric current to flow more easily in one (1) direction than the other.

"Share of viewing hours" means the total hours that non-cable television households viewed the subject station during the week, expressed as a percentage of the total hours these households viewed all stations during the period.

"Spacing" means length of cable between amplifiers based on the amount of gain required to overcome cable losses in dB at the highest TV channel carried in the system.

"Splitter" is usually a hybrid device, consisting of an RF transformer, capacitors and resistors, that divides the signal from an input cable equally to two or more output cables.

"Stacked antenna array" means a group of identical antenna physically grouped and connected electrically for greater gain and directivity.

"Tap" means a device that diverts a small part of the TV signal energy to the subscriber's drop line, from the feeder cable.

"Television demodulator" means a television receiver designed to recover the video modulation from a television channel and make it available as an electronic signal without displaying it on a picture tube.

"Television modulator" means a low-powered television transmitter usually used in local origination.

"Terminator" means a resistive load for a coaxial cable designed to absorb the remaining energy at the end of a line eliminating reflection of energy which would appear as "ghosts." It is usually coupled through a blocking capacitor which prevents short circuiting of the cable power system.

"Tilt" means the difference in cable attenuation or amplifier gain between lower and higher frequencies on the cable system.

"Trunk line" means the main coaxial line of a CATV system which feeds signals from the head-end to the community being served.

"Trunk line amplifier" means an amplifier specifically designed for service in CATV trunk lines, usually provided with cable powering, AGC, and minimum distortion characteristics to optimize system performance in cascaded systems.
