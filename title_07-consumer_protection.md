#### 7.04.150 - Investigations.

The City Sealer shall investigate complaints made to him concerning violations of this code, and shall, upon his own initiative, conduct such investigations as he deems appropriate and advisable to develop information on prevailing procedures in commercial quantity determinations and on possible violations of the provisions of this code and to promote the general objective of accuracy on the determination and representation of quantity in commercial transactions.


#### 7.04.155 - Inspection of packages.

The City Sealer shall, from time to time, weigh or measure and inspect packages or amounts of commodities kept, offered, or exposed for sale, sold, or in the process of delivery, to determine whether the same contain the amounts represented and whether they be kept, offered, or exposed for sale, or sold, in accordance with law; and when such packages or amounts of commodities are found not to contain the amounts represented or are found to be kept, offered, or exposed for sale, or sold in violation of law, the City Sealer may order them off sale and may mark or stamp them in a manner as to show them to be "illegal." In carrying out the provisions of this section, the City Sealer may employ recognized sampling procedures under which the compliance of a given lot of packages will be determined on the basis of the result obtained on a sample selected from and representative of such lot. No person shall: (A) sell, or keep, offer, or expose for sale any package or amount of commodity that has been ordered off sale as provided in this section unless and until such package or amount of commodity has been brought into full compliance with legal requirements, or (B) dispose of any package or amount of commodity that has been ordered off sale and that has not been brought into compliance with legal requirements, in any manner except with the specific approval of the City Sealer.

The City Sealer shall approve for use and seal or mark with appropriate devices such weights and measures as he finds upon inspection and test to be "correct" as defined in Section 7.04.140, and shall reject and mark or tag as "rejected" such weights and measures as he finds, upon inspection or test, to be "incorrect" as defined in Section 7.04.140, but which in his best judgment are susceptible of satisfactory repair; provided, that the sealing or marking requirements of this section shall not be required with respect to such weights and measures as have been exempted by regulation of the City Sealer on the basis that such sealing or marking would be inappropriate, impracticable, or damaging to the apparatus in question. The City Sealer shall condemn, and may seize and may destroy, weights and measures found to be incorrect that in his best judgment are not susceptible of satisfactory repair. Weights and measures that have been rejected may be confiscated and may be destroyed by the City Sealer if not corrected as required by Section 7.04.170 or if used or disposed of contrary to the requirements of Section 7.04.170.


#### 7.04.170 - Duty of owners of incorrect apparatus.

Weights and measures that have been rejected under the authority of the City Sealer or a Deputy Sealer shall remain subject to the control of the rejecting authority until such time as suitable repair or disposition thereof has been made as required by this section.

For the purpose of this subsection "noncommercial use" means any use, other than one provided for in subsection 7.20.040.G, which is neither directly nor indirectly remunerative, and which does not involve the use of the moorage in connection with any business, whether such use is compensated or not.

### 7.20.050 - Six-month notice to remove.

### 7.20.070 - Reprisal or retaliation actions against floating home owners.

1. The owner or operator of a floating home moorage shall not take or threaten to take reprisals or retaliatory action against a floating home owner because of any good faith exercise of such floating home owner's legal rights in relation to his or her floating home.
2. "Reprisal or retaliatory action" within the meaning of this section shall mean and include but not be limited to any of the following actions by the floating home moorage owner or operator when such actions are initiated primarily because of the floating home owner's assertion or enforcement of rights or remedies provided by this chapter or any other applicable ordinance, statute, regulation or rule of law: (1) demanding removal of the floating home from its moorage site; (2) increasing the moorage fee required of the floating home owner; (3) reducing services to the floating home owner; (4) increasing the obligations of the floating home owner; and (5) otherwise interfering with the quiet enjoyment of the floating home.

### 7.20.080 - Moorage fee increases—Hearing

1. A moorage owner seeking a moorage fee increase shall give the floating home owners affected thereby a written notice, at least 30 days before the increase will go into effect, stating the amount of the increase, financial computations demonstrating the need for the increase, and the effective date of the increase. If the proposed moorage fee increase is to be based, in whole or in part, on a cost basis established by a sale, lease or other transaction concerning the moorage property or facilities, then the notice shall include identification of the parties to the transaction, all material terms of the transaction and an explanation as to whether and how the transaction resulted in a genuine change in control of the property or facilities so as to justify the use of a new cost basis.
2. If at least ½ of the floating home moorage site lessees in a floating home moorage, excluding the moorage owner and those who have an ownership interest in the moorage, who are subject to a moorage fee increase in the same percentage amount (plus or minus one percent believe that the demanded fee increase is unreasonable, they may collectively file a petition for review with the Hearing Examiner. The petition shall be in the form of a sworn statement which shall: (1) be signed by each petitioning moorage site lessee; (2) list separately the name and floating home address of each such moorage site lessee; and (3) include a statement of the intention of each moorage site lessee to contest the proposed moorage fee increase. In determining whether at least half of those affected have petitioned only one signature per moorage site will be counted. The petition shall be filed within 15 days of receipt of written notification of the moorage fee increase. The person or persons filing a petition for review shall pay a filing fee as provided in Section 3.02.125. The fee shall be refunded if no hearing is required. The Hearing Examiner may consolidate the petitions contesting moorage fee increases at the same moorage.
3. The Hearing Examiner's review shall to the extent possible be based upon written memoranda, sworn statements, and affidavits submitted by the parties. The moorage owner shall, as soon after the filing of the petition as practicable, file with the Hearing Examiner and serve upon the petitioning floating home moorage site lessees or their representative, a memorandum and any necessary affidavits or sworn statements in support of the proposed increase. The floating home moorage site lessees shall submit a responsive memorandum and affidavits within 15 days of receipt of the moorage owners' submission. The Hearing Examiner shall review the memoranda, affidavits, and sworn statements and advise the parties in writing of: (1) the legal and factual issues to be resolved; (2) the time and place for the hearing; and (3) the length of time that each party will have to present his or her case. In connection with such review the Hearing Examiner may require any party to the proceedings to provide any information needed to determine whether the demanded moorage fee increase is reasonable. Either party's failure to provide information requested by the Hearing Examiner may, at the Hearing Examiner's discretion, result in a finding or findings against the party refusing to provide the information as regards facts that could be proved or disproved by the requested information.
4. 1. The Hearing Examiner shall find whether that portion of the proposed moorage fee increase which is in excess of that permitted in Section 7.20.090, or an increase in a lesser amount, or no increase in excess of that permitted in Section 7.20.090, is necessary to assure a fair and reasonable return to the moorage owner and shall order such increase as is found necessary to assure a fair and reasonable return. In making the determination, the Hearing Examiner, in addition to any other factors deemed relevant, shall consider the following factors: (a) the purchase or lease price of the moorage and the terms of any transaction relied upon to establish the cost basis for the moorage; (b) increases or decreases since the last moorage fee increase in the expenses of operation and maintenance of the floating home moorage; provided, that such expenses are for services, repairs, property maintenance, or any other expenses which are reasonable and necessary for the continued operation of a floating home moorage; (c) the reasonable costs of capital improvements since the last moorage fee increase to the floating home moorage property which benefit the floating home owners occupying moorage sites at the floating home moorage; (d) increases or decreases since the last moorage fee increase in necessary or desirable services furnished by the floating home moorage owner or operator, where such increased or decreased services affect the person or persons initiating the fact-finding proceedings; (e) substantial deterioration since the last moorage fee increase in the facilities provided for the occupants of moorage sites at such floating home moorage due to failure of the moorage owner or operator to perform ordinary repairs, replacement and maintenance of the floating home moorage property and improvements; (f) comparability with moorage fees charges for other floating home moorage sites in the City; and (g) a reasonable return on leased land.

    1. Whenever the sale or lease price of a moorage or the terms of any transaction concerning the moorage are cited as a factor in demonstrating that a rent increase or any part thereof is necessary to assure a fair and reasonable return to the owner, the Examiner will allow sufficient time for discovery as appropriate under applicable Hearing Examiner Rules. The Hearing Examiner may rely on this factor as supporting a rent increase or any part thereof only if the moorage owner demonstrates at hearing that the sale or other transaction relied upon resulted in a genuine change in control of the moorage sufficient to justify a new cost basis for the moorage.
5. No contested moorage fee increase shall take effect until approved by the Hearing Examiner's written decision; provided that the moorage owner or operator may recover retroactively from the date of the notice of the increase, with interest at the prevailing rate for United States Treasury bills on the date of the decision, such increases as are found reasonable by the Hearing Examiner. It shall be unlawful for a moorage owner or operator to demand, charge, or collect any moorage fee in excess of the amount approved by the Hearing Examiner for a period of one year from the effective date of any permitted fee increase, unless the moorage owner can show either that extraordinary damage to the moorage occurring after the decision has necessitated cost increases which make it impossible to realize a reasonable return without a fee increase, or that the floating home owner has rented the floating home to another at a profit; provided, that moorage owners may increase fees in the amount of any increases in state lease or City license fees whenever such increases are incurred, and may increase fees for the purpose of recovering the costs of capital improvements authorized by Section 7.20.090 whenever such improvements are required. Any fee increase necessitated by extraordinary damage shall be subject to Hearing Examiner review whenever such review is requested by at least ½ of the floating home moorage site lessees affected, any other provision in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding.

### 7.20.090 - Moorage fee increase—Limit without fact-finding.

1. Moorage owners or operators shall be permitted to increase the moorage fee demanded of a floating home owner without fact-finding in an amount not exceeding: (1) the CPI factor; (2) the floating home owner's proportional share of increased state land lease fees and City street use or other permit fees incurred by the moorage owner which benefit floating home owners and result in increased operating expenses; and (3) the floating home owner's proportional share of reasonable costs to be incurred to replace substandard or defective bulkheads, floats, piling, piers and utility services; provided, that the costs of such improvements shall be recovered evenly over a period of not less than five (5) years, and such increases shall be for no longer than is reasonably required to recover the cost of such improvements, including one-half (½) of the interest on any loans to be incurred by the moorage owner to pay for the improvements. When the costs of such improvements are recovered, the moorage fee shall be reduced accordingly. Moorage fee increases attributable to the cost increases listed above may not be assessed until actually incurred. Before assessing any fee increase, moorage owners shall provide floating home owners notice of the proposed increase which shall explain the specific reasons for the increase and the apportionment formula used. When an increase is necessitated by the cost of an improvement described in subsection A3 of this section, the notice shall include a detailed description of the improvement and its useful life, and shall state the anticipated amount of the monthly increase in the floating home owner's moorage fee and the number of months that the increase will remain in effect. Within fifteen (15) days of receiving a notice of a proposed fee increase for improvements to be made pursuant to this section, the affected floating home moorage site lessees may petition the Hearing Examiner for review of the proposed increase. The petition must be signed by at least fifty percent (50%) of the floating home moorage site lessees affected by the increase and shall satisfy the petition requirements described in Section 7.20.080 B. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the procedure described in Section 7.20.080 B and C. The Hearing Examiner shall determine whether the capital improvements costs are reasonable and whether the monthly fee increases and/or amortization periods are reasonable. When the actual cost of an improvement exceeds the anticipated cost of the improvement, the moorage owner may, with the approval of fifty per cent (50%) of the affected floating home owners, increase moorage fees in an amount greater than previously approved or agreed upon, or the moorage owner may, after completion of the improvement, petition the Hearing Examiner for permission to increase fees to recover actual expenses. Any hearing requested shall be conducted pursuant to Section 7.20.080 C.
2. The CPI factor for a floating home moorage shall be determined by multiplying the percentage increase in the CPI since the last moorage fee increase by the current moorage fee, excluding from the fee any amounts assessed pursuant to subsections A2 and A3 of this section, and by multiplying the product thereof by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of square feet of land at the subject moorage owned by the moorage owner or leased from a private, nongovernmental owner and the denominator of which shall be the total number of square feet of land in the moorage (privately owned or leased land plus land leased from or licensed by any governmental entity).

### 7.20.100 - Moorage fee increase—Offer to moorage owner.

No later than seven days after submitting a petition for review pursuant to Section 7.20.080, each petitioning floating home owner shall, individually or as a group, submit to the moorage owner a written offer stating the amount of increase in the moorage fee that the floating home owner or owners believe to be reasonable. The moorage owner shall, within five days of receiving the offer, accept or reject it in writing or make a counter offer. Within three days of receiving the counter offer the floating home owner shall deliver to the moorage owner, in writing, a final offer, a photographic copy of which shall be simultaneously delivered to the Hearing Examiner. The envelope containing the photographic copy shall be clearly marked "Final Offer of Floating Home Owner" and shall indicate the name of the person or persons submitting the offer. Within three days of receiving the floating home owner's final offer the moorage owner shall deliver to the floating home owner, in writing, a final offer, a photographic copy of which shall be simultaneously delivered to the Hearing Examiner in an envelope clearly marked "Final Offer of Moorage Owner" and shall indicate the name of the person or persons submitting the offer. Any party who fails to submit a final offer in a timely fashion shall not be entitled to an award of attorney's fees. The Hearing Examiner shall not open the envelopes until after the written review decision has been provided to the parties. After mailing the decision, the Hearing Examiner shall examine the offers and shall assess reasonable attorney fees: (1) against the moorage owner or operator if the moorage fee increase permitted is equal to or less than the floating home owner's offer, or (2) against the floating home owner(s) if the permitted increase is equal to or greater than the moorage owner's offer. In all other cases each party shall bear his or her own attorney fees. The award of attorney fees shall be made in a separate decision by the Hearing Examiner. Any party who fails to pay assessed attorney fees within sixty (60) days of the Hearing Examiner's decision shall be subject to the enforcement penalties provided in Section 7.20.150.


### 7.20.110 - Moorage fee for rented houseboats.

The moorage fee for a floating home rented by its owner to another shall be one-half (½) of that portion of any profit obtained through such rental plus the moorage fee otherwise permitted for owner-occupied floating homes under Sections 7.20.080 and 7.20.090 of this chapter. Profit shall be the rental received by the floating-home owner less the floating-home owner's actual expenses, including but not limited to, the moorage fee otherwise permitted, utilities, maintenance, reasonable depreciation on investment, and one-half (½) of any interest payments. In the event of disagreement between the floating-home owner and the moorage owner as to the correct moorage fee for a site occupied by a rented houseboat then either party may apply to the Hearing Examiner for a review of the fee, and the review shall be conducted pursuant to the procedure described in Section 7.20.080 of this chapter. At all times when a floating home is rented by its owner to another, the moorage owner shall be provided a written statement of the rental rate charged the tenant by the floating-home owner, which statement shall be executed by both the floating-home owner and the tenant. The moorage owner thereafter shall be provided a copy of any rental fee increase notices given the tenant, or oral notice of such increases if written notice to the tenant is not provided. Should a floating-home owner fail to provide timely notice to the moorage owner of a rental increase, or knowingly misrepresent the amount of rent charged, the floating-home owner shall pay to the moorage owner, as an additional moorage fee, a sum equal to twice the amount of any rental increase received by the floating-home owner from the tenant from the date of the increase until the date that notice was given. When a floating-home owner occupies or reoccupies a floating home which has been rented, or when a renter of a floating home becomes its owner through purchase or otherwise, the moorage fee shall, as of the date of such occupancy or purchase, be set at the rate established for other comparably situated owner-occupied floating homes at the same moorage site, consistent with Sections 7.20.080 and 7.20.090 of this chapter.


### 7.20.120 - Voluntary waiver of provisions.

The provisions of this chapter may be waived by moorage owners and floating home owners provided that such waiver is done voluntarily and with knowledge of the waiver in a written lease and provided further that such waiver shall be valid for no longer than the term of the lease.


### 7.20.125 - City license and permit preconditions and limitations.

No floating home moorage owner or floating home owner may apply for, rely upon, use, or obtain the benefit of any City license, permit, or other approval (including but not limited to, building permits, land use permits, subdivision approvals, shoreline substantial development permits) submitted or issued in violation of the terms and requirements of Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 7.20.


### 7.20.130 - Notices.

It is unlawful to sell, lease or rent a floating home or moorage facility without advising the prospective purchaser, lessee, or renter, in writing of the existence of this chapter, and it is unlawful to fail to provide the owner or operator of a floating home moorage with written notice of a proposed change in occupancy, sale, or rental of a floating home located at the moorage at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the proposed change in occupancy.
2. It is unlawful for a moorage owner to fail to notify each floating home moorage site lessee at that moorage that the moorage is being offered for sale. This notification shall be in writing and shall be provided at least ninety (90) days but not more than one year prior to the date the moorage owner takes any action to offer the moorage for sale. Actions triggering the notice requirement of this subsection include, but are not limited to, entering into a listing agreement with respect to the moorage or advertising the moorage for sale in any public forum.
3. It is unlawful for a new moorage owner to fail to give, within seven (7) days of a change in ownership of the moorage, notice to each floating home moorage site lessee of the change of ownership and address and telephone number of the new moorage owner.

### 7.20.140 - Continuation of former provisions.

The City Council hereby declares its intention that the provisions of this chapter shall be construed and applied as a continuation of the provisions of Ordinance 109280, as amended, insofar as applicable, and the repeal of the said ordinance by this ordinance shall not be construed as affecting such continuous application.


### 7.20.150 - Violation—Penalty—Additional Remedies.

2. Alternative Criminal Penalty. Any person who violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor subject to the provisions of Chapters 12A.02 and 12A.04, except that absolute liability shall be imposed for such a violation or failure to comply, and none of the mental states described in Section 12A.04.030 need be proved. Each day a person violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter may be considered a separate violation. The City Attorney may prosecute such violation or failure to comply criminally as an alternative to the civil penalty provided by this section.
3. Additional remedies.

### 7.25.040 - Billing requirements—Submeter testing fee.

1. Notwithstanding the prohibition against submetering electric service in SMC 21.49.100.G, a landlord may, itself or through a third party billing agent, bill tenants for master metered or other unmetered utility services, including electric service provided to tenants of multi-unit buildings, provided that the following requirements are met:

    1. Notice. Billing practices may be adopted only upon advance written notice to a tenant as part of a new or renewed rental agreement. Tenants must receive such written notice at least 90 days before expiration of their rental agreements, or, in the case of month-to-month tenancies, at least 90 days before any such billing practices may become effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing two sentences, if billing practices are already in place at the time the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective, written notice must be given within 30 days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
    2. Methodology. The notice required under section A.1 above must include a copy of this chapter and a detailed written disclosure of the methodology used by the billing agent to allocate the charges to each tenant, including the methodology used to allocate utility services for common areas of the building, along with all other terms and conditions of the billing arrangement. If submetering is used, the notice required under section A.1 shall also include descriptions of the location of the submeter and of the access requirements, if any, required by the landlord for access to tenant units for submeter installation, reading, repair, maintenance, or inspections, including removal of the submeter for testing, consistent with the provisions of RCW 59.18.150 of the RLTA. An additional written notice must also be given at least 30 days prior to the due date of the next rental payment in order to implement a change in billing agents, apportionment methodology, fees, or other terms and conditions of the billing arrangement.
    3. Posting of Information.

        1. In addition to the written notification required by subsection A.2. above, any landlord employing billing practices shall post in a conspicuous public space in the interior of the building copies of the three most current utility bills for master metered or other unmetered utility services provided to the building as a whole that are included in the bill sent to the tenant, together with a written description of the methodology used to allocate each such utility service and a copy of this chapter.
        2. Where such posting is physically impracticable due to the absence of a suitable conspicuous public space, a landlord may satisfy this posting requirement by hand-delivering or mailing to tenants a paper copy of the written notification required by subsection A.2, together with a written description of the methodology used to allocate each such utility service and a copy of this chapter. In lieu of posting the three most current utility bills for master metered or other unmetered utility services provided to the building as a whole that are included in the bill sent to the tenant, the landlord must make such utility bills available upon request within five business days and must inform tenants in the written notification required by subsection A.2 of the method by which they may request such utility bills.
        3. Landlords shall keep bills for master metered or other unmetered utility services on file in the building for at least two years and shall make such bills available to tenants for inspection and copying upon request. Where it is physically impracticable to keep such bills on file due to the absence of a suitable office or other storage space, a landlord may store the bills in another location and must make such bills available within 5 business days of receiving a request from a tenant.
    4. Limitations on Charges. The total of all charges for any utility service included in the bills sent to all units cumulatively shall not exceed the amount of the bill sent by the utility itself for the building as a whole, less any late charges, interest or other penalties owed by the landlord, with the exception of the following, which may be included in each bill covering an independent unit within the multi-unit building:

        1. A service charge of no more than $2 per utility per month, not to exceed a cumulative service charge of $5 per month for all the utilities included in any bill.
        2. Late payment charges of no more than $5 per month plus interest at a rate not to exceed one percent per month, which late payment charge shall not accrue until at least 30 days after the tenant receives the bill.
        3. Insufficient funds check charges for dishonored checks, not to exceed $31 per dishonored check.
    5. Licensing of Third Party Billing Agents. Any third party billing agent must be properly registered and licensed to do business in the State of Washington and City of Seattle and must be in compliance with all applicable Washington state and Seattle laws and regulations, and all applicable Washington and Seattle license identification numbers, if any, must be disclosed upon request.
    6. Content of Bills. Each billing statement sent to a tenant by a billing entity must disclose all required information in a clear and conspicuous manner and at minimum must:

        1. Include the name, business address & telephone number of the billing entity;
        2. Identify and show the basis for each separate charge, including service charges and late charges, if any, as a line item, and show the total amount of the bill;
        3. If the building units are submetered, include the current and previous meter readings, the current read date, and the amount consumed (or estimated to have been consumed if Seattle Public Utilities or Seattle City Light has provided the landlord with an estimated bill);
        4. Specify the due date, the date upon which the bill becomes overdue, the amount of any late charges or penalties that may apply, and the date upon which such late charges or penalties may be imposed;
        5. Identify any past due dollar amounts;
        6. Identify a mailing address and telephone number for billing inquiries and disputes, identify the entity responsible for resolving billing inquiries and disputes and its business hours and days of availability, and describe the process used to resolve disputes related to bills as set forth in this chapter; and
        7. Include a statement to the effect that "this bill is from [landlord name] and not from Seattle Public Utilities or Seattle City Light."
    7. Protection of Personally Identifiable Information.

        1. A third party billing agent who prior to the effective date of this ordinance has obtained a tenant's personally identifiable information shall take such actions as are necessary to protect such personally identifiable information and to prevent its use or disclosure except as expressly permitted in this chapter.
        2. A third party billing agent who prior to the effective date of this ordinance has obtained a tenant's personally identifiable information may disclose such personally identifiable information only to the extent necessary to render its billing services.
        3. To the extent required by federal, state, or local law, a billing entity may disclose personally identifiable information in its possession (i) pursuant to a subpoena or valid court order authorizing such disclosure, or (ii) to a governmental entity.
    8. Estimated Billing. If Seattle Public Utilities or Seattle City Light has billed the landlord using an estimate of utility service consumed, the billing agent may estimate the charges to be billed to tenants until billing based on actual consumption resumes. Upon receipt of a corrected bill showing that the estimated bill overstated charges, the landlord must refund the difference to tenants. Upon receipt of a corrected bill showing that the estimated bill understated charges, the landlord may attempt to recover the underpayment from the tenants that actually incurred the charges during the billing period, but shall not attempt to recover an underpayment from a tenant who did not reside in the unit during the billing period in which the charges were incurred.
    9. Submetering. Submetering is permitted as a way of allocating master metered utility services to tenants provided the following conditions are met:

        1. The submeters must be read prior to each billing.
        2. A landlord may not enter a unit without, and a tenant may not unreasonably withhold, consent to enter the unit in order to perform submeter installation, reading, repair, maintenance, and inspection, including removal of the submeter for testing, provided, however, that a landlord may enter a unit without a tenant's consent in the case of a submeter leak or emergency related to that unit's submeter.
        3. The accuracy tolerance for the maximum flow rate shall be within 1.5-percent for all submeter types. The accuracy tolerance for the minimum flow rate shall be within 3-percent for Multi-jet submeter types, and within a 1.5-percent over-registration and a 5-percent under-registration for other than Multi-jet submeter types.

            1. If a tenant contests the accuracy of the submeter, the tenant shall have the option of demanding that the City of Seattle provide an independent test of the meter through the Department of Finance and Administrative Services. If the meter reads within these ranges of accuracy, the tenant requesting the test shall pay the meter test fee. If the meter reads outside these ranges of accuracy, the landlord shall pay the meter test fee and within 30 days refund any overpayments for the past three months based on a recalculation of the past year's billings by correcting for the inaccuracy of the submeter. Submetering thereafter shall only be permitted with a repaired submeter.
            2. The meter test fee for each test of a submeter pursuant to this subsection shall be $65.
2. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a landlord from addressing billing of master metered or other unmetered utility services in a written addendum to a lease. A lease addendum may be used to give the notice required under subsection A.1 of this subsection, so long as the lease addendum is provided to the tenant with the notice required under that subsection, and so long as all other requirements of this chapter are satisfied.

### 7.25.050 - Dispute resolution and remedies.

1. A dispute regarding the amount of charges or other terms and conditions contained in a bill shall be resolved as follows:

    1. The tenant must notify the entity responsible for billing disputes as identified in the bill ("Responsible Entity") of the nature of and reason for the dispute by calling the number shown on the bill or by writing a letter to the Responsible Entity within 30 days of receiving the bill. The tenant must have a good faith basis for any such dispute.
    2. Within 30 days of receiving notice of a billing dispute, the Responsible Entity must contact the tenant to discuss the dispute, and the Responsible Entity and tenant must determine the amount of disputed and undisputed charges. The tenant must pay all undisputed charges within 30 days of reaching agreement with the Responsible Entity.
    3. No late fees or interest charges shall accrue on any disputed portions of a bill while the amount is being resolved in accordance with subsections A.1 and 2, and no collection activity related to the disputed portions of a bill may be instituted against a tenant that has notified the Responsible Entity of a dispute in accordance with this chapter.
    4. The tenant and Responsible Entity shall continue to discuss in good faith any remaining disputed amounts and attempt to reach an agreement on the amount due, if any, within 60 days of the Responsible Entity's receipt of notice of a billing dispute. If a tenant is unable to reach a satisfactory resolution of any portion of a disputed charge within the allotted time, the tenant may exercise any of the remedies set forth in Section B below or any other available remedies, provided, however, that if within 120 days of the Responsible Entity's receipt of notice of a billing dispute, the tenant has not either exercised one of the remedies set forth in Section B or paid the remaining disputed amounts, the landlord may exercise any legal or equitable remedies available to it to collect the unpaid amounts, and provided further that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to deprive a landlord of its right to exercise any legal or equitable remedies available to it against a tenant that has not paid any undisputed charges, has not followed the procedures set forth in this section, or has not exercised good faith in disputing a charge.
2. If a tenant believes that it has been or will be subject to billing practices that violate any provision set forth in this chapter, the tenant may, at its option, file a complaint against the landlord with the Office of the Hearing Examiner or institute a civil action against the landlord, as follows:

    1. The Office of the Hearing Examiner is hereby vested with the authority to hear and resolve tenant complaints against landlords regarding billing practices in accordance with its rules and procedures then in force governing contested cases. The filing fee for such a case shall be set at $5.00. Upon the finding of a violation of this chapter, the Hearing Examiner shall award actual damages (including but not limited to refund of any overpayment or other fees or charges resulting from such violation, and costs of pursuing the claim) and a penalty of one hundred dollars, and may permit the tenant to terminate the rental agreement by written notice in accordance with RCW 59.18.090. If the Hearing Examiner determines that the landlord engaged in prohibited billing practices in deliberate violation of this chapter, the penalty mentioned in the preceding sentence shall be two hundred dollars, and the Hearing Examiner shall also award attorneys' fees to the tenant. A final order or decision of the Hearing Examiner may be subject to judicial review in the King County Superior Court in accordance with the Hearing Examiner's rules and procedures.
    2. In the alternative, a tenant may institute a civil action against the landlord. Upon a finding that a landlord engaged in billing practices that violate this chapter, the court shall award actual damages (including but not limited to refund of any overpayment or other fees or charges resulting from such violation, and costs of pursuing the claim) and a penalty of one hundred dollars, and may permit the tenant to terminate the rental agreement by written notice in accordance with RCW 59.18.090. If the court determines that the landlord engaged in prohibited billing practices in deliberate violation of this chapter, the penalty mentioned in the preceding sentence shall be two hundred dollars, and the court shall also award attorneys' fees to the tenant.
    3. No late fees or interest charges shall accrue on any disputed portions of a bill while the amount is being resolved by the Hearing Examiner or court, and no collection activity or unlawful detainer action alleging default in the payment of rent related to the disputed portions of a bill may be instituted against a tenant that has filed a complaint with the Hearing Examiner or instituted a civil action in accordance with this chapter while the amount is being resolved by the Hearing Examiner or court. If the Hearing Examiner or court resolves the dispute and finds that a tenant that has not acted in good faith in asserting a billing dispute, the Hearing Examiner or court may order the tenant to pay late fees and/or interest charges on some or all of the disputed portions of the bill.
    4. A landlord shall not pass on, charge, or otherwise allocate to tenants, in any manner whatsoever, any damages, fine or penalty (including attorneys' fees) that the landlord is ordered to pay under this chapter.
3. The existence of an unresolved or pending billing dispute does not relieve a tenant of its obligation to pay in a timely fashion all undisputed charges, including those undisputed charges that accrue after the dispute resolution procedures of this chapter have been invoked.

This term does not include any charge, fee, or other consideration usually charged or imposed by the facilitator in the ordinary course of business, such as fees for tax return preparation and fees for electronic filing of tax returns, if the same fees in the same amount are charged to the facilitator's customers who do not use Bank Products.
4. "Disclosure" means complete and accurate information, presented in a clear, concise, and understandable manner in all written and oral notices, documents, and explanations required under this chapter.
5.

### 7.26.040 - Required disclosures and practices.

1. As set forth more specifically in subsections B through F of this section, if a facilitator offers to make or facilitate a Bank Product for the taxpayer, the facilitator must explain that the taxpayer has a choice of methods for receiving a tax refund, must first disclose the availability and timing of receiving a refund directly from the IRS without using a Bank Product before describing any available Bank Products, and must provide clear, complete, and accurate information about each available option, including receiving a refund directly from the IRS.
2. Before or at the same time that the facilitator first mentions or offers a Bank Product to the taxpayer, the facilitator must provide (i) the following disclosures, or disclosures substantially similar in form, content, and scope, for receiving a refund directly from the IRS without incurring fees (other than tax preparation and filing fees); (ii) for each Bank Product offered, the following specific disclosures, or disclosures substantially similar in form, content, and scope, and (iii) if RALs are offered, examples of the APR for RALs of five hundred dollars ($500.00), one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), two thousand dollars ($2,000.00), and five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) (or at least four other representative loan amounts) as if those loans were made on the same terms as the loan offered to the taxpayer. The required disclosures must be made in writing, separate from any other document or writing, double-spaced, in at least 14-point type, with the heading "Options for Receiving your Refund" or a substantially similar heading. The facilitator must offer the taxpayer the choice of English and Spanish language written versions of the disclosures; and must simultaneously provide a point-by-point oral explanation of the disclosures in English or Spanish as appropriate, or in a language understood by the taxpayer in the event that the taxpayer does not understand the disclosures in English or Spanish (which may be provided using a translator provided by the taxpayer).

IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AN INCOME TAX REFUND, YOU MAY CHOOSE HOW YOU FILE YOUR RETURN AND RECEIVE YOUR REFUND.

IF YOU FILE YOUR TAX RETURN ELECTRONICALLY AND THE IRS APPROVES YOUR REFUND, THE IRS WILL USUALLY DIRECT DEPOSIT YOUR REFUND INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT WITHIN ABOUT TWO WEEKS [or such other time as the IRS may announce for a direct deposited refund from an e-filed return], OR WILL SEND YOU A CHECK THROUGH THE MAIL WITHIN ABOUT THREE WEEKS [or such other time as the IRS may announce for a mailed refund from an e-filed return].

IF YOU MAIL YOUR TAX RETURN TO THE IRS AND THE IRS APPROVES YOUR REFUND, THE IRS WILL USUALLY DIRECT DEPOSIT YOUR REFUND INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT WITHIN ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN WEEKS [or such other time as the IRS may announce for direct deposited refund from an e-filed return], OR WILL SEND YOU A CHECK THROUGH THE MAIL WITHIN ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS [or such other time as the IRS may announce for a mailed refund from an e-filed return].

[]

IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT TO RECEIVE A DIRECT DEPOSIT, YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER OPENING ONE. WE CAN OPEN A TEMPORARY BANK ACCOUNT FOR YOU AND HELP YOU GET A "REFUND ANTICIPATION CHECK" IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS AFTER YOU FILE ELECTRONICALLY IF THE IRS APPROVES YOUR REFUND, BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO QUALIFY AND YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY A FEE OF [$$] TO US AND [$$] TO THE BANK.

[]

YOU MAY ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A "REFUND ANTICIPATION LOAN," BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO QUALIFY AND YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY A FEE OF [$$] TO US AND [$$] TO THE BANK. IF YOU ARE APPROVED AND YOU DECIDE TO PROCEED, YOU WILL BE TAKING OUT A LOAN THAT MUST BE PAID BACK WITH INTEREST. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAYING THE ENTIRE LOAN AMOUNT AND ALL RELATED COSTS, FEES, AND INTEREST, REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH MONEY YOU ACTUALLY RECEIVE FROM THE IRS IN YOUR TAX REFUND. THIS MEANS THAT IF THE IRS REDUCES OR DENIES YOUR REFUND, YOU WILL STILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAYING THE ENTIRE LOAN AMOUNT AND ALL RELATED COSTS AND FEES.

3. In addition to the disclosures required under Subsection B, at the time that the taxpayer asks to apply for a Bank Product (or, in the case of Bank Products facilitated by a tax preparer, the sooner of (i) the time the taxpayer asks to apply or (ii) the time the tax preparer determines that the taxpayer may be eligible for a refund and offers the taxpayer a Bank Product), the facilitator must provide the following disclosures, or disclosures substantially similar in form, content, and scope for all Bank Products offered. The foregoing disclosures must be made in writing, separate from any other document or writing, double-spaced, in at least 14-point type. The facilitator must offer the taxpayer the choice of English and Spanish language written versions of the disclosures; and must simultaneously provide a point-by-point oral explanation of the disclosures in English or Spanish as appropriate, or in a language understood by the taxpayer in the event that the taxpayer does not understand the disclosures in English or Spanish (which may be provided using a translator provided by the taxpayer).

[]

YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO THIS REFUND ANTICIPATION LOAN AGREEMENT MERELY BECAUSE YOU HAVE RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION. YOU CAN STILL OBTAIN OUR SERVICES AND/OR PRODUCTS EVEN IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO ENTER INTO THIS REFUND ANTICIPATION LOAN AGREEMENT, OR IF YOUR APPLICATION IS DENIED.

IF YOU DO APPLY FOR A REFUND ANTICIPATION LOAN AND YOUR LOAN IS APPROVED, YOU WILL BE TAKING OUT A LOAN THAT MUST BE PAID BACK WITH INTEREST. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAYING THE ENTIRE LOAN AMOUNT AND ALL RELATED COSTS, FEES, AND INTEREST, REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH MONEY YOU ACTUALLY RECEIVE IN YOUR TAX REFUND. THIS MEANS THAT IF THE IRS REDUCES OR DENIES YOUR REFUND, YOU WILL STILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAYING THE ENTIRE LOAN AMOUNT AND ALL RELATED COSTS AND FEES.

IF YOUR REFUND ANTICIPATION LOAN IS APPROVED, YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO PAY $[insert itemized amount] IN FEES, INTEREST, AND OTHER CHARGES FOR THE LOAN, WHICH WE WILL AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCT. AFTER WE DEDUCT THESE FEES, INTEREST, AND OTHER CHARGES FROM YOUR LOAN, YOU WILL RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY $ [insert amount].

THE INTEREST RATE ("APR") OF YOUR REFUND ANTICIPATION LOAN IS [insert percentage as defined in Subsection 7.26.020(H)]. THIS IS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF TIME YOU WILL BE LENT MONEY THROUGH THIS REFUND ANTICIPATION LOAN. IF THE IRS DELAYS YOUR REFUND, YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY ADDITIONAL INTEREST.

IF YOU DO TAKE OUT THIS REFUND ANTICIPATION LOAN, YOU CAN EXPECT TO RECEIVE YOUR LOAN WITHIN APPROXIMATELY TWO DAYS OF ELECTRONICALLY FILING YOUR RETURN, AND YOU WILL BEGIN OWING INTEREST AS OF THAT DATE.

[]

YOU ARE PAYING [insert Bank Product Fee for RAC as defined in Section 7.26.020(C)] TO GET YOUR REFUND VIA A BANK CHECK FROM [insert name of RAC issuer]. YOU CAN AVOID THIS FEE AND STILL RECEIVE YOUR REFUND WITHIN APPROXIMATELY TWO WEEKS BY HAVING THE IRS DIRECT DEPOSIT YOUR REFUND INTO YOUR OWN BANK ACCOUNT, OR WITHIN ABOUT THREE WEEKS IF THE IRS MAILS YOU A CHECK.

[]

YOU ARE BEING OFFERED "ASSISTED DIRECT DEPOSIT," WHICH MEANS THAT YOUR REFUND WILL BE DEPOSITED IN AN ACCOUNT CREATED BY (insert name of Lender). FEES FOR OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND FOR THE ASSISTED DIRECT DEPOSIT WILL BE DEDUCTED AND THE REMAINING BALANCE WILL THEN BE TRANSFERRED TO YOUR ACCOUNT. THE TOTAL FEES FOR THIS SERVICE ARE [insert Bank Product Fee as defined in Section 7.26.020(C)] IN ADDITION TO THE FEES FOR OTHER SERVICES AND PRODUCTS THAT WE ARE CHARGING YOU.

4. Before the facilitator allows the taxpayer to enter into a Bank Product arrangement, the facilitator must (i) complete the disclosures required under Subsection C accurately with all relevant information for each taxpayer, (ii) provide the required point-by-point oral explanation in English, Spanish, or other language understood by the taxpayer (which may be provided using a translator provided by the taxpayer), and (iii) complete all blanks in the disclosure form and, only after all blanks are filled, have the form signed and dated by the taxpayer and the facilitator. The facilitator must provide the taxpayer with a copy of the signed disclosures, and must keep a copy of the signed disclosures on file with the taxpayer's records (e.g., tax return or other records of service) in accordance with the facilitator's usual retention procedures.
