#### 10.08.135 - Purpose.

The purpose of Sections 10.08.140 through 10.08.178 is to encourage security alarm users and security alarm monitoring companies to maintain the operational reliability and the proper use of alarm systems in order to reduce unnecessary police responses to false alarms and to require in-person or other independent verification before responding to emergency calls at premises where an automatic property and/or automatic burglary alarm system has a record of unreliability.

The express purpose of this chapter is to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not to protect individuals or create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially affected by the terms of this chapter. This chapter imposes or creates no duties on the part of the City or any of its departments, and the obligation of complying with the requirements of this chapter, and any liability for failing to do so, is placed upon the parties responsible for owning, operating, monitoring or maintaining automatic alarm systems.


#### 10.08.140 - Definitions.

4. "Alarm user class" means a class provided by the Alarm Unit of the Seattle Police Department for the purpose of educating alarm users about false alarms.
5. Burglary alarm. See "Property alarm" below.

    1. There is no evidence of a crime or other activity that warrants the assistance of the Seattle Police Department on the premises, as indicated by the investigation of a police officer on the scene or by the lack of a police report filed by the property owner, and no individual who was on or near the premises or who had viewed a video communication from the premises, called for the dispatch or confirmed a need for police response; or
    2. The dispatch of police personnel was cancelled by the alarm system monitoring company, whether the alarm was cancelled before or after the arrival of police personnel at the alarm site.

    4. It is intended to summon police assistance to the premises.
15. Verification. See Section 10.08.165.

#### 10.08.145 - Audible alarm standards.

On or after September 1, 1993, no automatic property or burglary alarm which, when activated, causes an audible sound to be heard off the premises continuously for more than ten (10) minutes shall be installed on privately-owned premises in Seattle.

Owners of existing automatic property or burglary alarms which, when activated, sound continuously until turned off and send audible sounds off the premises are encouraged to limit the duration of the sound to ten (10) minutes or less by such methods as installing an automatic shutoff mechanism, connecting to a monitoring system, or converting to more modern equipment.

Nothing in this section shall limit the duration of a fire or other evacuation alarm during a bona fide emergency when the sound may assist in saving life or avoiding injury.


#### 10.08.150 - Notice—Alarm turnoff.

It is a defense that the continuous sounding of the alarm assisted in saving life or avoiding injury in a bona fide emergency.

It is a mitigating circumstance that the alarm was caused by a malfunction of the equipment without prior knowledge of the owner, or activated by an unauthorized entry or by criminal activity.


#### 10.08.160 - Unlawful activation or report of alarm.

No person shall activate any robbery, panic, property, or burglary alarm for the purpose of summoning police except in the event of an unauthorized entry, robbery or other crime being committed or attempted on the premises, or the user needs immediate assistance in order to avoid injury or serious bodily harm.

Anyone who shall notify the police of an activated alarm and have knowledge that such activation was apparently caused by an electrical or other malfunction of the alarm system, shall at the same time notify the police of such apparent malfunction.


#### 10.08.165 - Alarm system monitoring companies—Verification process.

Every alarm system monitoring company engaged in business activities in Seattle shall:

A verification process is an independent method of determining that a signal from an automatic alarm system reflects a need for police assistance or investigation. The means of verification shall include one or more of the following:


1. An attempt by the alarm system monitoring company, or its representative, to contact the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request. For the purpose of this ordinance, telephone verification shall require, as a minimum, that a second call be made to a different number if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify themselves to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch;
2. A feature that permits the alarm system user or a person authorized by the user to send a cancellation code to the alarm system monitoring company that will cancel an alarm immediately after it has been sent and prevent the monitoring company calling for a police dispatch;
3. The installation of a video system that provides the alarm system monitoring company when the signal is received with the ability to ascertain that activity is occurring which warrants police assistance or investigation;
4. An independent confirmation that a signal reflects a need for police assistance or investigation either by the alarm system user, a person at or near the premises, or an alternate response agency made before dispatching police; or
5. An alternate system that the Chief determines has or is likely to have a high degree of reliability.

1. Obtain a City of Seattle alarm system monitoring company license from the Department of Finance and Administrative Services as provided in SMC Chapter 6.10;
2. Provide the Chief of Police such information about the nature of its property alarms, burglary alarms, robbery alarms, and panic alarms; its method of monitoring; its program for preventing false alarms; and its method of disconnecting audible alarms, each as the Chief may require by rule adopted pursuant to Chapter 3.02;
3. Maintain a current list of all subscribers' names and the associated protected premises it serves, which list shall be given to the Director on a quarterly basis;
4. Verify with those subscribers who have an automatic alarm system, each alarm signal that has been accepted by the alarm system monitoring company using a verification process to prevent false alarms from resulting in unnecessary police dispatches.
5. When the Chief reports that there appears to have been a false alarm at a subscriber's premises, work cooperatively with the subscriber and the Chief in order to determine the cause thereof and prevent recurrences.

#### 10.08.168 - Determination—Rebuttable presumption.

For the purposes of this subchapter, there is a rebuttable presumption that the following determinations made by the Chief of Police, or made on behalf of the Chief by a police officer dispatched to the premises, are correct:


1. There is no evidence of a crime or other activity that would warrant a call for police assistance or police investigation at the premises; and
2. No individual who was on or near the premises, or who had viewed a video communication from the premises, called for the dispatch or verified a need for police response.

#### 10.08.178 - Frequent false alarms—Process for disregarding automatic alarms—In-person verification.

The Chief may consider such a call as an additional factor in making his or her decision to order a dispatch when an in-person verification from an individual at the premises, or other independent evidence, shows a need for police assistance at the premises.


1. In exercising his or her discretion to make a dispatch in response to an automatic property or automatic burglary alarm, the Chief of Police may disregard a call for dispatch when:

    1. The call comes from or is prompted by an automatic property alarm or automatic burglary alarm that has a record of sending six (6) false alarms within a period of twelve (12) months; and
    2. The call is the only basis for making such a dispatch.
2. To discourage false alarms, the Chief may adopt a process of sending a letter by regular mail informing the alarm system monitoring company of record of the false alarm history, the need to take corrective action, and the prospect that six (6) false alarms within a twelve (12) month period shall result in the automatic signals being disregarded and an in-person verification being required or other independent information showing a need for such a dispatch before a dispatch will be made to the premises.
3. Before acting as authorized in subsection A of this section, the Chief shall send or deliver a notice to the alarm system monitoring company that:

    1. Six (6) false alarms have been received within a twelve (12) month period;
    2. The remedy authorized in subsection A may be taken;
    3. The alarm system monitoring company may request a hearing before the Chief or his designee and explain why the Chief should not take the proposed action; if no hearing is requested, the Seattle Police Department will after ten (10) days disregard automatic signals from the premises without a verification from an individual or other independent information showing a need for such dispatch; and
    4. A requirement of an in-person communication or verification may remain in effect for a period of three hundred sixty-five (365) days.
4. If a hearing is requested, the Chief shall schedule the hearing within ten (10) days. Both the alarm user and a representative from the alarm system monitoring company are required to attend. The Chief may take into consideration such factors as the steps that the alarm system user or alarm system monitoring company has taken or is taking to correct the problem; the incidence of crime in the area; the facts and circumstances of the false alarms; and other relevant information presented by the user or the monitoring company.
5. The Chief may suspend or cancel the remedy under subsection A if he or she determines that the automatic alarm system has been corrected to prevent the recurrence of false alarms.
6. "Dispatch" means a discretionary decision whether to direct police units to a location where there has been a report made, by whatever means, that police assistance or investigation is needed. There is no duty to dispatch under any circumstances whatever, whether automatic alarms are involved or not, and all dispatch decisions are made subject to competing priorities and available police response resources.

#### 10.08.180 - Violation—Civil penalties.

1. The failure of an alarm system monitoring company that engages in business activities in Seattle to comply with any of the requirements of Section 10.08.165 shall be a civil infraction as contemplated by RCW Chapter 7.80 and subject as a Class 1 civil infraction under RCW 7.80.120(2) to a maximum monetary penalty and a default amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) plus statutory assessments. With respect to Subsections A, B, C, and E of Section 10.08.165, each day of noncompliance shall be a separate violation, and the monetary penalties shall accumulate. With respect to Subsection D of Section 10.08.165, each failure to verify an alarm signal that has been accepted by the alarm system monitoring company and results in a false alarm, shall be a separate violation.
2. The violation of or failure to comply with any other provisions of this subchapter shall be a civil infraction as contemplated by RCW Chapter 7.80 and subject as a Class 1 civil infraction under RCW 7.80.120(c) to a maximum penalty and a default amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250) plus statutory assessments.
3. There shall be a maximum penalty and default amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250) plus statutory assessments as contemplated by RCW 7.80.160(3), for a failure to pay a penalty imposed pursuant to subsection A or B.

#### 10.16.080 - Cows—Health.

1. All milk for pasteurization shall be from herds which are located in a modified accredited tuberculosis-free area, as determined by the Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture, and which have been tested for tuberculosis not more than six (6) years prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter and at least every six (6) years after such test; provided, that herds located in an area that fails to maintain such accredited status, or that has an incidence of bovine tuberculosis in excess of 0.2 percent shall have been accredited by the Bureau of Animal Industry as tuberculosis-free, or shall have passed an annual tuberculin test. All additions to such herds shall be free from tuberculosis. In the case of milk not for pasteurization, all herds and additions thereto shall be tested and found free of tuberculosis before any milk therefrom is sold, and all herds shall be retested at least every twelve (12) months thereafter. The tests and retests shall be made, and any reactors disposed of, in accordance with the latest requirements approved by the Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture, for tuberculosis-free, accredited herds, in effect at the time of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. A certificate identifying each animal, signed by the veterinarian or attested to by the Director, and filed as directed by the Director, shall be evidence of the test specified in this subsection.
2. It shall be unlawful to sell, offer or expose for sale any fluid milk or cream designated or represented to be "Grade A" fluid milk or cream with knowledge that such milk or cream has been produced from a herd of cows or goats, one or more of which are infected with brucellosis at the time such milk was produced, or with knowledge that all animals in such herd have not been blood-tested for brucellosis at least once during the preceding calendar year or milk-ring-tested for brucellosis at least semiannually during the preceding calendar year. The results of a test for brucellosis by the State or Federal Laboratory of a blood sample drawn by an official veterinarian, shall be prima facie evidence of the infection or noninfection of an animal or herds, or in lieu thereof two (2) official negative milk-ring tests for brucellosis not less than six (6) months apart may be accepted as such evidence.
3. All herds of cows or goats shall be blood-tested for brucellosis annually or milk-ring-tested for brucellosis semiannually. All herds showing any reaction to the milk-ring test must be blood-tested and all reactors to the blood test must be removed from the herd and disposed of within fifteen (15) days from the date they are tagged and branded. The remaining animals in the infected herd shall be retested at not less than thirty (30) day nor more than sixty (60) day intervals from date of the first test. A series of retests, with removal and slaughter of reacting animals, shall be continued until the herd shall have passed two (2) successive negative tests, at the above-mentioned interval, computed from succeeding tests in which no reactors are found. If upon a final test, not less than six (6) months nor more than seven (7) months from the date of the last negative test, no reactors are found in the herd, it shall be deemed a disease-free herd. In the case of milk not for pasteurization, all herds and additions thereto shall be tested and found free of brucellosis before any milk therefrom is sold, and all herds shall be retested at least every twelve (12) months thereafter. Reactors are those animals classified as such by existing or subsequently amended state and federal regulations, copies of which are on file in the City Clerk's Office under Comptroller's File No. 222274. Results of official blood and milk-ring tests shall be conspicuously displayed in the milk house.
4. Cows which show a complete induration of one-quarter (¼) or extensive induration in one (1) or more quarters of the udder upon physical examination, whether secreting abnormal milk or not, shall be permanently excluded from the milking herd; provided, that this shall not apply in the case of a quarter that is completely dry. Cows giving bloody, stringy, or otherwise abnormal milk, but without entire or extensive induration of the udder, shall be excluded from the herd until re-examination shows that the milk has become normal.
5. For other diseases, such tests and examinations as the Director may require after consultation with State Livestock Sanitary Officials shall be made at intervals and by methods prescribed by him, and any diseased animals or reactors shall be disposed of as he may require.
