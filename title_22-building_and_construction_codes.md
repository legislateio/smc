    3. Fees. A fee for each grading permit and for other activities related to the enforcement of this code shall be paid as set forth in the Fee Subtitle (SMC Chapters 22.900A-22.900G).

#### 22.170.075 - Code Modifications

1. Grading Code modifications. The Director, upon the request of the applicant, may modify the requirements of this code for individual cases if the Director finds: (1) there are unusual practical difficulties involved in complying with the provisions of this code; (2) the modification is appropriate to mitigate the practical difficulties, and (3) the modification is in substantial conformity with the intent and purposes of this code when considered together with the characteristics of the site and other relevant circumstances. The Director may, but is not required to, record the approval of modifications and any relevant information in the files of the Director or on the approved permit plans.
2. Modifications of other codes. Nothing in this Section 22.170.075 or any other provision of this code authorizes modifications of requirements of the Stormwater Code, regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas, or any other codes, ordinances or regulations.

#### 22.170.080 - Financial Assurance and Covenants

As a condition precedent to issuance of any grading permit provided for in this code, the Director may require an applicant to submit financial assurances and a covenant as provided in this Section 22.170.080.


1. Insurance.

    1. The Director may require the owner(s) or contractor to carry liability and property damage insurance against bodily injury, death, disability, property damage and/or loss from or related to land disturbing activities or resulting conditions, or operation of equipment on or about the property, naming the City as an additional insured, covering any occurrence prior to determination by the Director that the requirements of the grading permit have been met. The amount and policy terms shall be commensurate with the risks as determined by the Director. The Director may require proof that the insurance is in effect prior to issuance of a grading permit.
    2. The Director may also require the owner(s) to maintain a policy of general public liability insurance against personal injury, death, property damage and/or loss from activities conducted pursuant to the grading permit, or conditions caused by grading activities, and naming the City as an additional insured. The policy shall be in an amount and on terms that the Director determines to be commensurate with the risks. It shall cover a period of not more than ten years from the date of issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or finalization of the grading permit. A certificate evidencing the insurance shall be filed with the Director before issuance of a grading permit.
    3. The insurance policy shall provide that the City will be notified of cancellation of the policy at least 30 days prior to cancellation. The notice shall be sent to the Director and shall state the insured's name and the property address. If a property owner's insurance is canceled and not replaced ten days prior to a lapse in coverage, the Director may order that any further work under a grading permit stop, or issue a notice of violation, or the grading permit and any interrelated permit or approval may be revoked, including a Certificate of Occupancy or approval for occupancy.
2. Bonds, Cash Deposits or Instruments of Credit.

    1. The Director may require that the owner or contractor deliver to the Director a surety bond, cash deposit or an instrument of credit in a form and amount deemed by the Director to be necessary to ensure that requirements of the grading permit are met. Surety bonds shall be furnished by a surety company licensed to do business in the State of Washington. The bond shall be conditioned that the work will be completed in accordance with the conditions of the grading permit, or, if the work is not completed, that the site will be left in a safe condition and that erosion control measures will be in place. The bond shall also be conditioned that the site and nearby, adjacent and surrounding areas will be restored if damaged or made unsafe by activities conducted pursuant to the grading permit.
    2. The bond will be exonerated, or other security released, not more than one year after a determination by the Director that the requirements of the grading permit have been met. For work under a building permit, issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or approval for occupancy following a final inspection shall be considered to be such a determination. For work under a separate grading permit, the Director's approval after completion of the final grading inspection and submittal of all required reports shall be such a determination.
3. Covenants.

    1. The Director may require a covenant between the owner(s) of the property and the City prior to issuance of any permit or approval in a potential landslide area, potentially hazardous location, flood prone zone, or other area of potentially hazardous soils or drainage or erosion conditions. The covenant shall not be required where the permit or approval is for work done by the City. The covenant shall be tailored to the specific types of risks presented, shall be signed by the owner(s) of the property, shall be notarized, shall run with the land and shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:

        1. A legal description of the property;
        2. A description of the property condition making this subsection 22.170.080.C applicable;
        3. As relevant to the property condition, commitment by the owner to maintain features of the site in such condition and such manner as will prevent harm to the public, to residents of the property, to nearby property, to streets, alleys and drainage facilities, from the activities to be done pursuant to the permit and from the related changes to the site, and to indemnify the City and its officers, employees, contractors and agents from any claims arising from the failure of the owner to comply with the commitment;
        4. A statement that the owner(s) of the property understands and accepts the responsibility for the risks associated with development on the property given the described condition, and agrees to inform future purchasers and other successors and assignees of the risks;
        5. The application date, type, and number of the permit or approval for which the covenant is required; and
        6. A waiver and release of any right of the owner(s), the owner's heirs, successors and assigns to assert any claim against the City and its officers, employees, contractors and agents by reason of or arising out of issuance of the permit or approval by the City for the development on the property, or arising out of any inspection, statement, assurance, delay, act or omission by or on behalf of the City related to the permit or approval or the work done thereunder, and agreeing to defend and indemnify the City and its officers, employees, contractors and agents for any liability, claim or demand arising out of any of the foregoing or out of work done or omitted by or for the owner, except in each case only for such losses, claims or demands that directly result from the sole negligence of the City.
    2. The covenant shall be recorded by the Director with the King County Recorder's Office, at the expense of the owner, so as to become part of the King County real property records.
4. Bonds for Grading Near Public Places. Security for grading activity covered under Section 15.44.020 shall be in accordance with Section 15.44.030.

#### 22.170.090 - Grading Permit Application Referral and Consultation

The Director may refer applications for grading permits, including plans and other required information and reports, to, and may consult with, other agencies or City departments as may be appropriate. Comments and recommendations received shall be considered by the Director in making a decision regarding the grading application.


#### 22.170.100 - Cancellation of Grading Permit Applications

1. Applicability of codes. Subsections 22.170.100.B through 22.170.100.D apply to applications for grading permits that are not components of building permits. Cancellation of grading permit components of building permit applications shall be done pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Seattle Building Code or the Seattle Residential Code.
2. Grounds for Cancellation. Applications may be cancelled if no permit is issued by the earlier of the following: (1) 12 months following the date of application; or (2) 60 days from the date of written notice that the permit is ready to be issued. After cancellation, plans and other data submitted for review may be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the Director.
3. Notice of Cancellation. The Director will notify the applicant in writing at least 30 days before the application is cancelled. The notice shall specify a date by which a request for extension must be submitted in order to avoid cancellation. The date shall be no more than two weeks prior to the date on which the application will be cancelled.
4. Inspection After Cancellation. If the application is canceled, the site may be inspected to verify that no work has taken place.

#### 22.170.110 - Granting or denial of grading permits

1. Granting

    1. If the Director finds that an application for a grading permit complies with the requirements of this code and rules promulgated hereunder, that the fees specified in the Fee Subtitle have been paid, and that the applicant has satisfied all other conditions precedent imposed by or pursuant to this code, the Stormwater Code, and rules promulgated under those codes, the Director shall issue a permit to the applicant. A permit may be granted with or without conditions. Conditions may include, but are not limited to: restricting grading work to specific seasons, months or weather conditions; limiting vegetation removal; sequencing of work; requiring that recommendations contained in the geotechnical investigation are followed; requiring observation by a licensed civil or geotechnical engineer; requiring special inspection pursuant to Section 22.170.130; requiring structural safeguards; specifying methods of erosion, sedimentation, and drainage control; specifying methods for maintenance of slope stability; retaining existing trees; requiring revegetation and grass seeding and/or long term maintenance activities; requiring compliance with Chapter 25.09, Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas, Chapter 23.60A, Shoreline Master Program, and other regulations of the City or other agencies with jurisdiction.
    2. The Director may require that plans and specifications be stamped and signed by a licensed civil engineer or geotechnical engineer to indicate that the grading and proposed structure comply with the conclusions and recommendations of any required investigation or report.
2. Denial. The application for grading permit may be denied if the Director determines that the plans or proposed activity do not comply with the requirements of this code and rules promulgated hereunder, or do not accomplish the purposes of this code, or the grading or other land disturbing activity is inconsistent with the proposed development on the site, or the plans or other proposed activity do not comply with other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, or that the applicant has failed to satisfy any condition precedent to issuance of the permit imposed by or pursuant to this code, the Stormwater Code or rules promulgated under either code.
3. Limitations. The issuance or granting of a grading permit shall not be construed to be permission for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this code or rules promulgated hereunder, or of any other law or regulation. A grading permit does not remove the need to obtain any other permit or approval required under any other law, ordinance or regulation.

#### 22.170.120 - Expiration and renewal of grading permit

1. Applicability of codes. Subsections 22.170.120.B through 22.170.120.D apply to applications for grading permits that are not components of building permits. Expiration and renewal of grading components of building permits shall occur pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Seattle Building Code or the Seattle Residential Code.
2. Expiration. Authority to do the work authorized by a grading permit expires 18 months from the date of issuance unless otherwise stated in the permit. Where advisable to satisfy the requirements or purposes of this code, the Director may issue nonrenewable grading permits that expire less than 18 months from date of issuance. Requirements of this code and conditions included in any permit do not terminate with the expiration of the grading permit unless they are explicitly identified as temporary for the duration of grading operations.
3. Renewal or Extension

    1. Unless otherwise stated in the permit, a grading permit may be renewed once for up to 18 additional months if the following conditions are met:

        1. Application for renewal is made within the 30-day period immediately preceding the date of expiration of the permit; and
        2. If the project has had an associated discretionary Land Use review, the land use approval has not expired; and
        3. If an application for renewal is made more than 18 months after the date of mandatory compliance with a new or revised edition of this code, the Seattle Building Code or Residential Code, the permit shall not be renewed unless:

            1. The Director determines that the permit complies, or the permit is modified to comply, with the Seattle Building, Residential, Stormwater, Side Sewer and Grading codes in effect on the date of application for renewal; or
            2. The work authorized by the permit is substantially underway and progressing at a rate approved by the Director. "Substantially underway" means that normally required inspections have been approved for work such as excavation that is being completed on a continuing basis;
        4. When an application for renewal is submitted on or after January 1, 2016, the permit shall not be renewed unless: (a) the Director determines that the permit complies, or is modified to comply, with the Seattle Stormwater Code in effect on the date of application for renewal; or (b) construction has started. For purposes of this provision, "started construction" means that the site work associated with and directly related to the approved project has begun. For example, grading the project site to final grade or utility installation constitutes the start of construction; simply clearing the project site does not.
    2. Where advisable to satisfy the requirements or purposes of this code, the Director may issue grading permits that are not renewable, or are renewable only under specified special conditions.
    3. In addition to renewals under subsection 22.170.120.C.1, a permit may be renewed, or the Director may extend a permit to expire more than 18 months from the date of issuance, if commencement or completion of the work authorized by the permit is delayed by litigation, appeals, strikes or other causes related to the work authorized by the permit, beyond the permit holder's control and the applicant submits a request for extension prior to expiration of the permit.

#### 22.170.130 - Inspection

1. General. The Director may conduct or require inspection of sites to determine that work is done according to the grading permit and other applicable requirements. The Director may notify the permittee and owner if the Director determines that work is in violation of this code or the grading permit. The Director may initiate enforcement action for work that is in violation.
2. Special Inspections. The Director may require the property owner to employ a licensed civil engineer, geotechnical engineer or other person with appropriate expertise as a special inspector to conduct periodic or continuous inspection during grading, other land disturbing activity, and construction. Licensed civil and geotechnical engineers or special inspectors shall be designated in accordance with Chapter 17 of the Seattle Building Code. They shall inspect in accordance with the duties specified in Chapter 17 of the Seattle Building Code and rules adopted thereunder. The inspectors shall:

    1. Not undertake or engage in other occupations that interfere or create a conflict of interest with the inspection duties during the work on the project;
    2. Inspect the clearing, excavating, filling, compaction, grading, preloading, erosion and drainage control measures, and all other soils control aspects of the construction, and observe whether it complies with the approved plans;
    3. Inspect soils for evidence of hazardous substances or wastes;
    4. Observe whether the approved plans are sufficient to control the soil on the site and prevent off-site transport of sediment;
    5. Immediately report all evidence of hazardous substances or wastes, irregularities, insufficiencies, substitutions of material or other changes from approved plans, and violations of this code to the owner's architect, engineer or contractor, and, if the project is not brought immediately into compliance, immediately notify the Director;
    6. Immediately notify the Director when any condition threatens public health, safety or welfare, private or public property, or the environment, whether or not the threat is immediate or likely; and
    7. Notify the Director of the time schedule for off-site disposal of excavated material and, when within the City limits, of the location of and permit number of the approved disposal site.
3. Other Inspections. Subject to the approval of the Director, a person other than a licensed civil or geotechnical engineer or special inspector may conduct the required inspection if the person is under the supervision of a licensed civil engineer or geotechnical engineer and is qualified to conduct the inspection.

#### 22.170.140 - Completion of Work under Grading Permit

1. Final Inspection. Upon completion of the work, the owner shall notify the Director that the site is ready for final inspection. The Director shall not give final approval until all work, including installation of all drainage control facilities and their protective devices and all erosion control measures, has been completed in accordance with the final approved plans and required reports have been submitted.
2. Final Plans. When grading plans have been modified during construction, the Director may require an as-graded plan including existing grade, location of discharge points, elevations, and location and maintenance requirements of all surface and subsurface drainage control facilities as called out by a drainage control plan.

#### 22.170.150 - Modifications During Construction

The Director may require that grading operations, other land disturbing activity, and project designs be modified during operations if physical conditions are discovered on the site that are inconsistent with the assumptions upon which the permit was based, including, but not limited to, unexpected soil or water conditions, and weather-generated problems, or if undue delays make modifications necessary. The Director may require tests, reports and geotechnical investigations to be performed and prepared by a licensed civil engineer or geotechnical engineer. Requirements may include field density tests, summaries of field and laboratory tests and other substantiating data and comments on any changes made during grading but not shown on the approved plans and their effect on the recommendations of the engineer of record.

If the permit holder makes changes after the permit has been issued, the Director may require that the changes be evaluated by the engineer of record.


#### 22.170.155 - Review By Construction Codes Advisory Board.

1. Request for review. Upon request by the applicant, the Construction Codes Advisory Board as described in the Seattle Building Code (CCAB) may review decisions or actions pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this code other than stop work orders, emergency orders, notices of violations, cancellations of grading applications, and revocations of permits. Requests for CCAB review shall be submitted in writing to the Director prior to final inspection. Requests for CCAB review are not appeals.
2. Conduct of review. The review shall be conducted by a panel of three or more members of the Construction Codes Advisory Board, chosen by the Chair. The Chair shall consider the issue under review when selecting members to conduct the review. The role of the review panel is advisory only. The Director shall make any decision required. A request for review and any review process or recommendation shall not affect or defer any obligation of an applicant to comply with provisions of this code or any permit.

#### 22.170.160 - Unsafe Premises

1. Definition. For the purpose of this Section 22.170.160 unsafe premises include all premises, whether improved or unimproved, and all structures whenever erected or altered, that are structurally unsound or unsafe, or that are otherwise dangerous to human life or constitute a hazard to safety, health, the environment or public welfare, because of any activity regulated by this code or any erosion, flooding, landslides, soil liquefaction, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence, or earth movement.
2. Emergency Orders. Whenever the Director finds that any premises or portion thereof are in such a dangerous and unsafe condition as to constitute an imminent hazard to life or limb, the Director may issue an emergency order directing that the premises, or portion thereof, be restored to a safe condition. The order shall specify the time for compliance. The Director may order that the premises, or portion thereof, be vacated within a reasonable time, to be specified in the order. In the case of extreme danger, the order may specify immediate vacation of the premises, or may authorize disconnection of the utilities or energy source, or both. No person may occupy the premises, or portion thereof after the date on which the premises are required to be vacated until they are restored to a safe condition as required by the order and this code.
3. Hazard Correction Order. Whenever the Director finds that unsafe premises exist the Director may issue a hazard correction order specifying the conditions causing the premises to be unsafe and directing the owner or any other person responsible for the unsafe premises, or both, to correct the condition by a date certain. In lieu of correction, the owner or other person responsible may submit, not later than the date specified in the order, a report or analysis to the Director analyzing the conditions and establishing that the premises are not unsafe premises. The Director may require that the report or analysis be prepared by a licensed civil engineer. If the Director accepts the conclusions of the report or analysis, the Director shall withdraw the hazard correction order. If the Director determines that the report or analysis is not sufficient to establish that the premises are not unsafe premises, the Director shall notify the owner, and the hazard correction order shall remain in effect. The Director may issue a revised hazard correction order with a new date for correction of the condition and any other changes to the terms of the original order that the Director deems appropriate, in which case the owner or other responsible person shall not have the alternative to submit a further report or analysis unless expressly allowed by the new order.

#### 22.170.170 - Violations and Penalties

1. Violations. It is a violation of this code to:

    1. Violate or fail to comply with any requirement of this code;
    2. Violate or fail to comply with a final order, a stop work order, an emergency order or a hazard correction order issued pursuant to the provisions of this code;
    3. Act in a manner prohibited by this code or a permit, approval, rule, or order issued pursuant to this code;
    4. Aid, abet, counsel, encourage, incite, induce, hire or otherwise procure another person to violate this code;
    5. Remove, mutilate, destroy or conceal any notice or order issued or posted by the Director pursuant to the provisions of this code, or any notice or order issued or posted by the Director in response to a natural disaster or other emergency; or
    6. Make or submit any false or misleading statement or information as part of or in connection with any application for any grading permit or any approval under this code.
2. Notice of Violation.

    1. Issuance of Notice. If after investigation the Director determines that any standard or requirement of this code has been violated or that any order or requirement has not been complied with, the Director may serve a notice of violation upon the owner and on any other persons responsible for the action or condition. The notice of violation shall state the standards, orders or requirements violated, shall state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply with the standards, order or requirements, and shall set a time for compliance.
    2. Service of Notice. The notice shall be served by personal service or regular first class mail addressed to the last known address of the person to whom it is directed. If no address is available after reasonable inquiry, the notice may be posted in a conspicuous place on the property. The notice may also be posted even if served by personal service or first class mail. The notice of violation shall be considered a final order of the Director if no request for review by the Director is made within the period allowed by subsection 22.170.170.B.3. Nothing in this Section 22.170.170 limits or precludes any action or proceeding pursuant to Section 22.170.160, and nothing in this Section 22.170.170 shall obligate or require the Director to issue a notice of violation prior to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
    3. Review by the Director for Notice of Violation

        1. Any person affected by a notice of violation issued pursuant to this code may obtain a review of the notice by making a request in writing by the earlier of ten days after service of the notice, or the date compliance is required. When the last day of the period computed is a Saturday, Sunday, federal or City holiday, the period runs until 5:00 p.m. of the next business day.
        2. The review shall occur not less than ten nor more than 20 days after the request is received by the Director unless otherwise agreed by the person requesting the review.
        3. Any person aggrieved by or interested in the notice of violation may submit additional information to the Director.
        4. The review shall be made by a representative of the Director who will review the basis for issuance of the notice of violation and any additional information that is submitted. The reviewer may request clarification of the information received and a site visit.
        5. After the review, the Director shall:

            1. Sustain the notice; or
            2. Withdraw the notice; or
            3. Continue the review to a date certain; or
            4. Amend the notice.
        6. The Director shall issue an order containing the decision within 15 days of the date that the review is completed and shall cause the order to be mailed by regular first class mail to the persons requesting the review and the persons named on the notice of violation, addressed to their last known addresses.
3. Judicial Review. Because civil actions to enforce this Chapter are brought in Seattle Municipal Court pursuant to subsection 22.170.170.D, orders of the Director issued under this code are not subject to judicial review pursuant to Chapter 36.70C RCW.
4. Civil Penalties.

    1. Amount of Penalties. Any person violating or failing to comply with the provisions of this code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the Director has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation.
    2. Municipal Court. Civil actions to enforce this code shall be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court, except as otherwise required by law or court rule. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed. The issuance of a notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists or existed.
5. Alternative Criminal Penalty. Any person who violates or fails to comply with this code shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $5000 or by imprisonment for not more than 365 days or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day's violation or failure to comply shall constitute a separate offense.
6. Additional Relief. The Director may request that the City Attorney seek legal or equitable relief, including without limitation orders to enjoin any acts or practices or to abate or remedy any condition, when the Director deems it necessary to achieve compliance or to protect the public or the environment.
7. Notices. The Director may record a copy of any order or notice with the King County Recorder's Office, at the expense of the owner, so as to become part of the King County real property records. The Director may record with the King County Recorder's Office a notification that a grading permit has expired without a final inspection after reasonable efforts have been made to provide a final inspection.
8. Stop Work Orders.

    1. Issuance of Stop Work Order. The Director may issue a stop work order whenever any work is being done contrary to the provisions of this code or contrary to the terms of any grading permit, or in the event of dangerous or unsafe conditions related to grading or any other activity regulated by this code or any grading permit, or if required insurance is not maintained or is cancelled. The stop work order shall identify the violation and may prohibit work or other activity on the site, and may require that the site be secured or put into a safe condition.
    2. Service of Stop Work Order. The Director may serve the stop work order by posting it in a conspicuous place at the site, if posting is physically practicable. If posting is not physically practicable, then the stop work order may be served in the manner set forth in RCW 4.28.080 for service of a summons or by sending it by first class mail to the last known address of the property owner, the person doing or causing the work to be done, and the holder of a permit if work is being stopped on a permit. For purposes of this Section 22.170.170, service is complete at the time of posting or of personal service, or if mailed, three days after the date of mailing. When the last day of the period so computed is not a business day, the period runs until 5:00 p.m. on the next business day.

        1. Proof of ownership of the adjoining property by the applicant; or
        2. An easement, granted by the fee owner of the encroached-upon property, which authorizes the encroachment on the adjoining property; or
        3. A letter or agreement signed by the fee owner of the adjoining property, which authorizes such temporary encroachments during construction on the adjoining property as temporary change of grade, temporary stockpiling or shoring tiebacks.
    2. When an application for grading permit includes an easement authorizing permanent encroachment on adjoining property, the easement instrument shall be provided to the Director by the applicant prior to issuance of any grading permit. The instrument shall specify the purpose for granting the encroachment. The instrument shall be recorded with the King County Recorder's Office.
    3. Any instrument, letter or agreement authorizing temporary encroachment shall state that it will terminate only after the grading work is completed in accordance with Section 22.170.140.
4. Setbacks. The tops and toes of graded slopes shall be set back from property boundaries and structures as far as is necessary for safety and foundation support and to prevent damage resulting from drainage or other water runoff, erosion or excessive loading.

#### 22.170.210 - Grading in Areas of Special Flood Hazard

Exceptions:


1. Where fill is placed, compacted and sloped to minimize shifting, slumping and erosion during the rise and fall of flood water and, as applicable, wave action;
2. In floodways, where it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a registered design professional in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed grading or fill, or both, will not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the design flood as defined in the Seattle Building Code;
3. In flood hazard areas subject to high-velocity wave action as defined in the Seattle Building Code, where filling is conducted and/or fill is placed to avoid diversion of water and waves toward any building or structure;
4. Where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has specified design flood elevations but has not designated floodways and the applicant demonstrates that the cumulative effect of the proposed flood hazard area encroachment, when combined with all other existing and anticipated flood hazard area encroachment, will not increase the design flood elevation more than 1 foot at any point.

1. In addition to requirements for grading permit set forth in this code, all grading in areas of special flood hazard, as identified in the report entitled "Flood Insurance Study for King County, Washington and Incorporated Areas" and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps that are filed with the City Clerk in C.F. 296948, is subject to additional standards and requirements, including floodplain development approval or a Floodplain Development License, as set forth in SMC Chapter 25.06, the Seattle Floodplain Development Ordinance. Grading in a flood-prone area as defined in SMC 25.09.020 is subject to the requirements of SMC Chapter 25.09, Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas.
2. Grading and fill shall not be done or permitted in areas of special flood hazard.

#### 22.170.220 - Erosion Control

1. Methods. Grading and other land disturbing activity shall comply with the applicable requirements set forth in SMC Title 22, Subtitle VIII, the Stormwater Code and rules promulgated thereunder. Devices or procedures for erosion control shall be initiated or installed prior to commencing grading operations when technically feasible, and in any case as soon thereafter as is technically feasible, and shall be maintained or altered to prevent erosion and sediment transport from the site according to the means and methods of construction activity.
2. Exposure. Grading and other land disturbing activity shall be conducted so as to expose the smallest practical area of soil to erosion for the least possible time. Grading and other land disturbing activity shall comply with the applicable requirements for exposed soils, including best management practices, promulgated pursuant to SMC Title 22, Subtitle VIII, the Stormwater Code.
3. Project Completion. Before the completion of the project, all exposed soils that have been disturbed shall be permanently stabilized. Methods such as permanent seeding, planting, and sodding may be specified by rules promulgated by the Director.

#### 22.170.230 - Boundary Location

The Director may require sufficient staking of property lines, top and toe of the fill and all areas where equipment traffic is to be excluded. Stakes shall be at least 2-inch by 2-inch posts or one and ½-inch pipes that are readily visible and durable. Stakes shall be maintained and visible during grading operations to enable the Director to determine property lines, the top and toe of the fill and excluded areas. The Director may require a survey prepared by a land surveyor licensed by the State of Washington.


#### 22.170.240 - Fencing

The Director may, during grading operations at a permitted grading site, require fencing and a lockable gate of suitable materials to control access to the grading site until all grading activity is complete, or until a Certificate of Occupancy is issued, whichever occurs last. Failure of the Director to require a fence does not relieve the owner of liability arising out of access to and use of the site.


#### 22.170.250 - Severability

The provisions of this subtitle are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or portion of this subtitle, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this subtitle or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

#### 22.200.020 - Declaration of findings and intent.

1. It is found and declared that there exist, within The City of Seattle, buildings together with appurtenant structures and premises that are substandard, deteriorating, in danger of causing or contributing to the creation of slums or otherwise blighted areas, and hazardous to the health safety and general welfare of the public.
2. It is further found and declared that these conditions are the result of, among other causes: inadequate original construction; dilapidation; failure to repair; lack of proper sanitary facilities and maintenance; structural defects; vacant or abandoned buildings or properties; overcrowding; electrical, mechanical and other defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or other calamities; uncleanliness; inadequate heating, lighting and ventilation.
3. It is further found that maintenance of the housing stock is critical to the health, safety and welfare of the general public and it is the intent of this Code to assure the preservation of the existing supply of housing in The City of Seattle by establishing minimum standards and an effective means for enforcement and by encouraging the rehabilitation and re-use of existing structurally sound buildings.
4. It is further found and declared that arbitrary eviction of responsible tenants imposes upon such tenants the hardship of locating replacement housing and provides no corresponding benefit to property owners.
5. It is further found and declared that tenants who do not respect the rights of others impose unnecessary hardship.
6. It is the intent of this Code that relocation assistance payments required by Subtitle II of Title 22 shall be in addition to a refund from the property owner of any deposits and of other sums to which a tenant is lawfully entitled under state or federal law.
7. The express purpose of this Code is to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not to protect individuals or create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the terms of this Code.

#### Subchapter VI - Duties of Owners and Tenants
##### 22.206.150 - General.

Notwithstanding the provisions of any rental agreements or contracts to the contrary, there are hereby imposed on owners and tenants certain duties with respect to the use, occupancy, and maintenance of buildings.


##### 22.206.160 - Duties of owners

1. It shall be the duty of all owners, regardless of any lease provision or other agreement that purports to transfer the owner's responsibilities hereunder to an operator, manager, or tenant, to:

    1. Remove all garbage, rubbish, and other debris from the premises;
    2. Secure any building which became vacant against unauthorized entry as required by Section 22.206.200;
    3. Exterminate insects, rodents and other pests which are a menace to public health, safety or welfare. Compliance with the Director's Rule governing the extermination of pests shall be deemed compliance with this subsection 22.206.160.A.3;
    4. Remove from the building or the premises any article, substance or material imminently hazardous to the health, safety, or general welfare of the occupants or the public, or which may substantially contribute to or cause deterioration of the building to such an extent that it may become a threat to the health, safety, or general welfare of the occupants or the public;
    5. Remove vegetation and debris as required by Section 10.52.030;
    6. Lock or remove all doors and/or lids on furniture used for storage, appliances, and furnaces which are located outside an enclosed, locked building or structure;
    7. Maintain the building and equipment in compliance with the minimum standards specified in Sections 22.206.010 through 22.206.140 and in a safe condition, except for maintenance duties specifically imposed in this Section 22.206.170 on the tenant of the building; provided that this subsection 22.206.160.A.7 shall not apply to owner-occupied dwelling units in which no rooms are rented to others;
    8. Affix and maintain the street number to the building in a conspicuous place over or near the principal street entrance or entrances or in some other conspicuous place. This provision shall not be construed to require numbers on either appurtenant buildings or other buildings or structures where the Director finds that the numbering is not appropriate. Numbers shall be easily legible, in contrast with the surface upon which they are placed. Figures shall be no less than 2 inches high;
    9. Maintain the building in compliance with the requirements of Section 3403.1 of the Seattle Building Code;
    10. Comply with any emergency order issued by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections; and
    11. Furnish tenants with keys for the required locks on their respective housing units and building entrance doors.
2. It shall be the duty of all owners of buildings that contain rented housing units, regardless of any lease provision or other agreement that purports to transfer the owner's responsibilities hereunder to an operator, manager or tenant, to:

    1. Maintain in a clean and sanitary condition the shared areas, including yards and courts, of any building containing two or more housing units;
    2. Supply enough garbage cans or other approved containers of sufficient size to contain all garbage disposed of by such tenants;
    3. Maintain heat in all occupied habitable rooms, baths and toilet rooms at an inside temperature, as measured at a point 3 feet above the floor and 2 feet from exterior walls, of at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. and 58 degrees Fahrenheit between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 7 a.m. from September 1 until June 30, when the owner is contractually obligated to provide heat;
    4. Install smoke detectors on the ceiling or on the wall not less than 4 inches nor more than 12 inches from the ceiling at a point or points centrally located in a corridor or area in each housing unit and test smoke detectors when each housing unit becomes vacant;
    5. Make all needed repairs or replace smoke detectors with operating detectors before a unit is reoccupied; and
    6. Instruct tenants as to the purpose, operation and maintenance of the detectors.
3. Just cause eviction

    1. Pursuant to provisions of the state Residential Landlord-Tenant Act (RCW 59.18.290), owners may not evict residential tenants without a court order, which can be issued by a court only after the tenant has an opportunity in a show cause hearing to contest the eviction (RCW 59.18.380). Owners of housing units shall not evict or attempt to evict any tenant, or otherwise terminate or attempt to terminate the tenancy of any tenant unless the owner can prove in court that just cause exists. Owners may not evict residential tenants from rental housing units if the units are not registered with the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections as required by Section 22.214.040, regardless of whether just cause for eviction may exist. An owner is in compliance with this registration requirement if the rental housing unit is registered with the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections before entry of a court order authorizing eviction or before a writ of restitution is granted. A court may grant a continuance in an eviction action in order to give the owner time to register the rental housing unit. The reasons for termination of tenancy listed below, and no others, shall constitute just cause under this Section 22.206.160:

        1. The tenant fails to comply with a three day notice to pay rent or vacate pursuant to RCW 59.12.030(3); a ten day notice to comply or vacate pursuant to RCW 59.12.030(4); or a three day notice to vacate for waste, nuisance (including a drug-related activity nuisance pursuant to chapter RCW 7.43), or maintenance of an unlawful business or conduct pursuant to RCW 59.12.030(5);
        2. The tenant habitually fails to pay rent when due which causes the owner to notify the tenant in writing of late rent four or more times in a 12 month period;
        3. The tenant fails to comply with a ten day notice to comply or vacate that requires compliance with a material term of the rental agreement or that requires compliance with a material obligation under chapter 59.18 RCW;
        4. The tenant habitually fails to comply with the material terms of the rental agreement which causes the owner to serve a ten day notice to comply or vacate three or more times in a 12 month period;
        5. The owner seeks possession so that the owner or a member of his or her immediate family may occupy the unit as that person's principal residence and no substantially equivalent unit is vacant and available in the same building, and the owner has given the tenant at least 90 days' advance written notice of the date the tenant's possession is to end. The Director may reduce the time required to give notice to no less than 20 days if the Director determines that delaying occupancy will result in a personal hardship to the owner or to the owner's immediate family. Personal hardship may include but is not limited to hardship caused by illness or accident, unemployment, or job relocation. For the purposes of this Section 22.206.160, "Immediate family" includes the owner's domestic partner registered pursuant to Section 1 of Ordinance 117244 or the owner's spouse, parents, grandparents, children, brothers and sisters of the owner, of the owner's spouse, or of the owner's domestic partner. There is a rebuttable presumption of a violation of this subsection 22.206.160.C.1.e if the owner or a member of the owner's immediate family fails to occupy the unit as that person's principal residence for at least 60 consecutive days during the 90 days immediately after the tenant vacated the unit pursuant to a notice of termination or eviction using this subparagraph as the cause for eviction;
        6. The owner elects to sell a single-family dwelling unit and gives the tenant at least 90 days' written notice prior to the date set for vacating, which date shall coincide with the end of the term of a rental agreement, or if the agreement is month to month, with the last day of a monthly period. The Director may reduce the time required to give notice to no less than 60 days if the Director determines that providing 90 days' notice will result in a personal hardship to the owner. Personal hardship may include but is not limited to hardship caused by illness or accident, unemployment, or job relocation. For the purposes of this Section 22.206.160, an owner "elects to sell" when the owner makes reasonable attempts to sell the dwelling within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, including, at a minimum, listing it for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertising it for sale at a reasonable price in a newspaper of general circulation. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner did not intend to sell the unit if:

            1. Within 30 days after the tenant has vacated, the owner does not list the single-family dwelling unit for sale at a reasonable price with a realty agency or advertise it for sale at a reasonable price in a newspaper of general circulation, or
            2. Within 90 days after the date the tenant vacated or the date the property was listed for sale, whichever is later, the owner withdraws the rental unit from the market, rents the unit to someone other than the former tenant, or otherwise indicates that the owner does not intend to sell the unit;
        7. The tenant's occupancy is conditioned upon employment on the property and the employment relationship is terminated;
        8. The owner seeks to do substantial rehabilitation in the building; provided that, the owner must obtain a tenant relocation license if required by Chapter 22.210 and at least one permit necessary for the rehabilitation, other than a Master Use Permit, before terminating the tenancy;
        9. The owner (i) elects to demolish the building, convert it to a cooperative, or convert it to a nonresidential use; provided that, the owner must obtain a tenant relocation license if required by Chapter 22.210 and a permit necessary to demolish or change the use before terminating any tenancy, or (ii) converts the building to a condominium provided the owner complies with the provisions of Sections 22.903.030 and 22.903.035;
        10. The owner seeks to discontinue use of a housing unit unauthorized by Title 23 after receipt of a notice of violation. The owner is required to pay relocation assistance to the tenant(s) of each such unit at least two weeks prior to the date set for termination of the tenancy, at the rate of:

            1. $2,000 for a tenant household with an income during the past 12 months at or below 50 percent of the County median income, or
            2. Two months' rent for a tenant household with an income during the past 12 months above 50 percent of the County median income;
        11. The owner seeks to reduce the number of individuals residing in a dwelling unit to comply with the maximum limit of individuals allowed to occupy one dwelling unit, as required by Title 23, and:

            1. The number of such individuals was more than is lawful under the current version of Title 23 but was lawful under Title 23 or Title 24 on August 10, 1994;

                1. That number has not increased with the knowledge or consent of the owner at any time after August 10, 1994; and
                2. The owner is either unwilling or unable to obtain a permit to allow the unit with that number of residents.
            2. The owner has served the tenants with a 30 day notice, informing the tenants that the number of tenants exceeds the legal limit and must be reduced to the legal limit,
            3. After expiration of the 30 day notice, the owner has served the tenants with and the tenants have failed to comply with a ten day notice to comply with the limit on the number of occupants or vacate, and
            4. If there is more than one rental agreement for the unit, the owner may choose which agreements to terminate; provided that, the owner may either terminate no more than the minimum number of rental agreements necessary to comply with the legal limit on the number of occupants, or, at the owner's option, terminate only those agreements involving the minimum number of occupants necessary to comply with the legal limit;
        12. The owner seeks to reduce the number of individuals who reside in one dwelling unit to comply with the legal limit after receipt of a notice of violation of the Title 23 restriction on the number of individuals allowed to reside in a dwelling unit, and:

            1. The owner has served the tenants with a 30 day notice, informing the tenants that the number of tenants exceeds the legal limit and must be reduced to the legal limit; provided that, no 30 day notice is required if the number of tenants was increased above the legal limit without the knowledge or consent of the owner;
            2. After expiration of the 30 day notice required by subsection 22.206.160.1.1.a above, or at any time after receipt of the notice of violation if no 30 day notice is required pursuant to subsection 22.206.160.1.1.a, the owner has served the tenants with and the tenants have failed to comply with a ten day notice to comply with the maximum legal limit on the number of occupants or vacate; and
            3. If there is more than one rental agreement for the unit, the owner may choose which agreements to terminate; provided that, the owner may either terminate no more than the minimum number of rental agreements necessary to comply with the legal limit on the number of occupants, or, at the option of the owner, terminate only those agreements involving the minimum number of occupants necessary to comply with the legal limit.
            4. For any violation of the maximum legal limit on the number of individuals allowed to reside in a unit that occurred with the knowledge or consent of the owner, the owner is required to pay relocation assistance to the tenant(s) of each such unit at least two weeks prior to the date set for termination of the tenancy, at the rate of:

                1. $2,000 for a tenant household with an income during the past 12 months at or below 50 percent of the county median income, or
                2. Two months' rent for a tenant household with an income during the past 12 months above 50 percent of the county median income;
        13. The owner seeks to discontinue use of an accessory dwelling unit for which a permit has been obtained pursuant to Sections 23.44.041 and 23.45.545 after receipt of a notice of violation of the development standards provided in those sections. The owner is required to pay relocation assistance to the tenant household residing in such a unit at least two weeks prior to the date set for termination of the tenancy, at the rate of:

            1. $2,000 for a tenant household with an income during the past 12 months at or below 50 percent of the county median income, or
            2. Two months' rent for a tenant household with an income during the past 12 months above 50 percent of the county median income;

        15. The owner seeks to discontinue sharing with a tenant of the owner's own housing unit, i.e., the unit in which the owner resides, seeks to terminate the tenancy of a tenant of an accessory dwelling unit authorized pursuant to Sections 23.44.041 and 23.45.545 that is accessory to the housing unit in which the owner resides, or seeks to terminate the tenancy of a tenant in a single-family dwelling unit and the owner resides in an accessory dwelling unit on the same lot. This subsection 22.206.160.C.1.o does not apply if the owner has received a notice of violation of the development standards of Section 23.44.041. If the owner has received such a notice of violation, subsection 22.206.160.C.1.m applies;
        16. A tenant, or with the consent of the tenant, the tenant's subtenant, sublessee, resident, or guest, has engaged in criminal activity on the premises, or on the property or public right-of-way abutting the premises, and the owner has specified in the notice of termination the crime alleged to have been committed and the general facts supporting the allegation, and has assured that the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections has recorded receipt of a copy of the notice of termination. For purposes of this subsection 22.206.160.C.1.p, a person has "engaged in criminal activity" if he or she:

            1. Engages in drug-related activity that would constitute a violation of chapters 69.41, 69.50, or 69.52 RCW, or
            2. Engages in activity that is a crime under the laws of this state, but only if the activity substantially affects the health or safety of other tenants or the owner.
    2. Any rental agreement provision which waives or purports to waive any right, benefit or entitlement created by this subsection 22.206.160.C.1.p shall be deemed void and of no lawful force or effect.
    3. With any termination notices required by law, owners terminating any tenancy protected by this Section 22.206.160 shall advise the affected tenant or tenants in writing of the reasons for the termination and the facts in support of those reasons.
    4. If a tenant who has received a notice of termination of tenancy claiming subsection 22.206.160.C.1.e, 22.206.160.C.1.f, or 22.206.160.C.1.m as the ground for termination believes that the owner does not intend to carry out the stated reason for eviction and makes a complaint to the Director, then the owner must, within ten days of being notified by the Director of the complaint, complete and file with the Director a certification stating the owner's intent to carry out the stated reason for the eviction. The failure of the owner to complete and file such a certification after a complaint by the tenant shall be a defense for the tenant in an eviction action based on this ground.
    5. In any action commenced to evict or to otherwise terminate the tenancy of any tenant, it shall be a defense to the action that there was no just cause for such eviction or termination as provided in this Section 22.206.160.

    7. An owner who evicts or attempts to evict a tenant or who terminates or attempts to terminate the tenancy of a tenant using a notice which references subsections 22.206.160.C.1.e, 22.206.160.C.1.f or 22.206.160.C.1.h as the ground for eviction or termination of tenancy without fulfilling or carrying out the stated reason for or condition justifying the termination of such tenancy shall be liable to such tenant in a private right for action for damages up to $2,000, costs of suit, or arbitration and reasonable attorney's fees.

##### 22.206.170 - Duties of tenants.

It shall be the duty of every tenant to:

If a community or recreation room is not available, meetings may take place in common areas which include a laundry room, hallway or lobby; provided all generally applicable rules of the landlord governing such common areas and applicable fire and safety codes are followed.
2. The following rebuttable presumptions shall apply in any proceeding to collect a civil penalty for violation of subsection 22.206.180.A.5.

    1. Any owner who takes any action listed in subsection 22.206.180.A.5 within 90 days after a tenant has in good faith reported violations of this Code (Chapter 22.206) to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections or to the Seattle Police Department, or otherwise asserted, exercised or attempted to exercise any legal rights granted tenants by law and arising out of a tenant's occupancy of the building, or within 90 days after any inspection or proceeding by a governmental agency resulting from such legal right asserted, exercised or attempted to be exercised by a tenant, creates a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that the action was taken for the reason that the tenant had in good faith reported violations of this Code to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections or to the Seattle Police Department or otherwise asserted, exercised or attempted to exercise any legal rights granted the tenant by law; except that, if at the time an owner gives a notice of termination of tenancy pursuant to chapter 59.12 RCW, the tenant is in arrears in rent or in breach of any other lease or rental obligation, there is a rebuttable presumption that the landlord's action is neither a reprisal nor retaliatory action against the tenant.
    2. A tenant who makes a complaint or report to a governmental authority about an owner or owner's property within 90 days after notice of a proposed increase in rent or other action in good faith by the owner creates a rebuttable presumption that the complaint or report was not made in good faith, unless the complaint or report was that the proposed increase in rent or other action was unlawful, in which case no such presumption applies.
    3. The rebuttable presumption under subsection 22.206.180.B.1 shall not apply with respect to an increase in rent if the owner, in a notice to the tenant of an increase in rent, specifies reasonable grounds for said increase and the notice of said increase does not violate subsection 7.24.030.A.

##### 22.206.190 - Harassing or retaliating against owner.

2. Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of this Code, the Director may grant modifications for individual cases, provided he or she first finds that a special individual reason makes compliance with the strict letter of this Code impractical and that the modification is in conformity with the intent and purpose of this Code and that such modification does not lessen any fire protection or safety requirements or any degree of structural integrity. The details of any action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the files of the Director.

##### 22.206.217 - Variances

1. The Director may grant a variance from the standards and requirements of SMC Sections 22.206.010 through 22.206.140 and Section 22.206.200 if the Director determines that all of the following conditions or circumstances exist:

If a new notice of violation is not issued and served upon a new owner, the Director shall grant the new owner the same number of days to comply with the notice of violation as was given the previous owner in the notice of violation. The compliance period shall be the number of days between the date of issuance of the notice of violation and the date for compliance stated in the text of the notice. The compliance period for the new owner shall begin on the date that the conveyance is completed.
4. The notice shall be served upon the owner, tenant or other person responsible for the condition by personal service, or by first class mail to the person's last known address. If the address of the responsible person is unknown and cannot be found after a reasonable search, the notice may be served by posting a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the property. If a notice of violation is directed to a tenant or other person responsible for the violation who is not the owner, a copy of the notice shall be sent to the owner of the property. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit or preclude any action or proceeding to enforce this chapter nor does anything in this section obligate the director to issue a notice of violation prior to initiation of a civil or criminal enforcement action except as otherwise provided in Director's rules adopted pursuant to SMC chapter 22.202.
5. In addition, a copy of the notice or order may be posted at a conspicuous place on the property.

    1. The type and degree of violations found;
    2. Applicable time limits for correction of similar violations provided in the State Landlord-Tenant Act, RCW Chapter 59.18;
    3. The responsible party's demonstrated intent to repair, demolish, or vacate and close the building. Evidence of the responsible party's intent may include, but is not limited to:

    4. The procedural requirements for obtaining a permit to correct the violations;

3. The Director or a representative of the Director who is familiar with the case and the applicable ordinances will review any additional information that is submitted and the basis for issuance of the notice of violation. The reviewer may request clarification of information received and a site visit. After the review, the Director shall:

    1. Sustain the notice of violation; or
    2. Withdraw the notice of violation; or
    3. Continue the review to a date certain for receipt of additional information; or
    4. Amend the notice of violation.

2. Unless a request for review before the Director is made pursuant to Section 22.206.230, the notice of violation shall become the order the Director.
3. Because civil actions to enforce Chapter 22.206 are brought in Seattle Municipal Court pursuant to Section 22.206.280, orders of the Director issued under this chapter are not subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 36.70C RCW.

##### 22.206.240 - Extension of compliance date.

1. The Director may extend the compliance date if required repairs have been commenced and, in the Director's opinion, are progressing at a satisfactory rate. Extensions in excess of ninety (90) days may not be granted unless the need therefor is established in a Director's review.
2. Vacating and Closing of Historic Buildings or Structures. The compliance date for historic buildings and structures that are closed to entry pursuant to Section 22.206.200 of this Code, during the notice of violation compliance period, shall be extended for as long as the building or structure is maintained in compliance with the standards of Section 22.206.200 of this Code.

##### 22.206.250 - Compliance.

2. Until a property owner or other person named in a notice, order or decision demonstrates, and the Director confirms by inspection, that the obligations imposed by the standards established in this Code have been fulfilled, there shall be a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof at trial that the violations listed in such notice, order or decision have not been corrected, provided, that there shall be no rebuttable presumption in any criminal prosecution under SMC Section 22.206.290.

3. On issuance of a certificate of compliance, the Director warrants only that the violations listed in the notice, order or decision have been corrected as required by this Code. The Director makes no representation concerning other conditions in buildings, or of any equipment therein that is not listed in the notice of violation.

In the alternative, the order may require that the building, housing unit or premises be immediately vacated and closed to entry.
2. The emergency order shall be posted on the building, housing unit or premises, and shall be mailed by regular, first class mail to the last known address of the property owners and, if applicable, to the occupants.

5. Any building, housing unit or premises subject to an emergency order that is not repaired within the time specified in the order is found and declared to be a public nuisance that the Director is hereby authorized to abate summarily by such means and with such assistance as may be available to the Director, and the costs thereof shall be recovered by the Director in the manner provided by law.

1. Except for violations of Section 22.206.180, any person violating or failing to comply with any requirement of this Code shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed:

    1. One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) per day for each housing unit in violation, and One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) per day for violations in the common area or on the premises surrounding the building or structure, from the date the violation begins, for the first ten (10) days of noncompliance; and Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per day for each housing unit in violation, and Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per day for violations in the common area or on the premises surrounding the building or structure, for each day beyond ten (10) days of noncompliance until compliance is achieved. In cases where the Director has issued a notice of violation, the violation will be deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation. In addition to the per diem penalty, a violation compliance inspection charge equal to the base fee set by Section 22.900B.010 shall be charged for the third inspection and all subsequent inspections until compliance is achieved. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 22.202.050, the compliance inspection charges shall be deposited in the General Fund; or
2. One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per day from the date a tenant fails to reimburse The City of Seattle for emergency relocation assistance as required by subsection D of Section 22.206.265 until the date the relocation assistance is repaid to The City of Seattle.
3. One Hundred Dollars ($ 100.00) per day for any person who provides false or misleading information to the Director and as a result of the false or misleading information is paid emergency relocation assistance by The City of Seattle for which the person would not otherwise be eligible, from the date the person receives the emergency relocation assistance until the date the relocation assistance is repaid to The City of Seattle.

1. Any person who does not comply with an emergency order issued by the Director pursuant to this Chapter 22.206 shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty of up to One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) per day from the date set for compliance until the Director certifies that the requirements of the emergency order are fully complied with.
2. Any property owner who fails to deposit relocation assistance as required by subsections F and G of Section 22.206.260 shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty of:

    1. For each tenant with a household income during the preceding twelve (12) months at or below fifty (50) percent of the median family income for whom the property owner did not deposit relocation assistance as required by subsection G of Section 22.206.260:

        1. Three Thousand Three Hundred Dollars ($3,300.00), plus

4. Anyone who obstructs, impedes, or interferes with an attempt to inspect a building or premises pursuant to the authority of an inspection warrant issued by any court or an attempt to inspect a housing unit after consent to inspect is given by a tenant of the housing unit shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00).
5. Any person who violates or fails to comply with subsections A5, A6, or A7 of Section 22.206.180 shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty of up to Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per violation per day. Each day that a separate action or inaction occurs that is a violation of subsections A5, A6 or A7 of Section 22.206.180 constitutes a separate violation.
6. Civil actions to enforce Chapter 22.206 shall be brought exclusively in Seattle Municipal Court, except as otherwise required by law or court rule. The Director shall request in writing that the City Attorney take enforcement action. The City Attorney shall, with the assistance of the Director, take appropriate action to enforce Chapter 22.206. In any civil action filed pursuant to this chapter, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed. The issuance of a notice of violation or an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists.
7. The violator may show, in mitigation of liability, that correction of the violation was commenced promptly upon receipt of notice, but that compliance within the time specified was prevented by an inability to obtain necessary materials or labor, inability to gain access to the subject building, or other condition or circumstance beyond the control of the violator, and upon a showing of the above described conditions, the court may enter judgment for less than the maximum penalty.

##### 22.206.290 - Alternative criminal penalty.

Any person who violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this Chapter 22.206 and who has had an order of judgment entered against them for violating Titles 22 or 23 within the past seven (7) years from the date the criminal charge is filed shall upon conviction be guilty of a gross misdemeanor subject to the provisions of Chapter 12A.02 and 12A.04, except that absolute liability shall be imposed for such a violation or failure to comply, and none of the mental states described in Section 12A.04.030 need be proved. The Director may request that the City Attorney prosecute such violations criminally as an alternative to the civil procedure outlined in this chapter. Each day that anyone shall continue to violate or fail to comply with any of the foregoing provisions shall be considered a separate offense.


##### 22.206.295 - Private right of action.

In addition to any other sanction or remedial procedure that may be available, any property owner who does not deposit emergency relocation assistance with The City of Seattle for a tenant pursuant to subsections F and G of SMC Section 22.206.260 shall be subject to a private civil action by such tenant to recover the actual amount of relocation assistance payable to the tenant but not deposited with The City of Seattle by the property owner, attorney fees and court costs.


##### 22.206.305 - Tenant's private right of action.

Nothing in this Code is intended to affect or limit a tenant's right to pursue a private right of action pursuant to Chapter 59.18 RCW for any violation of Chapter 59.18 RCW for which that chapter provides a private right of action. When an owner commits an act prohibited by SMC Sections 22.206.180 A1, 22.206.180 A2, or 22.206.180 A7, a tenant has a private right of action against the owner for actual damages caused by the prohibited act. To the extent that actual damages are unliquidated or difficult to prove, a court may award liquidated damages of up to One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) instead of actual damages. Such damages when awarded are to be on a per incident, rather than a per tenant basis. The prevailing party in any such action may recover costs of the suit and attorney fees.


##### 22.206.315 - Appeal to Superior Court.

Final decisions of the Seattle Municipal Court on enforcement actions authorized by this chapter may be appealed pursuant to the Rules for Appeal of Decisions of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction.

### Chapter 22.210 - TENANT RELOCATION ASSISTANCE

Sections:

#### 22.210.010 - Short title.

The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Tenant Relocation Assistance Ordinance."


#### 22.210.020 - Findings and purpose.

1. Findings.

    1. The City of Seattle is experiencing a rapid rate of development that has reduced and continues to reduce the supply of rental housing available to low-and moderate-income tenants and has reduced the supply of rental housing affordable to such tenants.
    2. The development and real estate market in Seattle has not been able to replace low-income units lost due to demolition, change of use, substantial rehabilitation and removal of use restrictions from assisted housing, making it more difficult and more costly for low-income persons who are displaced by demolition, change of use, substantial rehabilitation or removal of use restrictions from assisted housing to locate affordable substitute rental housing.
    3. Rents in Seattle have been increasing rapidly and vacancies in rental housing are at low levels, making it increasingly difficult for tenants, especially those with low incomes, to locate affordable rental housing.
    4. Pursuant to the public hearing held on June 7, 1990, the City Council finds that costs incurred by tenants to relocate within Seattle include actual physical moving costs, advance payments, utility fees, security and damage deposits and anticipated additional rent and utility costs, which, on average, equal or exceed Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) per tenant household.
    5. The State of Washington has adopted legislation authorizing local jurisdictions to require the payment of relocation assistance to low-income tenants who are displaced from dwelling units by housing demolition, change of use, substantial rehabilitation or removal of use restrictions from assisted housing.
    6. Conditions in the current rental market have created a relocation crisis, because tenants, especially low-income tenants, do not have sufficient time to save money for relocation costs or to find comparable housing when they are evicted as a result of demolition, change of use, substantial rehabilitation or removal of use restrictions from their dwelling units.
2. Purpose. Based upon the above findings, the purpose of this chapter is to provide relocation assistance to low-income tenants displaced by demolition, substantial rehabilitation, or change of use of residential rental property, or the removal of use restrictions from assisted housing developments.

Except as provided in the preceding sentence, delivery of the packets by depositing them in the United States mail shall not be adequate delivery.
3. The owner shall obtain and submit to the Director a signed delivery receipt from an adult tenant of each affected dwelling unit showing delivery of the tenant relocation information packet.

3. If information submitted by a tenant on a relocation assistance certification form is incomplete, inadequate or appears to be inaccurate, the Director may require the tenant to submit additional information to establish eligibility for relocation assistance. If the tenant fails or refuses to respond within fifteen (15) days to the Director's request for additional information, such tenant shall not be eligible for relocation assistance.

#### 22.210.100 - Tenant eligibility for relocation assistance.

        1. The owner's application for a tenant relocation license pursuant to this chapter,
        2. The owner's application for a master use permit pursuant to SMC Chapter 23.76, et seq. which is necessary to demolish, substantially rehabilitate, change the use of or remove use restrictions from a dwelling unit, or
        3. The owner's application for a building permit which is necessary to demolish, substantially rehabilitate, change the use of or remove use restrictions from a dwelling unit; or
    2. The tenant moved into a dwelling unit after the earlier of the owner's application for a tenant relocation license, a master use permit necessary for demolition, substantial rehabilitation, change of use, or removal of use restrictions, or a building permit necessary for demolition, substantial rehabilitation, change of use, or removal of use restrictions; and, prior to taking possession of the dwelling unit, such tenant was not advised by the owner in writing:

        1. That the dwelling unit may be demolished, substantially rehabilitated, changed in use, or use restrictions removed, and
        2. That the tenant is ineligible for relocation assistance.
2. The owner shall provide the tenant with a copy of the written notice described in subsection A2 of this section prior to the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling unit, and the owner shall retain a copy with the tenant's signature acknowledging its receipt and the date of receipt. Any tenant who is not advised in writing as provided in subsection A2 of this section prior to taking occupancy shall be entitled to full relocation benefits.

Within fifteen (15) days of the Director's receipt of the signed relocation assistance certification forms from all tenants listed in the tenant relocation license application or within fifteen (15) days of the expiration of the tenants' thirty (30) day period for submitting signed relocation assistance certification forms to the Director, whichever occurs first, the Director shall send to each tenant household who submitted a signed certification form and to the owner, by both regular United States mail and certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice stating whether the tenant household's certification form indicates eligibility for relocation assistance. For those tenants who have been granted an extension pursuant to Section 22.210.090 A1, the Director shall issue a notice concerning tenant eligibility for relocation assistance to the owner and tenants within five (5) days instead of within fifteen (15) days of receiving the signed and completed relocation assistance certification forms.

#### 22.210.110 - Owner's contribution to relocation assistance.

1. The owner of a dwelling unit to be demolished, changed in use, substantially rehabilitated or from which use restrictions will be removed, is responsible for payment of one-half (½) of the total amount of relocation assistance due to eligible tenants pursuant to this chapter. The City is responsible for payment of the remaining one-half (½) of the relocation assistance.
2. Within five (5) days after receipt by the owner of the notice of tenant eligibility pursuant to subsection C of Section 22.210.100, the owner shall provide the Director with a cash deposit or a security instrument in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit with terms acceptable to the Director equal to one-half (½) of the amount of total relocation assistance to be paid to eligible tenants in the dwelling units to be demolished, changed in use, substantially rehabilitated, or from which use restrictions will be removed. The total relocation assistance shall be calculated based on the number of units occupied by tenant households who are determined by the Director to be eligible for relocation assistance, as modified by any decisions by the Hearing Examiner or a court concerning eligibility for relocation assistance at the time of payment of the owner's share of relocation assistance.

    1. An owner may, but is not required to, provide the Director with the owner's share of relocation assistance any time after application for the tenant relocation license but prior to the time it is required by subsection B1 above. If the owner chooses this option, the amount to be provided to the Director will be based on the number of units to be demolished, changed in use, substantially rehabilitated, or from which use restrictions will be removed, multiplied by the owner's share per unit for the number of units for which relocation assistance may be required. Returns of unused portions of the owner's share paid pursuant to this subsection shall be returned in accordance with subsection F of Section 22.210.130.
3. If the Director determines, at any time after the owner provides the Director with the owner's share of relocation assistance pursuant to subsection B above, that the owner has not provided sufficient funds to pay the owner's share of relocation assistance to all eligible tenants, the Director shall notify the owner of the additional amount needed, and the owner shall provide the Director with a security instrument in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposit in the requested amount within five (5) days of the Director's request.

The owner may deliver the ninety (90) day notice any time after the expiration of ten (10) days after the owner's receipt of the Director's notices of tenant eligibility for relocation assistance pursuant to Section 22.210.100, so long as the owner has already paid the owner's share of relocation assistance pursuant to SMC Section 22.210.110 B1.

If a tenant has received notice of a rent increase of ten percent or more over the periodic or monthly rental rate charged the same tenant for the same housing unit and same services for any period or month during the preceding 12 months that the tenant believes is for the purpose of avoiding the application of this Chapter 22.210, and the tenant makes a complaint to the Director within one year of receiving the notice of the rent increase, the owner shall, within ten days of being notified by the Director of the complaint, complete and file a certification with the Director stating that the rent increase is not for the purpose of avoiding the application of this Chapter 22.210. The failure of the owner to complete and timely file the certification is a defense for the tenant in an eviction action based upon the tenant's failure to pay the increased rent.
3. Regardless of whether a certification is timely filed, the Director may investigate the complaint and decide whether the rent increase was made for the purpose of avoiding the application of this Chapter 22.210. A decision by the Director that the rent increase was made for the purpose of avoiding the application of this Chapter 22.210 constitutes a finding that the owner violated subsection 22.210.136.A.
4. There is a rebuttable presumption the rent increase was made for the purpose of avoiding the application of this Chapter 22.210 and the owner violated subsection 22.210.136.A if:

    1. Within 90 days of the effective date of a rent increase of 20 percent or more over the periodic or monthly rental rate charged the same tenant for the same housing unit and same services for any period or month during the preceding 12 months, that tenant vacates a dwelling unit and, within 180 days of the effective date of the rent increase, the owner:

        1. Engages in substantial rehabilitation; or
        2. Applies for a permit for a substantial rehabilitation, demolition, change of use, or removal of use restrictions; and
    2. The owner failed to complete and timely file a certification after being notified by the Director of a complaint as provided in subsection 22.210.136.B, or failed to follow the provisions of this Chapter 22.210 after completing and timely filing the certification.
5. The Director shall mail a copy of the Director's decision to the owner and to the tenant who made the complaint.

#### 22.210.140 - Eviction protection

1. After the earlier of (1) the owner's application for a tenant relocation license; (2) the owner's application for a Master Use Permit necessary for demolition, change of use, substantial rehabilitation, or removal of use restrictions from a dwelling unit; or (3) the owner's application for a building permit necessary for demolition, change of use, substantial rehabilitation, or removal of use restrictions from a dwelling unit, the owner shall not evict any tenant except for good cause as defined in subsections 22.206.160.C.1.a, 22.206.160.C.1.b, 22.206.160.C.1.c, 22.206.160.C.1.g, 22.206.160.C.1.h, 22.206.160.C.1.i, 22.206.160.C.1.n, and 22.206.160.C.1.p, and shall not, for the purpose of avoiding or diminishing the application of this Chapter 22.210, reduce the services to any tenant or materially increase or change the obligations of any tenant.
2. Prior to application for a tenant relocation license, a master use permit necessary for demolition, change of use, substantial rehabilitation, or removal of use restrictions from a dwelling unit, or a building permit necessary for demolition, change of use, substantial rehabilitation, or removal of use restrictions from a dwelling unit, an owner shall not harass or intimidate tenants into vacating their units for the purpose of avoiding or diminishing the application of this chapter.

#### 22.210.150 - Administrative appeals

1. Either an owner or a tenant may request a hearing before the Hearing Examiner to appeal a determination concerning a tenant's eligibility for a relocation assistance payment, to resolve a dispute concerning the authority to institute unlawful detainer actions before issuance of the tenant relocation license required by Section 22.210.050, or to review a decision of the Director pursuant to subsection 22.210.136.C.
2. An appeal regarding eligibility for relocation assistance shall be filed within ten days after receipt of the Director's notice of tenant eligibility for relocation assistance.
3. A request for a hearing relating to authority to pursue unlawful detainer actions during the relocation period shall be filed prior to issuance of the tenant relocation license.
4. An appeal to review a decision of the Director pursuant to subsection 22.210.136.C shall be filed within ten days after receipt of the Director's decision.
5. When the last day of the appeal period is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day.
6. All requests for a hearing or appeal shall be in writing and shall clearly state specific objections and the relief sought. The appellant is not required to pay the Hearing Examiner filing fee set forth in Section 3.02.125.
7. Notice of the hearing shall be provided by the Hearing Examiner at least ten days prior to the scheduled hearing date to the tenant, the owner, the Director, and any other interested parties who have requested notice.
8. A record shall be established at the hearing before the Hearing Examiner. Appeals shall be considered de novo. The Director is not a necessary party to any Hearing Examiner proceedings pursuant to this Section 22.210.150.
9. On the day it is issued, the Hearing Examiner shall provide the decision on the appeal to the tenant, the property owner, the Director, and all those requesting notice.
10. The Hearing Examiner's decision is final and conclusive unless, within ten calendar days of the date of the Hearing Examiner decision, an application or petition for a writ of review is filed in King County Superior Court. Judicial review shall be confined to the record of the administrative hearing. The Superior Court may reverse the Hearing Examiner decision only if the decision is arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, in excess of the authority or jurisdiction of the Hearing Examiner, made upon unlawful procedure, or in violation of constitutional provisions.

#### 22.210.160 - Administration and enforcement.

1. The Director shall administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter and is authorized to adopt reasonable rules and regulations consistent with the chapter to carry out the Director's duties.
2. Whenever an owner fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter, the Director shall refuse to issue the tenant relocation license.
3. Any failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter or with a decision of the Hearing Examiner under this chapter shall be a violation of the Code.
4. Any failure of a tenant who has received relocation assistance pursuant to this chapter to vacate the dwelling unit on or before the expiration of the ninety (90) day notice issued pursuant to Section 22.210.120 and receipt of relocation assistance pursuant to this chapter by a person not eligible for such assistance under this chapter shall be violations of this chapter.

#### 22.210.170 - Notice of violation.

If after investigation the Director determines that a violation of this chapter has occurred or exists, the Director may have a notice of violation served upon the person responsible for the violation. The notice may be served by personal service, registered mail, or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the person responsible for the violation.

The Director shall notify the City Attorney of the name of any person subject to the penalty, and the City Attorney shall, with the assistance of the Director, take appropriate action to collect the penalty.
3. Any tenant or person aggrieved by a violation of this Chapter 22.210 may institute a private action to enforce the obligations contained in this Chapter 22.210, provided, that this subsection 22.210.180.C does not create any right of action against the City or any City officer or employee for the failure either to require any owner to pay relocation assistance or to pay tenants the amount of the owner's share with City funds.

The owner may appeal the denial or revocation by filing an appeal with the Office of the Hearing Examiner within 30 days of the revocation notice being mailed to the owner.

A decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be subject to review under Chapter 36.70C RCW.

The Department shall periodically select from registered properties containing rental housing units, the properties that shall be inspected by a qualified rental housing inspector for certification of compliance. The property selection process shall be based on a random methodology adopted by rule, and shall include at least ten percent of all registered rental properties per year. Newly-constructed or substantially-altered properties that receive final inspections or a first certificate of occupancy and register after January 1, 2014 shall be included in the random property selection process after the date the property registration is required to be renewed for the first time.
2. The Department shall ensure that all properties registered under this Chapter 22.214 shall be inspected at least once every ten years, or as otherwise allowed or required by any federal, state, or city code. In addition, at least ten percent of properties whose prior inspections are more than five years old shall be reinspected each year. The Director shall by rule determine the method of selecting properties for reinspection.
3. If the Department receives a complaint regarding a rental housing unit regulated under this program, the Department shall request that an interior inspection of the rental housing unit identified in the complaint be conducted by a Department inspector using the general authority, process, and standards of the full Housing and Building Maintenance Code, Chapters 22.200 through 22.208 of the Seattle Municipal Code. If, after inspecting the rental housing unit the Department received the complaint on, the Department determines the rental housing unit violates the standards in subsection 22.214.050.M and causes the rental housing unit to fail inspection under this Chapter 22.214, the Director may require that any other rental housing units covered under the same registration on the property be inspected following the procedures of this section 22.214.050 for inspection timing, giving notice to tenants, and submitting a certificate of compliance. The inspection of any other rental housing units may be conducted by a private qualified rental housing inspector.
4. If a property subject to this Chapter 22.214 has within two years preceding the adoption of this Chapter been subject to two or more notices of violation or one or more emergency orders of the Director for violating the standards in Chapters 22.200 through 22.208 of the Seattle Municipal Code where enforced compliance was achieved by the Department or the violation upheld in a final court decision, the rental property shall be selected for inspection during 2015 or within the first year of required inspections, consistent with the provisions of subsections 22.214.050.E through 22.214.050.M.
5. A certificate of compliance shall be issued by a qualified rental housing inspector, based upon the inspector's physical inspection of the interior and exterior of the rental housing units, and the inspection shall be conducted not more than 60 days prior to the certificate of compliance date.
6. The certificate of compliance that shall be submitted by the property owner or owner's agent within 60 days of receiving notice of a required inspection under this Section 22.214.050, shall:

    1. Certify compliance with the standards as required by this Chapter 22.214 for each rental housing unit that was inspected;

    1. In buildings that contain more than one rental housing unit, a property owner may choose to have all of the rental housing units inspected by a qualified rental housing inspector. If the building has not had Housing and Building Maintenance Code violations reported to and verified by the Department through enforced compliance or a final court decision that would have caused a unit to fail inspection under this Chapter 22.214 within any preceding 12 months or since the last inspection required by this Chapter 22.214, whichever is the most recent, an applicant may choose to have only a sample of the rental housing units inspected. If the applicant chooses to have a sample of the rental housing units inspected the following requirements shall apply:

        1. For buildings containing 20 or fewer rental housing units, a minimum of two units are required to be inspected; or

    2. The Department shall select the rental housing units to be inspected under this Section 22.214.050 using a methodology adopted by rule.
    3. If a rental housing unit selected by the Department fails the inspection, the Department may require that up to 100 percent of the rental housing units in the building where the unit that failed inspection is located be inspected.
8. Notice of inspection to tenants.

    1. After the Department selects the rental housing units to be inspected, and the Department has provided written notice to the owner or owner's agent of the units to be inspected, the owner or owner's agent shall, prior to any scheduled inspection, provide at least two days advance written notice to all tenants residing in all rental housing units on the property advising the tenants that:

        1. Some or all of the rental housing units will be inspected. If only a sample of the units will be inspected the notice shall identify the rental housing units to be inspected;

9. A certificate of compliance shall be valid and used for purposes of complying with the inspection provisions of this Chapter 22.214 for five years from the date the certificate is issued, unless the Department determines that the certificate is no longer valid because one or more of the rental units listed in the certificate of compliance no longer meets the standards as required in this Chapter 22.214. When the Department determines a certificate of compliance is no longer valid, the owner may be required to have all rental housing units on the property inspected by a qualified rental housing inspector, obtain a new certificate of compliance, and pay a new registration fee.
10. The Department shall audit certificates of compliance prepared by private qualified rental housing inspectors by reviewing certificates of compliance to determine their completeness and accuracy. If the Department determines that a violation of this Chapter 22.214 exists, the owner and qualified rental housing inspector shall be subject to all enforcement and remedial provisions provided for in this Chapter 22.214.
11. Nothing in this section precludes additional inspections conducted at the request or consent of a tenant, under the authority of a warrant, or as allowed by a tenant remedy provided for in RCW 59.18, as provided for under Title 22 of the Seattle Municipal Code, or as allowed by any other City code provision.

### Chapter 22.220 - DOWNTOWN HOUSING MAINTENANCE

Sections:

#### 22.220.010 - Title for citation.

The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be cited as the "Downtown Housing Maintenance Ordinance."


#### 22.220.020 - Findings.

The Seattle City Council hereby finds:


1. Low-income housing in downtown and adjacent lower First Hill is a scarce and diminishing resource. There has been a net loss of more than fifteen thousand (15,000) housing units in the downtown since 1960.
2. There exists an extreme shortage of low-income rental housing in the downtown area, resulting in a negligible vacancy rate for habitable low-income housing.
3. Many low-income tenants are unable to locate rental housing of any kind. These homeless persons are increasingly seeking housing in already overcrowded emergency shelters, and when such shelters are full, finding themselves on the City's streets.
4. Due to the drastic reduction in public funding, particularly federal funding, allocated to low-income housing since 1980, there are very few resources available to preserve or add new units to the existing supply of low-income housing.
5. Existing rental units in the downtown and adjacent lower First Hill constitute most of the remaining low-income rental housing in the City. The number of such units downtown is diminishing as a result of increased pressure for more intensive development downtown. Plans for major downtown development adjacent to lower First Hill have also put increased pressure on the low-income rental housing on lower First Hill.
6. Frequently, development speculation results in the premature closure of habitable existing buildings and the withdrawal of low-income rental units from the market long before such closure would be needed for any physical redevelopment of such buildings' sites.
7. There exists, especially in the downtown and adjacent First Hill a substantial number of abandoned or vacant residential units which create blight and constitute a danger to public health, safety and welfare.
8. Buildings which are vacant and not carefully secured and maintained frequently attract homeless persons seeking temporary shelter. This unsupervised use of these unheated buildings results in a fire hazard to the buildings and to the residents of nearby structures.
9. Because of the conditions described above, there exists in the city a housing emergency. This necessitates that existing low-income rental housing in the downtown and adjacent lower First Hill be both maintained and offered for rent.

#### 22.220.030 - Purpose.

This chapter, therefore, is enacted to supplement the City's existing housing and building and safety codes and:


1. To reduce blight and threats to public health, safety and welfare by requiring that low-income units be both maintained and offered for rent, where feasible;
2. To relieve the effects of the City's housing emergency by preventing the premature withdrawal of units from the rental market;
3. To maximize the use of existing scarce low-income housing resources;
4. To provide public financial and management support, where appropriate, to assist owners to maintain low-income units in safe and habitable condition and available for occupancy;
5. To respect the owner's right to use and control private property, consistent with the above purposes and constitutional protections.

#### 22.220.040 - Definitions.

1. "Director" means the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections or the Director's designee.

Household size for a SRO or studio unit shall be deemed to be one (1) person, for a one (1) bedroom unit shall be deemed to be two (2) persons, and for a two (2) bedroom unit shall be deemed to be three (3) persons.
5. "Owner" means any person who, alone or jointly, has title to or an ownership interest in any building, with or without actual possession thereof, including any person who as agent, or executor, administrator, trustee, or guardian of an estate has charge, care, or control of any building.
6. "Person" means any individual, firm, corporation, association or partnership and its agents or assigns.
7. "Rental units" means any dwelling unit, housekeeping room, or guest room as defined in the Seattle Housing Code (Chapter 22.204 of the Seattle Municipal Code) which has been occupied by tenants pursuant to rental agreements, oral or written, express or implied.

Such housing unit may also include a kitchen niche or cooking facilities and/or a private bath or may share common bathroom facilities and/or cooking facilities.

#### 22.220.050 - Applicability of chapter.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all low-income rental units if such rental units are situated in buildings located downtown or in lower First Hill and if such buildings contained any occupied rental units on or after November 5, 1984.


#### 22.220.060 - Low-income rental units—Rental responsibility.

1. Owners of habitable low-income rental units shall make a good-faith effort to rent all such units.
2. An owner's failure or refusal to make such a good-faith effort to rent shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
3. In determining whether an owner is failing or refusing to make a good-faith effort to rent habitable low-income rental units, the Director may consider any actions by the owner which are inconsistent with keeping such units rented. Evidence of a lack of good faith may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:

    1. Maintaining a building vacancy rate in excess of twenty percent (20%);
    2. Failing to offer an unoccupied unit for rent within seven (7) days of the unit becoming unoccupied, except under the circumstances provided for in Section 22.220.110;
    3. Offering units for rental at a rental rate which substantially exceeds prevailing rents for comparable rental units;
    4. Significantly reducing building services;
    5. Changing rules, regulations, terms or conditions of tenancy so as to substantially and detrimentally affect the rights and obligations of tenants or prospective tenants;
    6. Wilfully or wantonly failing to comply with applicable codes with respect to the low-income rental units or building, the violation of which substantially endangers or impairs the health or safety of the occupants;
    7. Committing or causing vandalism or the intentional destruction of a rental unit or building;
    8. Knowingly permitting a tenant to commit waste or to vandalize a rental unit.

#### 22.220.070 - Low-income rental units—Repair responsibility.

1. Owners of low-income rental units shall repair such units when such units can feasibly be made habitable. A unit can feasibly be made habitable if, after consideration of variances, deferrals and extensions of time for compliance as provided in Section 22.220.080 of this chapter, the cost of the repairs necessary to make the unit habitable does not exceed the amount which the owner may be required to contribute as provided in subsections B, C, and D of this section, together with the amount to be contributed by the City.
2. Except as provided in subsection D below, the owner's contribution to the cost of repairs necessary to make a low-income rental unit habitable shall not exceed Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) per low-income rental unit for any three (3) year period, and the total repair cost of any low-income rental unit under this subsection shall not exceed Six Thousand Dollars ($6,000.00) per low-income rental unit for any three (3) year period.
3. In determining the cost of repairing a low-income rental unit, the following rules shall apply:

    1. The costs of repair shall include only repairs necessary to meet the minimum requirements of the Housing and Building Maintenance Code, SMC Chapter 22.206, except those requirements varianced or deferred pursuant to Section 22.220.080 of this chapter.
    2. The cost of repairs to common areas or building systems shall be allocated to all the low-income rental units in the building which are required to be offered for rent, not solely to low-income rental units which are vacant or not habitable; provided that, if the shared building systems and/or common area costs allocated to one (1) or more units would cause those units to exceed the maximum total stated above, the excess allocated shared costs may be reallocated among the remaining units required to be offered for rent to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the total repair costs of such remaining units to exceed the maximum cost stated in subsection B of this section.
    3. The unit-specific costs of repairing low-income rental units shall be allocated to specific units.
    4. Costs of all capital repairs shall be included in calculating the owner's maximum contribution over a three (3) year period. The costs of ordinary maintenance shall not be included. For the purposes of this section, all repairs which are ordered to remedy code violations upon the first inspection of a rental unit under this chapter shall be deemed capital repairs; during subsequent inspections capital costs for repairs to correct code violations shall be counted only if the Director determines that such repairs are not ordinary maintenance.
    5. Any individual unit whose total unit-specific and allocated shared repair costs exceed the maximum allowed by this chapter shall be determined to be not feasible to repair.
4. The owner's required contribution to the repair of a unit shall be unlimited to the extent that the unit is not habitable because the owner has:

    1. Wilfully or wantonly failed to comply with applicable building and safety codes; or
    2. Committed or caused vandalism or the intentional destruction of any rental unit in the building; or
    3. Knowingly permitted a tenant to commit waste or to vandalize a rental unit.

#### 22.220.080 - Variances, deferrals and extended time for compliance.

1. In specific buildings containing low-income rental units, the Director may authorize under conditions specified in subsections B and C of this section the following types of departure from the standards and requirements of Sections 22.206.020 through 22.206.160 of the Housing Code (Chapter 22.206 of the Seattle Municipal Code):

    1. A variance;
    2. A deferral from compliance for up to three (3) years, with the possibility of one (1) renewal for up to an additional three (3) years;
    3. Extended time for compliance, with repair work scheduled over a period not to exceed eighteen (18) months, provided that such schedule is arranged to minimize as much as possible the amount of time a unit is not available for occupancy.
2. The Director may grant the departures authorized by this section if he or she determines that both of the following conditions or circumstances exist:

    1. A literal interpretation and strict application of the standards and requirements would result in an undue or unnecessary hardship, other than solely a financial hardship, and would adversely affect the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the owner or tenant of the subject building; and
    2. Because of the conditions or circumstances applying to the subject building or to the occupancy thereof, the departure will not be materially detrimental or injurious to the safety, health, or general welfare of the occupants thereof of neighboring property or occupancies or of the public.
3. In addition, in determining whether or not any departure from the requirements of the Housing Code is appropriate and, if so, whether to grant a variance, a deferral, or extended time for compliance, the Director shall consider, among others, the following factors:

    1. The remaining useful life of the unit or building and the length of time it is likely to be available for low-income occupancy;
    2. How materially the departure would affect the living conditions of the tenants;
    3. The permanency of the condition of the item, unit, structure, or system for which the departure is sought and the degree to which it might deteriorate over the period for which the departure is sought;
    4. The difficulty of bringing the item, unit, structure or system into compliance if the departure is not granted.
4. Examples of items which might be variances, deferred or given extended time for compliance are shown below. Since no two (2) buildings are ever alike and the nature and extent of violations could change over short periods of time, these examples would not apply in all cases. The examples stated below are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended as a complete or exclusive list of the items which may be deferred or the nature of the deferral which might be granted.

: Floor Area—This section provides for the minimum space and occupancy standards of the Housing Code. For example, a dwelling unit is required to have at least one (1) room which shall have not less than one hundred twenty (120) square feet of floor area, etc.... A variance could be granted where areas are (1) or two (2) percent smaller than required.

: Bathroom Fixtures—Lavatories are required to be provided on each floor at a rate of one (1) for every additional ten (10) guests, etc.... A variance can be granted for a lesser number of bathroom lavatories especially when rooms are equipped with operating lavatory sinks.

: Electrical—Kitchens are to be provided with not less than three (3) outlets. A variance can be granted to allow less than three (3) electrical outlets generally based on the small size of the kitchen.

: Kitchen—Every dwelling unit must be provided with a kitchen, and every kitchen must be provided with a sink, hot and cold running water, counter work space, cabinets, etc.… A deferral could be granted for the counter space requirement if a table is provided that could serve as counter space.

: Stair Construction—Every required stairway, except in dwellings are required to have headroom clearance of not less than six (6) feet six (6) inches measured vertically, etc.... A deferral could be granted, provided adequate padding and warning signs were installed.

: Structural Components—Structural components of buildings shall be reasonably decay free. A building that appears to have a limited useful life has window sills and sashes with dry rot. A deferral could be granted for dry rot in wooden window sills where no moisture is seeping through the sill and no weather is coming through the meeting of the sill and sash. A deferral could not be granted for dry rot in the window sash, since such dry rot would make the windows unsafe for tenants to use.

The deferral for the window sill could be revoked if, upon subsequent inspection, conditions had deteriorated and moisture was seeping into the wall or the room.

: Shelter—Every building shall be protected so as to provide shelter for the occupants against the weather. A building roof has a number of leaks and an inspection in November reveals that the building must be completely reroofed. Work to patch the leaks is ordered and scheduled immediately; an extension for reroofing is granted until late the following spring, to be scheduled when the weather is more accommodating.

: Maintenance—Every foundation, room and exterior wall, etc., shall be reasonably weathertight, watertight, damp free, etc. A large building has leaky mortar joints in the exterior walls, but an inspecting structural engineer has determined that the wall is sound enough to permit the owner an extended period of time during which to schedule the repair, e.g., two (2) sides during one (1) summer, the remaining two (2) sides during a second summer.


    1. Examples of items, which, under appropriate circumstances might be varianced include:
    2. Examples of items, which, under appropriate circumstances might be deferred include:
    3. Examples of items, for which, under appropriate circumstances an extended time for compliance might be authorized include:
5. The Director of Housing or his or her designee is hereby authorized to apply to the Director for any departure from the Housing and Building Maintenance Code authorized by this section. No other person is authorized to make such application.
6. If the Director determines after inspection of a unit or building that a condition or circumstance has changed which materially and detrimentally affects the health or safety of the tenants, their neighbors, or the general public, the Director may revoke an order granting a deferral or extended time for compliance.
7. In addition, the departures authorized under this section shall be automatically revoked for any unit which is no longer available for low-income occupancy as defined by this chapter.

#### 22.220.090 - Loans and grants to owners.

1. The Director of Housing may authorize loans and grants to owners and receivers from the Downtown Housing Maintenance Account described in Section 22.220.100 and/or from such Community Development Block Grant funds or other similarly restricted funds as may have been appropriated for the rehabilitation of rental units downtown or may in the future be appropriated specifically for the repair of low income rental units pursuant to this chapter. Such loans and grants shall be made only for the reasonable cost of repairs necessary to make low income rental units habitable and for the reasonable cost of any other repairs to the building in which such units are located which are necessary to make such units habitable. Such loans and grants shall be made only in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section.
2. The Director of Housing may make grants for repairs necessary to make low income rental units habitable. The maximum grant amount shall be Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000) per unit, to be awarded after the owner has committed his or her own maximum contribution to the repair of a unit.
3. The Director of Housing may extend loans for the repair of low income units as follows:

    1. The maximum loan amount shall be Six Thousand Dollars ($6,000) per unit.
    2. The Director of Housing may authorize the forgiveness of such loans at a rate of twenty (20) percent per year, with a maximum forgiveness of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per year for each year the unit remains available for low income occupancy, such forgiveness to continue until the entire amount has been forgiven; provided that the unit continues to be available for low income occupancy during the entire forgiveness period.
    3. The loans shall be made with no interest charged while the unit remains available for low income occupancy.
    4. If for any reason the units become unavailable for low income occupancy, the remainder of the loan shall be required to be repaid, and in addition the Director of Housing may require the immediate repayment of the remaining balance or said Director of Housing may charge interest on the remaining balance at the then prevailing rate for the Washington State Housing Finance Commission bond program.
4. The total amount of grants and loans authorized under this section shall not exceed Six Thousand Dollars ($6,000) per unit for any three (3) year period.
5. The Director of Housing shall prescribe such additional terms and conditions of such loans and grants as he or she deems appropriate. Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the Director of Housing shall promulgate regulations describing the circumstances under which loans and grants will be approved and the general terms and conditions of such loans and grants.

#### 22.220.100 - Downtown Housing Maintenance Account.

1. There is hereby created in the City Treasury an account in the Low-Income Housing Fund designated the "Downtown Housing Maintenance Account," from which account grants and loans as specified in Section 22.220.090 of this chapter may be made to owners or receivers to assist them in placing low-income rental units in habitable condition and from which account shall be paid costs and expenses incurred by the City in connection with the repair of low-income rental units or buildings that can feasibly be made habitable.
2. Money from the following sources shall be deposited in the fund:

    1. Such sums as may be received by gift, bequest or contractual arrangement for maintenance and rehabilitation of downtown low-income rental housing purposes; and
    2. Such sums as may be recovered by the City as repayment of loans or as reimbursement of costs or expenses of repair of units that were found to be uninhabitable where such funds originated from this account.
3. The moneys in the account are hereby appropriated for the purposes described above and the Director of Finance and Administrative Services is authorized to draw and to pay the necessary warrants upon vouchers approved by the Director of Housing from the appropriated account.

Special Hazards Permits.

Fees for special hazards permits are established in Schedule C (See Table 22.602.045 C). In some cases these fees are based on the quantity of hazardous material stored and/or handled at the site and the relative risk posed by each material.


1. Definitions:

    1. "Quantity Range Number," as established in the Quantity Range Table below, is a number between 1 and 2 that is assigned to a hazard category based upon the amount of hazardous material located at the site.

1. "Assigned Risk Factor," as established below, is a number between 1 and 1.5 assigned to each hazard class and category of hazardous material indicating the relative hazard posed by materials in that hazard category and the potential nature of controls required by the Fire Code.

Base permit fee = [σ (Q)(R) + (Q)(R)…] [F]


Where:


Q = The quantity range number.

R = The assigned risk factor.

F = The fixed permit cost $218.

When an individual material has multiple hazards, only the hazard presented by the hazard class that has been assigned the highest risk factor shall be considered in the fee calculation.

Example:


XYZ Company stores 50 gallons of gasoline and 200 gallons of 50% nitric acid. Gasoline is classified as a Class I flammable liquid which has an assigned risk factor of 1.4. Nitric acid (50%) is classified as both a corrosive liquid and a Class 2 oxidizer. Because 50% nitric acid presents two separate hazards (corrosive and Class 2 oxidizer) only the Class 2 oxidizer hazard is considered in the fee calculation because it has an assigned risk factor of 1.2 compared to the 1.1 risk factor assigned to corrosives.

Base permit fee = [(1)(1.4) + (1.25)(1.2)] [$218]

Base permit fee = $632.20


1. "Fixed permit cost" is the minimum cost for the Seattle Fire Department to issue a hazardous material permit. The fixed permit cost is $208.
2. "Base permit fee" is determined by multiplying the sum of the products of the quantity range number and assigned risk factor for each hazard class by the fixed permit cost and is represented by the following equation:

4. All permits listed under Schedule A, B, and C of this section, except for those permits for which a time charge is indicated, have a base fee which incorporates the cost of an initial site inspection, one site reinspection if required, and related administrative time to determine compliance with the Seattle Fire Code. Any subsequent inspections will result in a fee based on a time charge which shall be actual labor costs plus administrative overhead costs for field inspection and review time exceeding one hour. Such fees shall include overtime costs only when the work performed outside normal business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday) is required by the Seattle Fire Code or is performed at the request of the owner or responsible person or permit holder.
5. Temporary permits listed under Schedule A, B and C will not be renewed on an annual basis.
6. Those permit applications that are required to be filed within time limitations specified under the Seattle Fire Code or by order of the Fire Chief or his designee shall be subject to a late fee if not filed within the prescribed time period. Any work activity or operation regulated by the code that commences before obtaining the necessary permits may be required to obtain a permit and pay 1.5 times the fee of the original permit. Where a compliance plan agreement has been reached for a permitted activity, the fire code official is authorized to require temporary permits to be issued in lieu of an annual permit until full compliance with the fire code regulations for that activity is achieved. The fee for such temporary permits shall be based on the cost of an annual permit pro-rated for the time period the temporary permit is valid.
7. Payment for fixed rate Schedule C permit renewals that is received more than 30 calendar days but fewer than 91 calendar days past the permit expiration date shall be equal to 1.25 times the renewal fee. The renewal permit will be valid for only one year from the expiration date of the prior permit. Permits for which no renewal payment has been received within 90 calendar days following the permit expiration date will be cancelled. Permits that have been cancelled may be reinstated, effective from the expiration date, if the permit holder pays a late penalty of 1.5 times the fee for an original permit within 180 days of the expiration date. Thereafter, any person whose permit has been cancelled shall not be allowed to reinstate the cancelled permit, but shall be required to submit a new permit application and pay a late penalty of 1.5 times the fee for an original permit.
8. Payment for Schedule C worksheet-based permit fees listed under Schedule C as renewable, that is more than 30 calendar days, but fewer than 91 calendar days, past the permit expiration date, shall be equal to 1.75 times the renewal amount. The renewal permit will be valid for only one year from the expiration date of the prior permit. Permits for which no renewal payment has been received within 90 calendar days following the permit expiration date will be cancelled. Permits that have been cancelled may be reinstated, effective from the expiration date, if the permit holder pays a late penalty of 1.25 times the fee for an original permit within 180 days of the expiration date. Thereafter, any person whose permit has been cancelled shall not be allowed to reinstate the cancelled permit, but shall be required to submit a new permit application and pay a late penalty of 1.25 times the fee for an original permit.
9. Unless specifically stated on the permit, no temporary use permit shall be valid for a term exceeding 12 months.
10. In special circumstances, permit fees may be adjusted, modified or combined. Authority to adjust, modify or combine such permit fees is limited to the Fire Chief, the Fire Marshal and the Assistant Fire Marshal.
11. For permits listed in Schedules A, B and C, when the Fire Marshal determines that standby fire personnel or subsequent inspections beyond those provided for in paragraph D. above are essential in order to obtain compliance with the fire code or for the public safety of an existing or proposed activity, building or structure, or for the safety of the occupants thereof, actual costs for labor including applicable administrative overhead and other services shall be charged to the permit holder or other responsible party.
12. Fees for certification examinations are established in Schedule L. Each examination fee listed under Schedule L includes one test and one opportunity to retake the test under the following "re-test" conditions: the person taking the examination does not pass the examination the first time and the "re-test" occurs within 90 calendar days of the original test. Upon successfully passing a certification examination, and upon providing evidence of current State of Washington certification if required by State law for that certification type, the person who took the test will be certified by the City of Seattle for that certification type for one year. The certification may be renewed for two subsequent years at no cost to the licensee. The licensee will, however, need to demonstrate continued competence and continue to comply with State regulations where applicable as a condition of certification renewal. The renewal of the license will be denied if the Seattle Fire Department becomes informed and verifies that the licensee no longer meets the qualifications for the license. Testing is required once every three years.

## Subtitle VIII. - Stormwater Code
### Chapter 22.800 - TITLE, PURPOSE, SCOPE AND AUTHORITY

Sections:

#### 22.800.010 - Title

This subtitle, comprised of Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, shall be known as the "Stormwater Code" and may be cited as such.


#### 22.800.020 - Purpose

1. The provisions of this subtitle shall be liberally construed to accomplish its remedial purposes, which are:

    1. To protect, to the greatest extent practicable, life, property and the environment from loss, injury and damage by pollution, erosion, flooding, landslides, strong ground motion, soil liquefaction, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence, and other potential hazards, whether from natural causes or from human activity;
    2. To protect the public interest in drainage and related functions of drainage basins, watercourses and shoreline areas;
    3. To protect receiving waters from pollution, mechanical damage, excessive flows and other conditions in their drainage basins which will increase the rate of downcutting, streambank erosion, and/or the degree of turbidity, siltation and other forms of pollution, or which will reduce their low flows or low levels to levels which degrade the environment, reduce recharging of groundwater, or endanger aquatic and benthic life within these receiving waters and receiving waters of the state;
    4. To meet the requirements of state and federal law and the City's municipal stormwater National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit;
    5. To protect the functions and values of environmentally critical areas as required under the state's Growth Management Act and Shoreline Management Act;
    6. To protect the public drainage system from loss, injury and damage by pollution, erosion, flooding, landslides, strong ground motion, soil liquefaction, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence, and other potential hazards, whether from natural causes or from human activity; and
    7. To fulfill the responsibilities of the City as trustee of the environment for future generations.
2. It is expressly the purpose of this subtitle to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public. This subtitle is not intended to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by its terms.
3. It is expressly acknowledged that water quality degradation can result either directly from one discharge or through the collective impact of many small discharges. Therefore, the water quality protection measures in this subtitle are necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of Seattle and the integrity of natural resources for the benefit of all and for the purposes of this subtitle. Such water quality protection measures are required under the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. Section 1251, et seq., and in response to the obligations of the City's municipal stormwater discharge permit, issued by the State of Washington under the federal NPDES program.

#### 22.800.030 - Scope and Applicability

This subtitle applies to:


1. All grading and drainage and erosion control, whether or not a permit is required;
2. All land disturbing activities, whether or not a permit is required;
3. All discharges directly or indirectly to a public drainage system or a public combined sewer;
4. All discharges directly or indirectly into receiving waters within or contiguous to Seattle city limits;
5. All new and existing land uses; and
6. All real property.

    6. With respect to all state highway right-of-way under Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) control within the jurisdiction of the City of Seattle, WSDOT shall use the current, approved Highway Runoff Manual (HRM) for its existing and new facilities and rights-of-way, as addressed in WAC 173-270-030(1) and (2). Exceptions to this exemption, where more stringent stormwater management requirements apply, are addressed in WAC 173-270-030(3)(b) and (c).

        1. When a state highway is located in the jurisdiction of a local government that is required by Ecology to use more stringent standards to protect the quality of receiving waters, WSDOT shall comply with the same standards to promote uniform stormwater management.
        2. WSDOT shall comply with standards identified in watershed action plans for WSDOT rights-of-way, to the extent required by state law.
        3. Other instances where more stringent local stormwater standards apply are projects subject to tribal government standards or to the stormwater management-related permit conditions imposed under Chapter 25.09 to protect environmentally critical areas and their buffers (under the Growth Management Act), an NPDES permit, or shoreline master programs (under the Shoreline Management Act). In addition, WSDOT shall comply with local jurisdiction stormwater standards when WSDOT elects, and is granted permission, to discharge stormwater runoff into a municipality's drainage system or combined sewer system.
2. Adjustments

    1. The Director may approve a request for adjustments to the requirements of this subtitle when the Director finds that:

        1. The adjustment provides substantially equivalent environmental protection; and
        2. The objectives of safety, function, environmental protection, and facility maintenance are met, based on sound engineering practices.
    2. During construction, the Director may require, or the applicant may request, that the construction of drainage control facilities and associated project designs be adjusted if physical conditions are discovered on the site that are inconsistent with the assumptions upon which the approval was based, including but not limited to unexpected soil and/or water conditions, weather generated problems, or changes in the design of the improved areas.
    3. A request by the applicant for adjustments shall be submitted to the Director for approval prior to implementation. The request shall be in writing and shall provide facts substantiating the requirements of subsection 22.800.040.B.1 and, if made during construction, the factors in subsection B.2. Any such modifications made during the construction of drainage control facilities shall be recorded on the final approved drainage control plan, a revised copy of which shall be filed by the Director.
3. Exceptions

    1. The Director may approve a request for an exception to the requirements of this subtitle when the applicant demonstrates that the exception will not increase risks in the vicinity and/or downstream of the property to public health, safety and welfare, or to water quality, or to public and private property, and:

        1. The requirement would cause a severe and unexpected financial hardship that outweighs the requirement's benefits, and the criteria for an adjustment cannot be met; or
        2. The requirement would cause harm or a significant threat of harm to public health, safety and welfare, the environment, or public and private property, and the criteria for an adjustment cannot be met; or
        3. The requirement is not technically feasible, and the criteria for an adjustment cannot be met; or
        4. An emergency situation exists that necessitates approval of the exception.
    2. An exception shall only be granted to the extent necessary to provide relief from the economic hardship, to alleviate the harm or threat of harm, to the degree that compliance with the requirement becomes technically feasible, or to perform the emergency work that the Director determines exists.
    3. An applicant is not entitled to an exception, whether or not the criteria allowing approval of an exception are met.
    4. The Director may require an applicant to provide additional information at the applicant's expense, including, but not limited to, an engineer's report or analysis.
    5. When an exception is granted, the Director may impose new or additional requirements to offset or mitigate harm that may be caused by granting the exception, or that would have been prevented if the exception had not been granted.
    6. Public notice of an application for an exception and of the Director's decision on the application shall be provided in the manner prescribed for Type II land use decisions, as set forth in Chapter 23.76.
    7. The Director's decision shall be in writing with written findings of fact. Decisions approving an exception based on severe and unexpected economic hardship shall address all the factors in subsection 22.800.040.C.8.
    8. An application for an exception on the grounds of severe and unexpected financial hardship must describe, at a minimum, all of the following:

All projects are required to meet each of the elements below or document why an element is not applicable. Additional controls may be required by the Director when minimum controls are not sufficient to prevent erosion or transport of sediment or other pollutants from the site.

    1. Mark Clearing Limits and Environmentally Critical Areas. Within the boundaries of the project site and prior to beginning land disturbing activities, including clearing and grading, clearly mark all clearing limits, easements, setbacks, all environmentally critical areas and their buffers, and all trees and drainage courses that are to be preserved within the construction area.
    2. Retain Top Layer. Within the boundaries of the project site, the duff layer, topsoil, and native vegetation, if there is any, shall be retained in an undisturbed state to the maximum extent feasible. If it is not feasible to retain the top layer in place, it should be stockpiled on-site, covered to prevent erosion, and replaced immediately upon completion of the land disturbing activities to the maximum extent feasible.
    3. Establish Construction Access. Limit construction vehicle access, whenever possible, to one route. Stabilize access points and minimize tracking sediment onto public roads. Promptly remove any sediment tracked off site.
    4. Protect Downstream Properties and Receiving Waters. Protect properties and receiving waters downstream from the development sites from erosion due to increases in the volume, velocity, and peak flow rate of drainage water from the project site. If it is necessary to construct flow control facilities to meet this requirement, these facilities shall be functioning prior to implementation of other land disturbing activity. If permanent infiltration facilities are used to control flows during construction, these facilities shall be protected from siltation during the construction phase of the project.
    5. Prevent Erosion and Sediment Transport from the Site. Pass all drainage water from disturbed areas through a sediment trap, sediment pond, or other appropriate sediment removal BMP before the water leaves the site or prior to discharge to an infiltration facility. Sediment controls intended to trap sediment on site shall be constructed as one of the first steps in grading and shall be functional before other land disturbing activities take place. BMPs intended to trap sedimentation shall be located in a manner to avoid interference with the movement of juvenile salmonids attempting to enter off-channel areas or drainages.
    6. Prevent Erosion and Sediment Transport from the Site by Vehicles. Whenever construction vehicle access routes intersect paved roads, the transport of sediment onto the paved road shall be minimized. If sediment is transported onto a paved road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day. Sediment shall be removed from paved roads by shoveling or sweeping and shall be transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. If sediment is tracked off site, roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or at least twice daily during wet weather. Street washing is allowed only after sediment is removed, and street wash wastewater shall be prevented from entering the drainage system and receiving waters.
    7. Stabilize Soils. Prevent on-site erosion by stabilizing all exposed and unworked soils, including stock piles and earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions. From October 1 to April 30, no soils shall remain exposed and unworked for more than two days. From May 1 to September 30, no soils shall remain exposed for more than seven days. Soils shall be stabilized at the end of the shift before a holiday or weekend if needed based on the weather forecast. Soil stockpiles shall be stabilized from erosion, protected with sediment trapping measures, and be located away from storm drain inlets, waterways, and drainage channels. Before the completion of the project, permanently stabilize all exposed soils that have been disturbed during construction.
    8. Protect Slopes. Erosion from slopes shall be minimized. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion. Off-site stormwater run-on or groundwater shall be diverted away from slopes and undisturbed areas with interceptor dikes, pipes, and/or swales. Pipe slope drains or protected channels shall be constructed at the top of slopes to collect drainage and prevent erosion. Excavated material shall be placed on the uphill side of trenches, consistent with safety and space considerations. Check dams shall be placed at regular intervals within constructed channels that are cut down a slope.
    9. Protect Storm Drains. Prevent sediment from entering all storm drains, including ditches that receive drainage water from the project. Storm drain inlets protection devices shall be cleaned or removed and replaced as recommended by the product manufacturer, or more frequently if required to prevent failure of the device or flooding. Storm drain inlets made operable during construction shall be protected so that drainage water does not enter the drainage system without first being filtered or treated to remove sediments. Storm drain inlet protection devices shall be removed at the conclusion of the project. When manufactured storm drain inlet protection devices are not feasible, inlets and catch basins must be cleaned as necessary to prevent sediment from entering the drainage control system.
    10. Stabilize Channels and Outlets. All temporary on-site drainage systems shall be designed, constructed, and stabilized to prevent erosion. Stabilization shall be provided at the outlets of all drainage systems that is adequate to prevent erosion of outlets, adjacent stream banks, slopes, and downstream reaches.

#### 22.805.080 - Minimum Requirements for Flow Control

Before authorizing new discharges to a wetland, alternative discharge locations shall be evaluated and infiltration options outside the wetland shall be maximized unless doing so will adversely impact the functions and values of the affected wetlands. If one or more of the flow control requirements contained in 22.805.080.B.2 through 22.805.080.B.4 also apply to the project, an analysis shall be conducted to ensure that the functions and values of the affected wetland are protected before implementing these flow control requirements. Projects triggering this requirement shall refer to Guide Sheets #1 through #3 presented in Appendix I-D of Ecology's Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington (Ecology 2014) for additional guidance. Notwithstanding any provision in this subtitle, no net loss of wetland functions of values shall result from actions regulated by this subtitle.


1. Pre-developed Forested Standard. The post-development discharge durations shall match the discharge durations of a pre-developed forested condition for the range of pre-developed discharge rates from 50 percent of the 2-year peak flow to the 50-year peak flow.
2. Pre-developed Pasture Standard. The post-development discharge durations shall match the discharge durations of a pre-developed pasture condition for the range of pre-developed discharge rates from 50 percent of the 2-year peak flow to the 2-year peak flow.
3. Peak Control Standard. The post-development peak flow with a 4 percent annual probability (25-year recurrence flow) shall not exceed 0.4 cubic feet per second per acre. Additionally, the peak flow with a 50 percent annual probability (recurrence flow) shall not exceed 0.15 cubic feet per second per acre.

1. Applicability. The requirements of this subsection apply to the extent required in Section 22.805.050 to Section 22.805.060.
2. Requirements. Flow control facilities shall be installed to the extent allowed by law and maintained pursuant to rules promulgated by the Director to receive flows from that portion of the site being developed. Post-development discharge determination must include flows from dewatering activities. All projects shall use on-site BMPs identified in Section 22.805.070.D to the maximum extent feasible to meet the minimum requirements. Flow control facilities that receive flows from less than that portion of the site being developed may be installed if the total new plus replaced impervious surface is less than 10,000 square feet, the project site uses only on-site BMPs to meet the requirement, and the on-site BMPs provides substantially equivalent environmental protection as facilities not using on-site BMPs that receive flows from all of the portion of the site being developed.

during a single precipitation event, 20 percent higher or lower than the pre-project volume, and

on a monthly basis, 15 percent higher or lower than the pre-project volume.


    1. Wetland Protection Standard. Protect the functions and values of wetlands and their buffers from all projects discharging stormwater directly or indirectly to them. The hydrologic conditions, vegetative community, and substrate characteristics of the wetlands shall be protected, and impacts caused by changes in water flows and pollutants shall be prevented. The introduction of sediment, heat and other pollutants and contaminants into wetlands shall be minimized through the selection, design, installation, and maintenance of temporary and permanent controls. The total volume of stormwater discharging into a wetland shall not be more than:
3. Inspection and Maintenance Schedule. Temporary and permanent flow control facilities shall be inspected and maintained according to rules promulgated by the Director to keep these facilities in continuous working order.

1. Applicability. The requirements of this subsection apply to the extent required in Section 22.805.050 to Section 22.805.060.
2. Requirements. Water quality treatment facilities shall be installed to the extent allowed by law and maintained pursuant to rules promulgated by the Director to treat flows from the pollution-generating pervious and impervious surfaces on the site being developed. When stormwater flows from other areas, including non-pollution generating surfaces (e.g., roofs), dewatering activities, and off-site areas, cannot be separated or bypassed, treatment BMPs shall be designed for the entire area draining to the treatment facility. All projects shall use on-site BMPs identified in Section 22.805.070.D to the maximum extent feasible to meet the minimum requirements.

    1. Runoff Volume. Stormwater treatment facilities shall be designed based on the stormwater runoff volume from the contributing area or a peak flow rate as follows:

        1. The daily runoff volume at or below which 91 percent of the total runoff volume for the simulation period occurs, as determined using an approved continuous model. It is calculated as follows:

            1. Rank the daily runoff volumes from highest to lowest.
            2. Sum all the daily volumes and multiply by 0.09.
            3. Sequentially sum daily runoff volumes, starting with the highest value, until the total equals 9 percent of the total runoff volume. The last daily value added to the sum is defined as the water quality design volume.
        2. Different design flow rates are required depending on whether a treatment facility will be located upstream or downstream of a detention facility:

            1. For facilities located upstream of detention or when detention is not required, the design flow rate is the flow rate at or below which 91 percent of the total runoff volume for the simulation period is treated, as determined using an approved continuous runoff model.
            2. For facilities located downstream of detention, the design flow rate is the release rate shall be the full 2-year release rate, as determined using an approved continuous runoff model.
        3. Infiltration facilities designed for water quality treatment must infiltrate 91 percent of the total runoff volume as determined using an approved continuous runoff model. To prevent the onset of anaerobic conditions, an infiltration facility designed for water quality treatment purposes must be designed to drain the water quality design treatment volume (the 91st percentile, 24-hour volume) within 48 hours.
    2. Basic Treatment. A basic treatment facility shall be required for all projects. The requirements of subsection 22.805.090.B.3 (Oil Control Treatment), subsection 22.805.090.B.4 (Phosphorus Treatment), and subsection 22.805.090.B.5 (Enhanced Treatment) are in addition to this basic treatment requirement.
    3. Oil Control Treatment. An oil control treatment facility shall be required for high-use sites, as defined in this subtitle.
    4. Phosphorus Treatment. A phosphorus treatment facility shall be required for projects discharging into nutrient-critical receiving waters.
    5. Enhanced Treatment. An enhanced treatment facility for reducing concentrations of dissolved metals shall be required for projects that discharge, directly or through conveyance systems, to fresh waters designated for aquatic life use or having an existing aquatic life use, or that use infiltration strictly for flow control (not treatment) and discharge within one-quarter mile of fresh waters designated for aquatic life use or having an existing aquatic life use, if the project meets one of the following criteria:

        1. For a parcel-based project, the site is an industrial, commercial, or multi-family project.
        2. For a roadway project, the site is either:

            1. A fully controlled or a partially controlled limited access highway with Annual Average Daily Traffic counts of 15,000 or more; or
            2. Any other road with an Annual Average Daily Traffic count of 7,500 or greater.
    6. Discharges to Groundwater. Direct discharge of untreated drainage water from pollution-generating hard surfaces to groundwater is prohibited.
3. Inspection and Maintenance Schedule. Temporary and permanent treatment facilities shall be inspected and maintained according to rules promulgated by the Director to keep these facilities in continuous working order.

        4. Anyone violating this subtitle who has had a judgment, final Director's order, or Director's review decision against them for a prior violation of this subtitle in the preceding five years.

#### 22.808.020 - Liability and Defenses of Responsible Parties

1. Who Must Comply. It is the specific intent of this subtitle to place the obligation of complying with its requirements upon the responsible parties, as defined in subsection 22.801.190. The City and its agencies are intended to have the same obligation for compliance when the City is a responsible party. No provision of this subtitle is intended to impose any other duty upon the City or any of its officers or employees.

    1. Joint and Several Liability. Each responsible party is jointly and severally liable for a violation of this subtitle. The Director may take enforcement action, in whole or in part, against any responsible party. All applicable civil penalties may be imposed against each responsible party.
    2. Allocation of Damages. In the event enforcement action is taken against more than one responsible party, recoverable damages, costs, and expenses may be allocated among the responsible parties by the court based upon the extent to which each responsible party's acts or omissions caused the violation. If this factor cannot be determined the court may consider:

        1. Awareness of the violation;
        2. Ability to correct the violation;
        3. Ability to pay the damages, costs, and expenses;
        4. Cooperation with government agencies;
        5. Degree to which any impact or threatened impact on water or sediment quality, human health, the environment, or public or private property is related to acts or omissions by each responsible party;
        6. Degree to which the responsible parties made good-faith efforts to avoid a violation or to mitigate its consequences; and
        7. Other equitable factors.
2. Defenses. A responsible party shall not be liable under this subtitle when the responsible party proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, one of the following:

    1. The violation was caused solely by an act of God;
    2. The violation was caused solely by another responsible party over whom the defending responsible party had no authority or control and the defending responsible party could not have reasonably prevented the violation;
    3. The violation was caused solely by a prior owner or occupant when the defending responsible party took possession of the property without knowledge of the violation, after using reasonable efforts to identify violations. But, the defending responsible party shall be liable for all continuing, recurrent, or new violations after becoming the owner or occupant; or
    4. The responsible party implemented and maintained all appropriate drainage control facilities, treatment facilities, flow control facilities, erosion and sediment controls, source controls, and best management practices identified in rules promulgated by the Director or in manuals published by Ecology, or as otherwise identified and required of the responsible party by the Director in writing.

#### 22.808.025 - Right of Entry for Enforcement

With the consent of the owner or occupant of a building, premises, or property, or pursuant to a lawfully issued warrant, the Director may enter a building, premises, or property at any reasonable time to perform the duties imposed by this code.


#### 22.808.030 - Enforcement Actions

1. Investigation. The Director may investigate any site where there is reason to believe that there may be a failure to comply with the requirements of this subtitle.
2. Notice of Violation

    1. Issuance. The Director is authorized to issue a Notice of Violation to a responsible party whenever the Director determines that a violation of this subtitle has occurred or is occurring. The Notice of Violation shall be considered an order of the Director.
    2. Contents

        1. The Notice of Violation shall include the following information:

            1. A description of the violation and the action necessary to correct it;
            2. The date of the notice; and
            3. A deadline by which the action necessary to correct the violation must be completed.
        2. A Notice of Violation may be amended at any time to correct clerical errors, add citations of authority, or modify required corrective action.
    3. Service. The Director shall serve the notice upon a responsible party either by personal service, by first-class mail, or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the party's last known address. If by first-class mail, service shall be deemed complete upon the third day following the day upon which the notice is placed in the mail, or if the third day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, then on the next day following that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. If the address of the responsible party cannot be found after a reasonable search, the notice may be served by posting a copy of the notice at a conspicuous place on the property. Alternatively, if the whereabouts of the responsible party is unknown and cannot be ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the Director makes an affidavit to that effect, then service may be accomplished by publishing the notice once each week for two consecutive weeks in the City official newspaper.
    4. Nothing in this subtitle shall be deemed to obligate or require the Director to issue a Notice of Violation or order prior to the initiation of enforcement action by the City Attorney's Office pursuant to subsection 22.808.030.E.
3. Stop Work and Emergency Orders

    1. Stop Work Order. The Director may order work on a site stopped when the Director determines it is necessary to do so in order to obtain compliance with or to correct a violation of any provision of this subtitle or rules promulgated hereunder, or to correct a violation of a permit or approval granted under this subtitle.

        1. The stop work notice shall contain the following information:

            1. A description of the violation; and
            2. An order that the work be stopped until corrective action has been completed and approved by the Director.
        2. The stop work order shall be personally served on the responsible party or posted conspicuously on the premises.
    2. Emergency Order

        1. The Director may order a responsible party to take emergency corrective action and set a schedule for compliance and/or may require immediate compliance with an emergency order to correct when the Director determines that it is necessary to do so in order to obtain immediate compliance with or to correct a violation of any provision of this subtitle, or to correct a violation of a permit or approval granted under this subtitle.
        2. An emergency order shall be personally served on the responsible party or posted conspicuously on the premises.
        3. The Director is authorized to enter any property to investigate and correct a condition associated with grading, drainage, erosion control, drainage water, or a drainage control facility when it reasonably appears that the condition creates a substantial and present or imminent danger to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or public or private property. The Director may enter property without permission or an administrative warrant in the case of an extreme emergency placing human life, property, or the environment in immediate and substantial jeopardy which requires corrective action before either permission or an administrative warrant can be obtained. The cost of such emergency corrective action shall be collected as set forth in subsection 22.808.060.
    3. Director's Review of Stop Work and Emergency Order. A stop work order or emergency order shall be final and not subject to a Director's review.
4. Review by Director.

    1. A Notice of Violation, Director's order, or invoice issued pursuant to this subtitle shall be final and not subject to further appeal unless an aggrieved party requests in writing a review by the Director within ten business days after service of the Notice of Violation, order or invoice. When the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day.
    2. Following receipt of a request for review, the Director shall notify the requesting party, any persons served the Notice of Violation, order or invoice, and any person who has requested notice of the review, that the request for review has been received by the Director. Additional information for consideration as part of the review shall be submitted to the Director no later than 15 business days after the written request for a review is mailed.
    3. The Director will review the basis for issuance of the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice and all information received by the deadline for submission of additional information for consideration as part of the review. The Director may request clarification of information received and a site visit. After the review is completed, the Director may:

        1. Sustain the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice;
        2. Withdraw the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice;
        3. Continue the review to a date certain for receipt of additional information; or
        4. Modify or amend the Notice of Violation, order, or invoice.
    4. The Director's decision shall become final and is not subject to further administrative appeal.
5. Referral to City Attorney for Enforcement. If a responsible party fails to correct a violation or pay a penalty as required by a Notice of Violation, or fails to comply with a Director's order, the Director may refer the matter to the City Attorney's Office for civil or criminal enforcement action. Civil actions to enforce this subtitle shall be exclusively in Municipal Court.
6. Appeal to Superior Court. Because civil actions to enforce Title 22 are brought exclusively in Municipal Court, notices of violation, orders, and all other actions made under this subtitle are not subject to judicial review under chapter 36.70C RCW. Instead, final decisions of the Municipal Court on enforcement actions authorized by this subtitle may be appealed under the Rules for Appeal of Decisions of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction.
7. Filing of Notice or Order. A Notice of Violation, voluntary compliance agreement, or an order issued by the Director or court may be filed with the King County Recorder's Office.
8. Change of Ownership. When a Notice of Violation, voluntary compliance agreement, or an order issued by the Director or court has been filed with the King County Recorder's Office, a Notice of Violation or an order regarding the same violations need not be served upon a new owner of the property where the violation occurred. If no Notice of Violation or order is served upon the new owner, the Director may grant the new owner the same number of days to comply as was given the previous owner. The compliance period for the new owner shall begin on the date that the conveyance of title to the new owner is completed.

#### 22.808.040 - Voluntary Compliance Agreement

1. Initiation. Either a responsible party or the Director may initiate negotiations for a voluntary compliance agreement at any time. Neither has any obligation to enter into any voluntary compliance agreement.
2. Contents. A voluntary compliance agreement shall identify actions to be taken by the responsible party that will correct past or existing violations of this subtitle. The agreement may also identify actions to mitigate the impacts of violations. The agreement shall contain a schedule for completion of the corrective actions and any mitigating actions. The agreement shall contain a provision allowing the Director to inspect the premises to determine compliance with the agreement. The agreement shall provide that the responsible party agrees the City may perform the actions set forth in the agreement if the responsible party fails to do so according to the terms and schedule of the agreement, and the responsible party will pay the costs, expenses and damages the City incurs in performing the actions, as set forth in Section 22.808.060.
3. Effect of Agreement

    1. A voluntary compliance agreement is a binding contract between the party executing it and the City. It is not enforceable by any other party. By entering into a voluntary compliance agreement, a responsible party waives the right to Director's review of the Notice of Violation or order.
    2. Penalties may be reduced or waived if violations are corrected or mitigated according to the terms and schedule of a voluntary compliance agreement. If the responsible party fails to perform according to the terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance agreement, penalties for each violation addressed in the agreement may be assessed starting from the date the violation occurred, or as otherwise provided for in a Notice of Violation or Director's order.
4. Modification. The terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance agreement may be modified by mutual agreement of the responsible party and either Director if circumstances or conditions outside the responsible party's control, or unknown at the time the agreement was made, or other just cause necessitate such modifications.

#### 22.808.050 - Penalties and Damages

1. Assessment of Penalties by the Director. The Director, after considering all available information, may assess a penalty for each violation of this subtitle based upon the Schedule of Civil Penalties in subsection 22.808.050.B.
2. Schedule of Civil Penalties. The Director shall determine penalties as follows:

    1. Basic Penalty.

        1. Maximum Penalty. A violation of this subtitle is subject to a maximum civil penalty of up to $5,000. Each day or portion thereof during which a violation of this subtitle exists is a separate violation of this subtitle.
        2. Commencement Date. The penalty shall commence on the date of the violation, unless otherwise provided for in a Notice of Violation or Director's order.
        3. Assessment Matrix. The penalty shall be assessed using a matrix of criteria and scored as defined in rules promulgated by the Director. The total score will equate with a penalty up to a maximum of $5,000 for each violation. The penalty shall be rated for severity by using the criteria listed below and by answering "No", "Possibly", "Probably", or "Definitely":

            1. Did the violation pose a public health risk?
            2. Did the violation result in environmental damage or adverse impacts to infrastructure?
            3. Was the action a willful and knowing violation?
            4. Was the responsible party unresponsive in correcting the violation?
            5. Was the violation a result of improper operation, inadequate maintenance or inadequate implementation of a required plan that addresses stormwater management (e.g. TESC plans, SWPPP, O&M Manual, DCP)?
            6. Did the responsible party fail to obtain and comply with relevant permits, certifications, and approvals that require or would have required the responsible party to manage stormwater in a manner that could have prevented or mitigated the Code violation?
            7. Did anyone benefit economically from non-compliance?
            8. Was the violation a repeat violation?
3. Penalty for Significant Violation. For violations causing significant harm to public health, safety, welfare, the environment, or private or public property, the Director may, as an alternative to the Basic Penalty, refer the matter to the City Attorney's Office for enforcement and request the City Attorney seek a penalty equivalent to the economic benefit the responsible party derived from the violation. Significant harm is damage or injury which cannot be fully corrected or mitigated by the responsible party, and which cannot be adequately compensated for by assessment of the Basic Penalty and costs, expenses, or damages under this subtitle. Economic benefit may be determined by savings in costs realized by the responsible party, value received by the responsible party, increased income to the responsible party, increase in market value of property, or any other method reasonable under the circumstances.
4. Damages. Whoever violates any of the provisions of this subtitle shall, in addition to any penalties provided for such violation, be liable for any: investigation cost, cost to correct or any other cost expense; loss or damage incurred by the City; plus a charge of 15 percent for administrative costs. This subtitle does not establish a cause of action that may be asserted by any party other than the City. Penalties, damages, costs and expenses may be recovered only by the City.
5. Effect of Payment of Penalties. The responsible party named in a Notice of Violation or order is not relieved of the duty to correct the violation by paying civil penalties.

#### 22.808.060 - Collection of Costs and Penalties

1. Invoice and Demand for Payment of Investigation and Correction Costs. The Director may issue an invoice and demand for payment of the City's costs and expenses when the Director has investigated or corrected a violation of this subtitle. The invoice may include:

        5. Inspections for compliance with the Code, documentation of costs, and invoicing the responsible party;
        6. Cost of equipment, materials, and supplies, including all related expenses for purchasing, renting, and leasing;
        7. Laboratory costs and analytical expenses;
        8. Cost of mobilization, disposal of materials, and cleanup; and

    4. Notice that if the amount due is not paid within 30 days, the unpaid amount may be collected in any of the manners identified in subsection 22.808.060.C; and
    5. Notice that interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance if not paid within 30 days after the invoice date.
2. Invoice and Demand for Payment of Civil Penalties. The Director may issue an invoice and demand for payment of civil penalties when the responsible party has failed to pay a penalty by the deadline in a Notice of Violation or order and has failed to request a Director's review or file an appeal within the required time periods established in subsection 22.808.030.D. The invoice shall include:

    1. The amount of the penalty;
    2. Either a legal description of the property corresponding as nearly as possible to that used for the property on the rolls of the King County Assessor or, where available, the property's street address;
    3. Notice that if the amount due is not paid within 30 days, the Director may collect the unpaid amount in any lawful manner, including, but not limited to, referral of the matter to a collection agency; and
    4. Notice that interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance if not paid within 30 days after the invoice date.
3. Collection Following a Judicial Review or Issuance of a Court Order Affirming the Penalty Due. If a court has issued an order or judgment imposing penalties, costs, damages, or expenses for a violation of this subtitle, and the court's order or judgment is not appealed within 30 days, the Director may:

    1. Refer the matter to the City Attorney to initiate any appropriate legal action in an appropriate forum; or
    2. Add a surcharge in the amount owed under the order to the responsible party's bill for drainage and wastewater services to the site. If unpaid, the surcharge may become a lien on the property, may be foreclosed, and may accrue interest as provided by state law or Section 21.33.110.

#### 22.808.070 - Public Nuisance

1. Abatement Required. A public nuisance affecting drainage water, drainage, erosion control, grading and other public nuisances set forth in this subsection are violations of this subtitle. A responsible party shall immediately abate a public nuisance upon becoming aware of its existence.
2. Dysfunctional Facility or Practice. Any private drainage control facility or best management practice not installed or maintained as required by this subtitle, or otherwise found to be in a state of dysfunction creating, a threat to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or public or private property is a public nuisance.
3. Obstruction of Watercourse or Public Drainage System. Obstruction of a watercourse or public drainage system without authorization by the Director, and obstruction in such a manner as to increase the risk of flooding or erosion should a storm occur, is a public nuisance.
4. Dangerous Conditions. Any condition relating to grading, drainage water, drainage or erosion which creates a present or imminent danger, or which is likely to create a danger in the event of a storm, to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment, or public or private property is a public nuisance.
5. Abatement by the City. The Director is authorized, but not required, to investigate a condition that the Director suspects of being a public nuisance under this subtitle, and to abate any public nuisance. If a public nuisance is an immediate threat to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment, the Director may summarily and without prior notice abate the condition. The Director shall give notice of the abatement to the responsible party as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement.
6. Collection of Abatement Costs. The costs of abatement may be collected from the responsible party, including a reasonable charge for attorney time and a 15 percent surcharge for administrative expenses as set forth in subsection 22.808.050.D. Abatement costs and other damages, expenses and penalties collected by the City shall go into an abatement account for the department collecting the moneys. The money in the abatement account shall be used for abatements, investigations, and corrections of violations performed by the City. When the account is insufficient the Director may use other available funds.

#### 22.808.080 - Additional Relief

In addition to any remedy provided in this subtitle, the Director may seek any other legal or equitable remedy to enjoin any acts or practice or abate any condition that constitutes or will constitute a violation of this subtitle or a public nuisance.


#### 22.808.090 - Suspension or Revocation

Approvals or permits granted on the basis of inaccurate or misleading information may be suspended or revoked. Other permits or approvals interrelated with an approval suspended or revoked under this subsection, including, but not limited to, certificates of occupancy or approvals for occupancy, may also be suspended or revoked.

#### 22.808.100 - Fees

Fees for drainage control plan review and approvals shall be as identified in Subtitle IX of Title 22. Fees for record-keeping or other activities pursuant to this subtitle shall, unless otherwise provided for in this subtitle, be prescribed by ordinance.


#### 22.808.110 - Financial Assurance and Covenants

As a condition precedent to issuance of any permit or approval provided for in this subtitle, the Director may require an applicant for a permit or approval to submit financial assurances as provided in this subsection.


1. Insurance

    1. The Director may require the property owners or contractor to carry liability and property damage insurance naming the City as an additional insured. The amount, as determined by the Director, shall be commensurate with the risks.
    2. The Director may also require the property owner to maintain a policy of general public liability insurance against personal injury, death, property damage and/or loss from activities conducted pursuant to the permit or approval, or conditions caused by such activities, and naming the City as an additional insured. The amount, as determined by the Director, shall be commensurate with the risks. It shall cover a period of not more than ten years from the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy or finalization of the permit or approval. A certificate evidencing such insurance shall be filed with the Director before issuing a certificate of occupancy or finalizing a permit for any single-family dwelling or duplex.
    3. The insurance policy shall provide that the City will be notified of cancellation of the policy at least 30 days prior to cancellation. The notice shall be sent to the Director who required the insurance and shall state the insured's name and the property address. If a property owner's insurance is canceled and not replaced, the permit or approval and any interrelated permit or approval may be revoked, including a certificate of occupancy or approval for occupancy.
2. Bonds, Cash Deposits or Instruments of Credit

    1. Surety Bond

        1. The Director may require that the property owners or contractor deliver to the Director for filing in the Office of the City Clerk a surety bond, cash deposit or an instrument of credit in such form and amounts deemed by the Director to be necessary to ensure that requirements of the permit or approval are met. A surety bond may be furnished only by a surety company licensed to do business in The State of Washington. The bond shall be conditioned that the work will be completed in accordance with the conditions of the permit or approval, or, if the work is not completed, that the site will be left in a safe condition. The bond shall also be conditioned that the site and nearby, adjacent or surrounding areas will be restored if damaged or made unsafe by activities conducted pursuant to the permit or approval.
        2. The bond will be exonerated one year after a determination by the Director that the requirements of the permit or approval have been met. For work under a building permit, issuance of a certificate of occupancy or approval for occupancy following a final inspection shall be considered to be such a determination.
    2. Assurance in Lieu of Surety Bond. In lieu of a surety bond, the owners may elect to file a cash deposit or instrument of credit with the Director in an amount equal to that which would be required in the surety bond and in a form approved by the Director. The cash deposit or instrument of credit shall comply with the same conditions as required for surety bonds.
3. Covenants

    1. The Director may require a covenant between the property owners and the City. The covenant shall be signed by the owners of the site and notarized prior to issuing any permit or approval in a potential landslide area, potentially hazardous location, flood-prone zone, or other area of potentially hazardous soils or drainage or erosion conditions. The covenant shall not be required where the permit or approval is for work done by the City. The covenant shall include:

        1. A legal description of the property;
        2. A description of the property condition making this subsection applicable;
        3. A statement that the owners of the property understand and accept the responsibility for the risks associated with development on the property given the described condition, and agrees to inform future purchasers and other successors and assignees of the risks;
        4. The application date, type, and number of the permit or approval for which the covenant is required; and
        5. A statement waiving the right of the owners, the owners' heirs, successors and assigns, to assert any claim against the City by reason of or arising out of issuance of the permit or approval by the City for the development on the property, except only for such losses that may directly result from the sole negligence of the City.
    2. The covenant shall be filed by the Director with the King County Recorder's Office, at the expense of the owners, so as to become part of the King County real property records.

#### 22.808.140 - Severability

The provisions of this subtitle are declared to be separate and severable and the invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or portion of this subtitle, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this subtitle or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances.

### Chapter 22.900D - FEES FOR NEW AND ALTERED BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

Sections:

#### 22.900D.010 - Development permit fees

1. General. The development fee shall cover the application, review and inspection process associated with new construction, additions, alterations, and repairs to existing buildings and establishment of use. The development fee shall consist of a permit fee and, where plans are reviewed, a separate plan review fee. The permit fee and plan review fee shall be determined based on valuation, except as provided below.
2. Time of Payment of Fees

    1. Amount Due Prior to Application. Fees for building pre-application conference and any additional fees accrued after the conference shall be due prior to permit application. See subsection 22.900D.010.I for building pre-application conference fees.
    2. Amounts Due at Time of Application. The following amounts are due at the time of application:

        1. Applications for subject-to-field inspection (STFI) permits shall pay a fee equal to the permit fee specified in Table D-2 for 22.900D.010.
        2. Applications for building and/or mechanical permits with plan review shall pay the plan review fees plus ½ the permit fee as specified in Table D-2 for 22.900D.010.
        3. For development permits approved to be issued in phases, the plan review fee plus ½ the permit fee due at the time of application of the first phased submittal shall be calculated based on the value calculated in accordance with Section 22.900D.010.C for the entire scope of the development permit. The remaining portion of the permit fee will not be collected until issuance of the final phase of the development permit that completes the scope of the proposed building project.
        4. For other applications, the minimum fee shall be collected at the time of application.
    3. Fees collected at the time of application will be based on Department estimates of the total fees due at the time of permit issuance. The final Department fees will be recalculated during review, and any additional amount due shall be collected prior to the issuance of the permit, approval, denial, decision or recommendation, provided that hourly fees may be collected earlier, as described in subsection 22.900B.010.D. Any fee in excess of the final calculated fee shall be refunded pursuant to Section 22.900B.050 and subsection 22.900D.010.K.
    4. If, when determining the project value and fees during initial review, the previously collected application fee is determined to be less than 90 percent of the revised application fee, review work after the initial review will not proceed until the balance is paid to the Department.
3. Determination of Value.

    1. The Director shall determine the value of construction for which the permit is issued (the estimated current value of all labor and materials, whether actually paid or not, as well as all finish work, painting, roofing, electrical, plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, elevators, fire-extinguishing systems, automatic sprinkler systems, other mechanical systems, retaining walls, rockeries and any other permanent work or permanent equipment, but not including furnishings). The building valuation data from the International Code Council and other valuation criteria approved by the Director will be used to determine the value of construction.
    2. Dish or Panel Antennae. The fee for processing applications for installation of a dish or panel antenna shall be charged on the value of the foundation and supports constructed for the installation. The value of the dish or panel antenna shall not be included in the determination of value.
    3. The development fee for parks and playgrounds shall be based on the project value, including the value of improvements for structures incidental to the park or playground such as retaining walls, rockeries and restrooms, but shall not include the value of playground equipment.
    4. The valuation shall be based on the highest type of construction to which a proposed structure most nearly conforms, as determined by the Director.
4. Phased Permits

    1. If a new building project is proposed to be built in phases and the Director determines that separate development permits may be issued for approved portions of the project, the development fee for the entire permit shall be based on the value of work according to Table D-2 for 22.900D.010.

        1. If the shoring and/or excavating work is included with the complete foundation (below grade) phase of the building project, the fees for such work shall be included in the fees described above.
        2. If the proposed building project includes a separate shoring and/or excavation phase that is not combined with the complete foundation (below grade) phase, the shoring and/or excavation work will be reviewed and issued as a separate permit. The fees for the excavation portion of that permit shall be based on Section 22.900D.145, and the fees for the shoring portion of that permit shall be based on the value of that structural portion of the work according to Table D-2 for 22.900D.010. No credit will be given for any of these fees toward the phased building permit.
    2. In addition to the fee specified in subsection 22.900D.010.D.1 above, if an applicant requests division of an already-submitted permit application a fee shall be charged for each separate application as specified in Table D-2 for 22.900D.010, and the fee to process this request shall be charged at the SDCI hourly rate.
5. Calculation of Development Fees. The development fee for a permit shall be calculated as described in this Section 22.900D.010.

    1. Table D-1 for 22.900D.010 establishes the Development Fee Index for value-based development fees. Except as specified in Section 22.900D.010.F below, Table D-2 for 22.900D.010 establishes the permit fee and plan review fee, calculated as a percentage of the development fee index where determined by value.
    2. For the calculation of the Development Fee Index, as specified in Table D-1 for 22.900D.010, if a building is more than three stories high using construction Types 1A and 1B, the total building valuation may be modified for structure height depending on the building occupancy as described in the current Director's Rule clarification on "Implementation of the Fee Subtitle, Building Valuation," which is incorporated by reference.
    3. If two or more buildings are allowed under one permit, they shall be assessed fees as separate buildings under Table D-2 for 22.900D.010. The individual fees shall then be added to determine the total development fee for the permit.
6. Blanket Permits

    1. The application fee for a blanket permit to cover initial nonstructural tenant alterations within the first three years of the first tenant alteration permit shall be charged at the rate of $5.10 per 100 square feet of space to be improved within the life of the permit. A deposit based on the estimated value of the work to be completed during the life of the permit shall be collected at the time of application. As individual tenant spaces are reviewed, the amount of the fee equivalent to the floor space examined shall be deducted from the deposit per Table D-2 for 22.900D.010.
    2. The application fee for a blanket permit to cover nonstructural tenant alterations in previously-occupied space, or to cover initial nonstructural tenant alterations after three years of the first tenant alteration permit, is one times the base fee. A deposit based on the estimated value of the proposed work within 18 months shall be collected at the time of application. As individual tenant spaces are reviewed, the fee for the work to be done shall be calculated according to Table D-2 for 22.900D.010 and deducted from the deposit.
    3. If the estimated blanket fee deposit is used up in less time than the life of the permit and work remains to be done, an additional deposit shall be paid based on the estimated floor area remaining to be improved during the remaining life of the permit. If a portion of the deposit is unused at the end of the life of the permit and work remains to be done, credit for the balance of the deposit may be transferred from the expiring permit to a new blanket permit. To minimize additional accounting costs associated with blanket permits, if more than two deposits are made during the life of the blanket permit, the minimum amount of each subsequent deposit shall be $2,000.
7. Revisions to Issued Permits. Fees for revisions to issued permits shall be charged according to standards promulgated by the Director that approximate the additional cost of reviewing the revisions. A nonrefundable fee of one times the base fee shall be paid at the time the revisions are submitted.
8. Certificate of Occupancy. The issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for existing buildings, either if no Certificate of Occupancy has previously been issued or if a change of occupancy is requested, requires a building permit. If there is no construction valuation (there is no work which would require a building permit), the minimum building permit fee shall be assessed. In addition to the minimum building permit fee, if records research, plan examination or inspection is required, charges shall be assessed at the SDCI hourly rate. If work is being done as authorized by a permit, the permanent Certificate of Occupancy fee is not assessed in addition to the building permit fee. The fee for a temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall be charged at the rate of ½ the base fee. The fee for the duplication of a Certificate of Occupancy is $31.80 unless records research, plan examination or inspection is required, in which case charges shall be assessed at the SDCI hourly rate.
9. Building Pre-application Conferences

    1. Required Building Pre-application Conferences. If there is a requirement for a pre-application or pre-design conference, such as buildings subject to the Seattle Building Code special provision for atriums (Section 404), or highrise buildings (Section 403), 35 percent of the estimated plan review fee for the structure shall be charged and paid as specified in subsection 22.900D.010B, and applied toward the development permit fee provided the permit application is made within six months of the date of the pre-application conference. (See Table C-1 for 22.900C.010 for land use pre-application conference fees.)
    2. Other Building Pre-application Conferences. If a pre-application conference is requested by the applicant but is not required by Code, a fee equal to 1.5 times the base fee shall be paid no later than the time of the conference. Such fee is required for each meeting held on a project. In addition to the minimum building pre-application conference fee, if additional staff, research, preliminary plan examination or inspection is required, charges shall be assessed at the SDCI hourly rate and shall be charged and paid as specified in subsection 22.900D.010.B.
10. Correction Fee. After written notice to the applicant, a Correction Fee of $345 will be charged for each additional correction cycle required due to lack of adequate response from the applicant.
11. Renew or Reestablish a Permit

    1. Fees to renew or reestablish a permit shall be charged according to Table D-2 for 22.900D.010. If the fee for a new permit would be less than 1.5 times the base fee, then the fee to renew or reestablish the permit shall be the same as for a new permit.
    2. If changes are made to the original approved plans, an additional fee shall be charged for plans examination and inspections at the SDCI hourly rate.

3. These fees shall not apply to any parking facility that is underground and within a structure or on the roof of a structure, or to any extension of a parking facility that is primarily under a building, provided that the uncovered extension is no more than four feet beyond the footprint of the building. The fees for these parking facilities shall be charged in accordance with Section 22.900D.010.
4. The fee for renewal or reestablishment of a permit for a parking facility is 1.5 times the base fee where there are no changes in the plans. If changes are made to the original plans, an additional fee shall be charged for inspection and/or plan examination at the SDCI hourly rate.

Billing will occur at the time of contract award by the Department of Finance, who will forward the bills to the Department for distribution to appropriate City departments.

Except as specified in subsection 22.900G.080.D, Design Commission fees shall be assessed at a rate of up to 0.3 percent of the construction cost for major City capital improvement projects (greater than $10,000,000 construction budget) for which billing will commence on or before December 31, 1998.

Billing shall occur in accordance with a schedule agreed upon by the City Budget Director and the Design Commission.
3. For City capital improvement projects, as defined in Section 3.58.020, for which no billing commenced under subsections 22.900G.080.A or 22.900G.080.B on or before December 31, 1998, and that do not fall within an exception in subsection 22.900G.080.D, the City Budget Director, the Design Commission, and each affected City department will attempt to agree on that department's projects that are expected to be assessed by the Design Commission in the following year. If no agreement is reached by a date established by the City Budget Director, the City Budget Director will establish the list of such projects. The City Budget Director may establish the assessable appropriation of a City capital improvement below the actual appropriation in order that the project not be assessed an unduly high fee relative to the cost of the anticipated Design Commission review.

    1. The City Budget Director will assess a uniform fee of up to one percent of the total of all departments' capital improvement project appropriations for those projects assessable for Design Commission fees. Such fee shall be set so as to be sufficient, when combined with other funding sources, to support the anticipated costs of the Design Commission for the following year, but in no case shall the fee exceed one percent.

    3. If a capital improvement project's appropriation has been included in a fee assessed under this section, but Design Commission review of that project is delayed into a future year, that appropriation amount shall not be counted again in the calculation of the fee for any future year. If review of a project on which a fee has been assessed under this subsection 22.900G.080.C is canceled, or if review commences on a project that, but for timeliness, would have been included but was not included in the calculation of a fee under this subsection 22.900G.080.C, the City Budget Director shall adjust the department's total assessable appropriation downwards or upwards, respectively, when establishing the subsequent year's fee.
4. Special Exceptions. The Commission will bill non-City projects at the hourly rate of $107 an hour per Commissioner for subcommittee review, or $754 an hour for full Commission review, except that fees may be waived, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the Commission with the concurrence of the City Budget Director in the following circumstances:

    1. Whenever Commission fees, if charged, would be disproportionate to the sums available and could cause abandonment of the project for the following types of projects: art-works, projects funded by grants and donations, neighborhood self-help projects undertaken by volunteers and nonprofit organizations, and small capital improvements;
    2. For low-income and special needs housing projects subject to Design Commission review.
5. Street Use Permit Reviews. Street use permit reviews, which are required before issuance of a street use permit for improvements within the public right-of-way, will be billed at the hourly rate of $107 an hour per Commissioner for subcommittee review, or $754 an hour for full Commission review. Billing will be sent to the Seattle Department of Transportation for inclusion into the plan review costs charged to the applicant, or be billed directly by the Department. For those projects billed through the Seattle Department of Transportation, payment will be made by a fund transfer from the Seattle Transportation Operating Fund to the Department Operating Fund from funds paid by the applicant.
6. Early Master Use Permit Stage or Projects Outside City Contract Process.

    4. The OSE Director shall have the authority by OSE Director's rule to establish grace periods for imposing penalties for any class of structure upon a finding that such grace period will facilitate the submission of energy benchmarking reports and energy performance ratings or otherwise further the purposes of this Chapter 22.930.
2. If a building owner of any building subject to this Chapter 22.930 has been previously issued a notice of violation under this Chapter 22.930 within the past two years, all subsequent violations by that building owner for failing to disclose an energy benchmarking report shall be subject to a $500 fine in addition to any other penalty imposed under this Chapter 22.930.

    1. A $5,000 fine shall be imposed for the first violation; and
    2. A $10,000 fine shall be imposed for the second and any subsequent violations.
4. A subfund shall be established in the City's General Fund to receive revenue from penalties under this Section 22.930.120. Revenue from penalties under this subsection shall be allocated that aim to improve the energy and water efficiency of Seattle buildings. The OSE Director shall recommend to the Mayor and City Council how these funds should be allocated.
5. The penalties in subsection 22.930.120.A shall be imposed by serving a notice of violation that states the specific violation, the amounts of each increase in penalties, and the specific dates that each increase in penalties will accrue. A building owner shall have 30 days from the date of mailing or service of the notice of violation to seek an administrative review of the imposition of the penalties, including each increase in penalties, contained in the notice of violation. The initiation of an administrative review is governed by Section 22.930.140. The failure of a building owner to initiate an appeal within 30 days of the date of mailing or service of the notice of violation shall be a waiver of the right to an administrative review and a waiver of any subsequent appeal or request for mitigation to the Hearing Examiner under Section 22.930.140 or Section 22.930.160 of all penalties contained within the notice of violation.

#### 22.930.130 - Response to notice of violation

1. A building owner shall respond to a notice of violation by:

    1. Paying the amount of the penalty specified in the notice of violation, in which case the record shall show a finding that the person cited committed the violation; or
    2. Requesting in writing an administrative review in accordance with Section 22.930.140 and providing a mailing address to which a benchmarking and reporting program violation challenge form may be sent.
2. A response to a notice of violation shall be received by the Office of Sustainability and Environment within 30 days after the date the notice of violation is mailed or otherwise served. When the last day of the administrative appeal period is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day.

#### 22.930.140 - Administrative review of notice of violation by OSE Director

1. A notice of violation shall be subject to administrative review if the aggrieved party requests in writing a review by the OSE Director within 30 days after service of the notice of violation. When the last day of the review-request period is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day.
2. To be considered by the OSE Director, the written request for review shall be submitted with the Building Tune-Up and Reporting Violation Review Form, which will document the reason for the review.
3. After receiving a request for review, the OSE Director shall notify the requesting party, the building owners who were issued a notice of violation, and any person who requested notice of the review that a request for review has been received.
4. The OSE Director will review the basis for issuing the notice of violation and the Violation Review Form. The OSE Director may request clarification of information received. After the review is completed, the OSE Director may:

    1. Sustain the notice of violation;
    2. Withdraw the notice of violation;
    3. Continue the review to a date certain for receipt of additional information; or
    4. Modify or amend the notice of violation.
5. The OSE Director's administrative review decision is final but is subject to a request for a contested hearing or a mitigation hearing before the Hearing Examiner according to Sections 22.930.160 and 22.930.170.

#### 22.930.150 - Failure to respond to an administrative review decision

If a person fails to respond to an administrative decision within 15 days of service, an order shall be entered by the OSE Director finding that the person cited committed the violation stated in the notice of violation and assessing the penalty specified in the notice of violation.


#### 22.930.160 - Response to an administrative review decision

1. A building owner shall respond to an administrative decision by:

    1. Paying the amount of the penalty specified in the notice of violation, in which case the record shall show a finding that the person cited committed the violation; or
    2. Requesting in writing a mitigation hearing to explain the circumstances surrounding the commission of the violation and providing a mailing address to which notice of such hearing may be sent; or
    3. Requesting in writing a contested hearing and specify the reason why the cited violation did not occur or why the person cited is not responsible for the violation, and providing a mailing address to which notice of such hearing may be sent.
2. A response to an administrative decision shall be received by the Office of the Hearing Examiner no later than 15 days after the date the administrative decision is mailed or served. When the last day of the appeal period is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day.

#### 22.930.170 - Administrative decision mitigation hearings

1. Date and notice. If a building owner requests a mitigation hearing, the mitigation hearing shall be held within 30 days after a written response to the administrative decision requesting a hearing is received by the Hearing Examiner. Notice of the time, place, and date of the hearing will be sent in accordance with Section 3.02.090 not less than ten days prior to the hearing date.
2. Procedure at hearing. The Hearing Examiner shall hold an informal hearing that shall not be governed by the Rules of Evidence. The person cited may present witnesses, but witnesses may not be compelled to attend. A representative from the OSE Director may also be present and may present additional information; however, attendance by a representative from the City of Seattle or the OSE Director is not required.
3. Disposition. The Hearing Examiner shall determine whether the building owner's explanation justifies reduction of the penalty; however, the penalty may not be reduced unless the Director affirms or certifies that the violation has been corrected before the mitigation hearing. Factors that may be considered in whether to reduce the penalty include: whether the violation was caused by the act, neglect, or abuse of another; or whether correction of the violation was commenced promptly before notice of violation but that full compliance was prevented by a condition or circumstance beyond the control of the person cited.

#### 22.930.180 - Contested hearings

1. Date and notice. If a building owner requests a contested hearing, the hearing shall be held within 60 days after the written response to the notice of violation requesting such hearing is received.
2. Hearing. Contested hearings shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures for hearing contested cases contained in Section 3.02.090 and the rules adopted by the Hearing Examiner for hearing contested cases, except as modified by this Section 22.930.180. The issues heard at the hearing shall be limited to those that are raised in writing in the response to the notice of violation and that are within the jurisdiction of the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.
3. Sufficiency. No notice of violation shall be deemed insufficient for failure to contain a detailed statement of the facts constituting the specific violation that the person cited is alleged to have committed or by reason of defects or imperfections, provided such defects or imperfections or lack of detail do not prejudice substantial rights of the person cited.
4. Amendment of notice of violation. A notice of violation may be amended prior to the conclusion of the hearing to conform to the evidence presented if substantial rights of the person cited are not prejudiced.
5. Evidence at hearing

    1. The certified statement or declaration authorized by RCW 9A.72.085 submitted by the Director shall be prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and that the person cited is responsible. The certified statement or declaration of the Director authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 and any other evidence accompanying the report shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation.
    2. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. The person cited may rebut the evidence and establish that the cited violations did not occur or that the person contesting the notice of violation is not responsible for the violation.
6. Disposition. If the notice of violation is sustained at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation. If the violation remains uncorrected, the Hearing Examiner shall impose the applicable penalty. The Hearing Examiner may reduce the monetary penalty in accordance with the mitigation provisions in Section 22.930.160 if the violation has been corrected. If the Hearing Examiner determines that the violation did not occur, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order dismissing the notice of violation.
7. Appeal. The Hearing Examiner's decision is the final decision of the City. Any judicial review shall be commenced by applying for a writ of review in the King County Superior Court within 14 days from the date of the decision in accordance with the procedure set forth in chapter 7.16 RCW, other applicable laws, and court rules.

#### 22.930.190 - Failure to appear for notice of violation hearing

Failure to appear for a requested hearing shall result in an order being entered finding that the person cited committed the violation stated in the notice of violation and assessing the penalty specified in the notice of violation. For good cause shown and upon terms the Hearing Examiner deems just, the Hearing Examiner may set aside an order entered upon a failure to appear.


#### 22.930.200 - Collection of notice of violation penalties

If the person cited fails to pay a penalty imposed pursuant to this Chapter 22.930, the penalty may be referred to a collection agency. The cost to the City for the collection services will be assessed as costs, at the rate agreed to between the City and the collection agency, and added to the penalty. Alternatively, the City may pursue collection in any other manner allowed by law.


#### 22.930.210 - Referral to City Attorney for enforcement

If a person fails to correct a violation or pay a penalty, the OSE Director shall refer the matter to the City Attorney's Office for civil enforcement action. Civil actions to enforce a violation shall be brought exclusively in Municipal Court.


#### 22.930.220 - Appeal to Superior Court

Because civil enforcement actions under this Chapter 22.930 are brought exclusively in Municipal Court, notices of violations are not subject to judicial review under chapter 36.70C RCW. Instead, final decisions of the Municipal Court may be appealed under the Rules for Appeals of Decisions of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction.
