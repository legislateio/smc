    3. The Chairperson and Members will review the proposed Opinion-gathering Activities and may request from the Department additional information about each proposed Opinion-gathering Activity until the Chairperson, in consultation with the Members, determines that s/he should approve or reject each Opinion-gathering Activity and its associated range of estimated Costs set forth in the matrix. During the initial approval stage, a Department will provide a Committee briefing on a proposed Opinion-gathering Activity only at the request of the Chairperson or a Member.
    4. After the Chairperson communicates approval of an Opinion-gathering Activity, the Department may proceed to expend appropriated funds to develop or have developed the instrument or questions needed to undertake the Opinion-gathering Activity, but may not expend appropriated funds to administer the instrument or questions except as in described in subsection B of this section.
    5.

    2. The Chairperson and Members may request and suggest changes to the instrument or questions.
    3. If the Chairperson gives final approval of the instrument or questions, the Department may spend or encumber appropriated funds up to the maximum Cost estimated in the matrix and may administer the Opinion-gathering Activity as described to the Chairperson and Members.
    4. If the Chairperson rejects the instruments or questions, the Department shall not spend or encumber appropriated funds on the Opinion-gathering Activity.
    5. A Department shall not spend or encumber appropriated funds for expenses in excess of the maximum Cost estimated in the matrix for an Opinion-gathering Activity unless the Department has first provided the Chairperson and Members with a justification for the excess expenditures and the Chairperson has approved the excess Cost.
3. Reporting of Results.

    1. The Department shall transmit to the Chairperson and Members the Cost and a written copy of the Results of each Opinion-gathering Activity, within 30 days of preparing or receiving the final Results.

4. Exceptions.

    1. A Department may undertake an Opinion-gathering Activity with a Cost below $2500 without obtaining the approvals required in subsections A and B of this section. Departments are encouraged to include Opinion-gathering Activities with a Cost below $2500 in the matrices they submit to the relevant Committee, even though Committee approval of such Opinion-gathering Activities is not required.

At the conclusion of any Opinion-gathering Activity undertaken pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, the Department must notify the Chairperson and Members in writing of the Cost and Results of each such Opinion-gathering Activity, and, if the Opinion-gathering Activity was never included in a matrix, describe its nature and scope. Opinion-gathering Activities that do not involve the expenditure of appropriated funds are exempt from the provisions of this subsection 2.
5. Changes to Approved Opinion-gathering Activities.

    1. A Department shall not change the scope, purpose, target audience, range of estimated costs, or other aspect of an Opinion-gathering Activity for which the Chairperson has communicated initial approval pursuant to Section 5.09.030(A) of this chapter without first receiving the Chairperson's approval of such change.
    2. Once an Opinion-gathering Activity has received final approval from the Chairperson pursuant to Section 5.09.030(B) of this chapter, a Department shall not change the substance of the instrument or add, remove, or modify questions without first receiving the Chairperson's approval of such change, addition, removal, or modification.

#### 5.09.040 - Opinion-gathering required by ordinance, contract, collective bargaining agreement, or law.

Even though opinion-gathering activities required by ordinance, or by a contract or collective bargaining agreement approved by City ordinance, or otherwise required by law, are excluded from the definition of Opinion-gathering Activity pursuant to Section 5.09.020(I)(6) and are therefore not subject to the approval requirements of this chapter, no Department may spend or encumber appropriated funds on opinion-gathering activities that fall within Section 5.09.020(I)(6) without transmitting to the Chairperson and Members a written copy of the findings, results, data, analysis, report or other product of such opinion-gathering activity within 30 days of preparing or receiving them, along with a statement of the costs of the activity.


#### 5.09.050 - Noncompliance.

A Chairperson may report any instances of noncompliance with this chapter to the Council President and to the Chairperson of the Finance and Budget Committee. Any such instances may be taken into consideration as part of the Council budget process.

1. The admission tax as imposed in Section 5.40.020 shall not apply to any person paying an admission charge to any premises or location for which the Director has issued a certificate of exemption pursuant to this Section 5.40.028; however, the admission tax shall be due for any and all admission charges paid prior to the issuance of a certificate of exemption, or paid after the Director has cancelled a certificate of exemption, or paid at any time during which a cancellation of a certificate of exemption could or should have been in effect under any one or more of subsections 5.40.028.G.1 through 5.40.020.G.6.

For purposes of this Section 5.40.028 a premises or location has obtained a violation if there is a legally binding final decision, order, citation, or other finding of violation entered by any court, adjudicative body, or government agency against any legal owner, operator, manager, or employee of the premises or location, or any other person hosting or presenting live music at the premises or location.
4.

Anyone who is admitted at a reduced price to any place or for any event for which other persons pay a regular, higher admission charge shall pay an admission tax measured by the regular, higher admission charge, unless:


1. The reduced charge is based on the quantity sold or a payment made before a calendar date in advance of the event; or
2. The reduced charge is available to a general classification of the public identified in rates posted or published for the event (e.g., children, senior citizens, or military personnel); or
3. The event is scheduled at a time less convenient for the public (e.g., a matinee or midnight performance); or

In cases that satisfy one (1) or more of these conditions, the admission tax shall be measured based on the reduced charge actually paid for admission.


#### 5.40.060 - Ticket information and unlawful acts

For transactions between the promoter, sponsor, or venue and the original purchaser or customer, the admission tax due shall be based on the total sum of the established price plus any service charge printed on the ticket.

Established Price

Service Charge (if any)

1. Whenever a charge is made for admission to any place, a serially numbered or reserve seat ticket shall be furnished to the person paying such charge unless written approval has been obtained from the Director to use: (1) a turnstile or other counting device which will accurately count the number of paid admissions, or (2) any method established by administrative rule that determines the number of paid admissions for the purposes of this chapter. The established price, service charge, sales tax, City admission tax and total price at which every admission ticket is sold shall be separately, conspicuously and indelibly printed or written on the face or back of that part of the ticket which is to be collected by the management of the place to which admission is gained.

Ticket sales that occur through a subsequent sale(s) of the ticket(s) by the initial purchaser who purchased the ticket(s) from the promoter, sponsor, or venue, or any subsequent sale of such ticket(s), may be made at market price. No admission tax will be assessed by the City on the price of an admission ticket in a secondary market transaction, conducted by the initial purchaser or a subsequent purchaser thereof. However, vendors and other persons regularly engaged in the business of reselling tickets or admissions into events must obtain a business license tax certificate pursuant to Section 5.55.030.
3. The Director or his/her designee, who has been commissioned as a Special Police Officer, or the Seattle Police Chief or his/her designee, is authorized to confiscate, seize or otherwise remove from sale, or offered sale, any ticket in violation of or offered for sale or sold in violation of this subsection.

The tax collected under this chapter shall be deemed held in trust by the person required to collect the same until remitted to the Director. Persons failing to collect the admission tax, or who collects the tax but fails to remit the tax to the Director shall be liable to the City for the amount of such tax. Such person shall, unless the remittance be made as required in this section, be guilty of a violation of this chapter whether such failure be the result of his or its own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his or its control. Anyone receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon such forms and setting forth such information as the Director may require, showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he is liable for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and transmit the same to the Director with a remittance for said amount. Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or amusement makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax levied in this chapter, and the same is of a temporary or transitory nature or there exists a reasonable question of financial responsibility, of which the Director shall be the judge, the Director may require the report and remittance of the admission tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at the conclusion of the performance or exhibition, or at the conclusion of the series of performances or exhibitions or at such other times as he or she shall determine. Failure to comply with any requirement of the Director as to report and remittance of the tax as required shall be a violation of this chapter. Everyone liable for the collection and payment of the tax imposed by this chapter shall keep and preserve for a period of five (5) years all unused tickets, ticket manifests, books and all other records from which can be determined the amount of admission tax which he or she was liable to remit under the provisions of this chapter, and all such tickets, books and records shall be open for examination and audit at all reasonable times by the Director or his or her duly authorized agent. Written permission may be granted by the Director to destroy unused tickets prior to the expiration of the five (5) year period.

The application shall be filed whether or not the person has received an exemption from collecting the tax under the provision of this chapter. The Director shall then issue a business license tax certificate with an admission tax endorsement. The endorsement shall be valid for as long as the person maintains a valid business license tax certificate. Failure of any person to obtain the endorsement for conducting any activity for which an admission charge is made within twenty days after the Director notifies the person of the requirement will result in a penalty of $250. This penalty is in addition to any tax and penalties due according to subsection 5.55.110.A, if applicable.


#### 5.40.085 - Certificate of exemption—Application, issuance—Cancellation—Proof of nonprofit status

Any person seeking to secure an exemption pursuant to Section 5.40.025 from the admission tax as provided in this Chapter 5.40 shall present, at the time of its application for a business license tax certificate as described in Section 5.55.030, official proof of its exemption from federal income taxation pursuant to Section 501(c)(3), (4) or (6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as now existing or hereafter amended, or in the alternative provide proof of its specific exemption from the requirement to file IRS Form 1023 in order to obtain tax exempt status. If the exemption applicant already has a business license tax certificate, then the request for exemption and proof required above shall be filed prior to engaging in the activity that requires an admission. If the Director determines that persons paying such admission charge are not subject to the admission tax, the applicant shall receive a certification of such determination for the activity or series of activities, as the case may be. The Director shall issue a person a certificate of exemption that applies retroactively if the person presents proof of eligibility for a certificate of exemption under this Section 5.40.085 for the entire period of retroactive certification and also remits to the City any admission tax collected under subsection 5.40.020.H but not yet remitted. The City shall not refund any admission tax already remitted to the City by the person prior to the issue of the certificate of exemption.
2. The Director may cancel the certificate of exemption of any college, university, or nonprofit organization that (1) secures an exemption from the tax by making a false representation in its application, or (2) otherwise violates Section 5.40.025 or a rule or regulation of the Director implementing it.
3. If the Director has ordered a certificate of exemption cancelled, an aggrieved person may contest the cancellation by filing a notice of appeal and request for hearing with the Hearing Examiner within 30 days after service or mailing of the order. If a request for hearing is filed by the applicant within the prescribed period, a hearing shall be scheduled before the Hearing Examiner and shall be conducted by the Hearing Examiner according to the applicable Hearing Examiner rules.
4. A certificate of exemption issued under subsection 5.40.085.A will be valid for as long as the person receiving the certificate holds a business license tax certificate under Section 5.55.030 and remains eligible to obtain a certificate under subsection 5.40.085.A.

#### 5.40.086 - Elimination of exemptions.

If any exemption from the admission tax is found to be unconstitutional because a court determines it wrongly exempts some events or entities but not others, then that exemption shall be eliminated in its entirety effective on the date of the court decision.


#### 5.40.090 - Certificate of registration—Transitory events—Owner/lessee and promoter/conductor jointly and severally liable.

Whenever the applicant for a certificate of registration is not the owner, lessee, or custodian of the premises or location to which an admission fee is required to be paid, the owner, lessee or custodian of the premises or location shall be jointly and severally liable for the reporting and remittance of the admission tax. The applicant for a certificate of registration in any such case shall furnish the Director with the application, containing the name and address of the owner, lessee or custodian of the premises or location to which an admission fee is required to be paid, and such owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Director of the issuance of such certificate and of his joint and several liability for collection and remittance of the tax.

#### 5.45.040 - Agency—Sales and services by agent, consignee, bailee, factor or auctioneer.

The burden shall be upon the taxpayer in every case to establish the fact that such taxpayer is not engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property but is acting merely as broker or agent in promoting sales or making purchases for a principal. Such claim will be recognized only when the contract or agreement between such persons clearly establishes the relationship of principal and agent and when the following conditions are complied with:


1. The books and records of the broker or agent show the transactions were made in the name and for the account of the principal, and show the name of the actual owner of the property for whom the sale was made, or the actual buyer for whom the purchase was made;

1. The books and records of the agent show that the services were obtained in the name and for the account of the principal, and show the actual principal for whom the purchase was made; and

Commissions must be computed according to a set percentage or amount, which is agreed upon in the agency agreement.

1. Sales in Own Name—Sales or Purchases as Agent. Every person, including agents, consignees, bailees, factors or auctioneers, having either actual or constructive possession of tangible personal property or having possession of the documents of title thereto, with power to sell such tangible personal property in his or her or its own name and actually so selling shall be deemed the seller of such tangible personal property within the meaning of this chapter.
2. If the requirements in subsection A above are not met, the consignor, bailor, principal or other shall be deemed a seller of such property to the agent, consignee, bailee, factor or auctioneer.

#### 5.45.080 - Persons conducting business both within and without the City

This section instructs taxpayers which revenues will be assigned to the City as taxable for periods prior to January 1, 2008. Once the amount subject to tax in Seattle is determined according to this section, then the credit or deductions contained in 5.45.070 and 5.45.075 may be calculated, if applicable.

Allocations of amounts under this Section shall be made in accordance with and in full compliance with the provisions of the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution where applicable.


1. A person who maintains an office or place of business in the City shall be taxable on the gross income, gross proceeds of sales, or value of products derived from the business activities rendered by, generated from, or attributable to the office or place of business located within the City, unless specific deductions or exemptions apply.
2. A person engaging in business activities in the City who does not maintain an office or place of business in the City shall allocate to the City that portion of the taxpayer's gross income or gross proceeds of sales that are derived from business activities performed in the City.
3. A person who maintains an office or place of business in the City and also elsewhere:

    1. Shall be taxable on that portion of his gross income or gross proceeds of sales, or value of products that is derived from business activity rendered by, generated from, or attributable to the office or place of business located within the City, unless specific deductions or exemptions apply; and
    2. Shall allocate to the City and be taxable on gross income, or gross proceeds of sales, from business activities performed in the City but supported by the office or place of business located outside the City, where the business activity performed in the City is a significant factor in making or holding the market for the goods or services sold, and

        1. Delivery of product or the performance of services occurs in Seattle; or

4. If the Director determines that the allocation of gross income from business activities for a person subject to subsection C above and taxable under the "other business activities" classification subsection 5.45.050.G does not fairly reflect gross income derived from business activities within the City, the Director shall determine such gross income by either of the following methods: (a) by a fair and equitable formula agreed upon by the Director and the taxpayer after a consideration of the facts; or (b) by the ratio that the cost of doing business within the City bears to the cost of doing business both within and without the City. For apportionment purposes, all costs must be assigned to an office location.
5. This section does not apply to allocate gross income of motor carriers included in the measure of the tax pursuant to subsection 5.45.050 E of the Seattle Municipal Code. This section may apply to allocate gross receipts of motor carriers included in the measure of the tax pursuant to any other subsection of Section 5.45.050.

#### 5.45.081 - Assignment of revenues

Beginning on January 1, 2008, and with the exception of those persons subject to the provisions of chapter 82.14A RCW, this section will be used to assign revenue for purposes of the business license tax imposed under Section 5.45.050.


1. Gross income derived from all activities other than those taxed under subsections 5.45.050.E, 5.45.050.F, and 5.45.050.G shall be assigned to the location where the activity takes place.
2. For sales of tangible personal property, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs.
3. In the case of sales of digital products, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs. The delivery of digital products will be deemed to occur at:

    1. The seller's place of business if the purchaser receives the digital product at the seller's place of business;
    2. If not received at the seller's place of business, the location where the purchaser or the purchaser's donee, designated as such by the purchaser, receives the digital product, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller;
    3. If the location where the purchaser or the purchaser's donee receives the digital product is not known, the purchaser's address maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith;
    4. If no address for the purchaser is maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business, the purchaser's address obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; and
    5. If no address for the purchaser is obtained during the consummation of the sale, the address where the digital good or digital code is first made available for transmission by the seller or the address from which the digital automated service or service described in RCW 82.04.050 (2)(g) or (6)(b) was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold.
4. If none of the methods in subsection 5.45.081.C for determining where the delivery of digital products occurs are available after a good faith effort by the taxpayer to apply the methods provided in subsections 5.45.081.C.1 through 5.45.081.C.5, then the city and the taxpayer may mutually agree to employ any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products. The taxpayer will be responsible for petitioning the city to use an alternative method under this subsection 5.45.081.D. The city may employ an alternative method for allocating the income from the sale of digital products if the methods provided in subsections 5.45.081.C.1 through 5.45.081.C.5 are not available and the taxpayer and the city are unable to mutually agree on an alternative method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products.
5. For purposes of subsections 5.45.081.C.1 through 5.45.081.C.5, "Receive" has the same meaning as in RCW 82.32.730.
6. Gross income derived from international investment management services taxed under subsection 5.45.050.F and from service and other business activity taxed under subsection 5.45.050.G shall be apportioned to the City by multiplying apportionable income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor plus the service and other business activity income factor and the denominator of which is two.

    1. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid for compensation in the city during the tax period by the taxpayer and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid in the city if:

        1. The individual or employee is primarily assigned within the city;
        2. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period and the employee performs fifty percent (50%) or more of his or her service for the tax period in the city; or
        3. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period, the individual does not perform fifty percent (50%) or more of his or her service in any city, and the employee resides in the city.
    2. The service and other business activity income factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total service and other business activity income of the taxpayer in the city during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total service and other business activity income of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Service and other business activity income is in the city if:

        1. The customer location is in the city; or
        2. The income-producing activity is performed in more than one (1) location and a greater proportion of the service-income-producing activity is performed in the city than in any other location, based on costs of performance, and the taxpayer is not taxable at the customer location; or
        3. The service and other business activity income producing activity is performed within the city, and the taxpayer is not taxable in the customer location.
    3. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in the city or cities in which the taxpayer does business, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrators may jointly require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, that one of the following methods be used jointly by the cities to allocate or apportion gross income, if reasonable:

        1. Separate accounting;
        2. The use of a single factor;
        3. The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer's business activity in the city; or
        4. The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.
7. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.

    1. "Apportionable income" means the gross income of the business taxable under the service and other business activity classification, including income received from activities outside the city if the income would be taxable under the service and other business activity classification if received from activities within the city, less any exemptions or deductions available.
    2. "Compensation" means wages, salaries, commissions, and any other form of remuneration paid to individuals for personal services that are or would be included in the individual's gross income under the federal Internal Revenue Code.

    4. "Customer location" means the city or unincorporated area of a county where the majority of the contacts between the taxpayer and the customer take place.
    5. "Primarily assigned" means the business location of the taxpayer where the individual performs his or her duties.
    6. "Service-taxable income" or "service income" means gross income of the business subject to tax under the service and other business activity classification, including but not limited to royalty income.
    7. "Tax period" means the calendar year during which tax liability is accrued. If taxes are reported by a taxpayer on a basis more frequent than once per year, taxpayers shall calculate the factors for the previous calendar year for reporting in the current calendar year and correct the reporting for the previous year when the factors are calculated for that year, but not later than the end of the first quarter of the following year.
    8. "Taxable in the customer location" means either that a taxpayer is subject to a gross receipts tax in the customer location for the privilege of doing business, or that the government where the customer is located has the authority to subject the taxpayer to gross receipts tax regardless of whether, in fact, the government does so.
8. Assignment or apportionment of revenue under this section shall be made in accordance with and in full compliance with the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution where applicable.
9. This section does not apply to allocate gross income of motor carriers included in the measure of the tax pursuant to subsection 5.45.050.E of the Seattle Municipal Code.

2. Freight brokers should report revenue from brokering activities under the "other business activity" classification (Subsection 5.45.050.G).

### Chapter 5.46 - SQUARE FOOTAGE TAX

Sections:

#### 5.46.010 - Administrative Provisions.

All of the provisions contained in Chapter 5.55 of the Seattle Municipal Code shall have full force and application with respect to taxes imposed under the provisions of this chapter except as may be expressly stated to the contrary herein.


#### 5.46.020 - Definitions.

The definitions contained in Chapter 5.30 of the Seattle Municipal Code shall be fully applicable to this chapter except as may be expressly stated to the contrary herein. The following additional definitions shall apply throughout this Chapter:


1. "Business floor space" means rentable square feet of an office or place of business and includes the proportionate share of the building service areas such as lobbies, corridors and other common areas in a building. The rentable square footage shall be computed by measuring to the inside finish of permanent outer building walls and shall include space used by columns and projections necessary to the building. Business floor space does not include vertical penetrations through the building such as stairs, elevators, or heating, ventilation, air conditioning, utility, or telephone systems. Business floor space does not include other floor space as defined in subsection B below. If the business floor space is owned by the taxpayer, the business floor space will be calculated in the same manner as above and as if the area was rented.
2. "Other floor space" means rentable square feet used for dining areas, exercise areas, or warehouse space.

    1. "Dining area" means any space used exclusively by employees for the purpose of purchasing, preparing, or consuming meals.
    2. "Exercise area" means any space used exclusively by employees for the purpose of physical exercise not related to an employee's normal job duties.
    3. "Warehouse space" means any space used exclusively for the storage of merchandise or commodities.
Other floor space will be measured in the same manner as business floor space whether owned or rented.


#### 5.46.030 - Tax Imposed—Measure of the Tax

The tax shall be measured by the number of square feet of business floor space and other floor space for each office or place of business leased, owned, occupied or otherwise maintained within the city during the reporting period.

No person shall owe square footage business tax for engaging in business activities within the city after December 31, 2015 and this Chapter 5.46 shall be limited to determining and collecting the square footage business tax due for persons engaging in business activities within the city prior to December 31, 2015.

When the change in income calculated in subsection 3(b) is a negative number, the amount so calculated shall reduce the amount calculated in subsection 3(a); however, if the sum of the totals calculated under subsections 3(a) and 3(b) is a negative number, then the adjusted gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) shall be equal to the total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s).


1. In computing the tax credit, any gross receipts from manufacturing, extracting, and printing, and also subject to a selling tax (such as retailing and wholesaling) according to the Multiple Activity Tax Credit (Section 5.45.070), shall be included in the gross income and the adjusted gross income only once.

1. For all periods from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2015, a square footage business tax for the act or privilege of engaging in business activities within the city is hereby levied upon and shall be collected from every person that leases, owns, occupies or otherwise maintains an office or place of business within the city.
2. The amount of the tax due shall be equal to the sum of the number of square feet of business floor space for each office or place of business leased, owned, occupied or otherwise maintained within the city multiplied by the rate of $0.39 quarterly ($1.56 annually), and the number of square feet of other floor space for each office or place of business leased, owned, occupied or otherwise maintained within the city multiplied by the rate of $0.13 quarterly ($0.52 annually). The Director will adjust the square footage business tax rate annually for inflation as follows: the tax rate for a year will be equal to the tax rate for the previous year increased (or decreased) by the percentage change in the annual Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton, WA consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) for the previous year.
3. Persons with more than one office or place of business must include all business floor space and other floor space for all locations. When a person rents space to another person, the person occupying the rental space is responsible for the square footage business tax on that rental space only if the renter has exclusive right of possession in the space as against the landlord. Space rented for the storage of goods in a warehouse where no walls separate the goods, and where the exclusive right of possession in the space is not held by the person to whom the space is rented, shall be included in the other floor space of the person that operates the warehouse business, and not by the business renting the warehouse space.
4. Persons whose business floor space, other floor space, or period of occupancy changes during a reporting period shall prorate the business floor space or other floor space for the reporting period. A change in the period of occupancy during the reporting period shall be prorated using a ratio of the number of days of occupancy during the reporting period compared to the total number of days within the reporting period. If the amount of business floor space or other floor space changes during the reporting period, floor space for the period shall be computed as a weighted average of the rentable space occupied during different segments of the reporting period. Weighting will be based upon the percentage of the reporting period that a given amount of space was leased, owned, occupied, or otherwise maintained within the city.
5. Any person required to pay the square footage business tax imposed in this chapter that also pays the business license tax as imposed in Section 5.45.050 may take a credit against the square footage business tax computed as follows:

    1. The credit is equal to the square footage business tax owed for the reporting period multiplied by the ratio of adjusted gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) for the reporting period to the total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) for the reporting period.
    2. For the purpose of this section, "total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s)" is equal to the total gross income derived from the business activities rendered by, generated from, or attributable to the place(s) of business located within the city.
    3. For the purpose of this section, "adjusted gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s)" shall include total gross income derived from the Seattle business location(s) less:

        1. income derived from the sales of tangible personal property and retail services by the Seattle business location(s) delivered to a location within the State of Washington where no local jurisdiction imposes an eligible gross receipts tax; and
        2. the gross income of the Seattle business location(s) subject to the business license tax under subsection 5.45.050.G as determined by Section 5.45.060 through Section 5.45.080 less the gross income of the Seattle business location(s) subject to the business license tax under subsection 5.45.050.G as determined by Section 5.45.060 through Section 5.45.076 and Section 5.45.081.

#### 5.48.060 - City of Seattle subject to tax.

#### 5.48.070 - Exceptions and deductions.

1. There shall be excepted and deducted from the total gross income upon which the license fee or tax is computed, amounts derived from business which the City is prohibited from taxing under the Constitution or laws of the United States, the Constitution or laws of the state, or the Charter of the City; and any amounts collected by the taxpayer as an excise tax (trust funds) and remitted to the taxing authority, including but not limited to the leasehold excise tax, retail sales and use tax, State's refuse collection tax and admission tax.
2. A taxpayer engaged in a telephone business shall exclude from the total taxable gross income taxed under this chapter charges to another telecommunications company, for such fees and charges as are excluded under SMC Section 5.48.050 A. This excluded revenue shall be recorded and taxed under SMC Chapter 5.45.
3. A deduction from gross income shall be allowed, only to cellular telephone service companies who keep their regular books of account on an accrual basis, for credit losses actually sustained by a taxpayer as a result of cellular telephone service business.

#### 5.48.260 - Allocation of revenues—Cellular telephone service.

1. In determining the total gross income from telephone business in the City for purposes of Section 5.48.050 A, there shall be included all gross income from cellular telephone service (including roaming charges incurred by Seattle customers outside this state) provided to customers whose "place of primary use" is in the City, regardless of the location of the facilities used to provide the service. The customer's "place of primary use" is, with respect to each telephone: (a) the customer's address; or (b) the customer's place of residence if the telephone is for personal use, and in both cases must be located within the licensed service area of the home service provider. Roaming charges and cellular telephone charges to customer whose principal service address is outside Seattle will not be taxable even though those mobile services are provided within Seattle.
2. There is a rebuttable presumption that the "place of primary use" address shown on the cellular telephone service company's records is accurate. If the cellular telephone service company knows or should have known that a customer's place of primary use address for a telephone is within the City then the gross revenue from cellular telephone service provided to that customer with respect to that telephone is to be included in the company's gross income.

Such right of first refusal shall be included within the contract with the City required under Section 5.72.060 A of this chapter.

For new construction, if at any time during the 18 months prior to the date of submission of an application for exemption under this Chapter 5.73, a building containing four or more Dwelling Units exists on the site and any of such units is occupied by a tenant or tenants receiving or eligible to receive a tenant relocation assistance payment under Chapter 22.210, and such building has been or will be demolished, then the Owner shall agree, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Director, to replace all units that were occupied by a tenant or tenants receiving or eligible to receive a tenant relocation assistance payment under Chapter 22.210, subject to the following requirements:

        1. For the duration of the tax exemption, the replacement units shall be affordable at or below 50 percent of median income as adjusted for household size according to the method used by HUD for income limits in subsidized housing and according to HUD rules for the HOME program for presumed family size based on the number of bedrooms in a unit.
        2. Replacement may be accomplished either as part of the new construction for which application for exemption is made under this Chapter 5.73, or through the new construction of additional multifamily housing at another location, or through the substantial rehabilitation of vacant multifamily housing, or through the preservation of multifamily housing that is rented at the time of application to tenants with household annual income at or below 50 percent of Median Income as adjusted for household size according to the method used by HUD for income limits in subsidized housing and according to HUD rules for the HOME program for presumed family size based on the number of bedrooms in a unit, and that the Director determines would otherwise be converted to a use other than rental to tenants with such income.
        3. The replacement housing shall be completed, and a temporary or permanent certificate of occupancy shall be issued, within three years from the date of approval of the application as described in Section 5.73.060, provided that the Director may extend the time for completion if the Director finds that:

            1. The failure to complete the replacement housing is due to circumstances beyond the Owner's control;
            2. The Owner has been acting and may reasonably be expected to continue to act in good faith and with due diligence; and
            3. The replacement housing will be completed within a reasonable time.
        4. Where the existing rental housing building was demolished before the effective date of this Chapter 5.73, the requirements of this subsection 5.73.040.A do not apply.
    8. The Owner shall obtain a certificate of approval, permit, or other approval under Chapter 25.12, Landmarks Preservation Ordinance, Chapter 23.66, Special Review Districts, or those provisions of Chapter 25.16, Chapter 25.20, Chapter 25.22, Chapter 25.24, or Chapter 25.28, relating to Landmark or Historical Districts, if such certificate of approval, permit, or other approval is required under those chapters.
    9. The Multifamily Housing must comply with all applicable zoning requirements, land use regulations, and building and housing code requirements contained or incorporated in Titles 22, 23, and 25.
    10. For the duration of the exemption granted under this Chapter 5.73, the Multifamily Housing and the property on which it is located shall have no violations of applicable zoning requirements, land use regulations, and building and housing code requirements contained or incorporated in Titles 22, 23, and 25 for which the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections has issued a notice of violation that is not resolved by a certificate of compliance, certificate of release, or withdrawal within the time period for compliance provided in such notice of violation and any extension of the time period for compliance granted by the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections.
    11. The Multifamily Housing must be scheduled to be completed within three years from the date of approval of the application.
2. In addition to the requirements in subsection 5.73.040.A, rental projects must comply with the following affordability requirements from the date of application for the Final Certificate of Tax Exemption ("Final Certificate") for the duration of the exemption period:

    1. In projects that contain at least the minimum number of Dwelling Units with two or more bedrooms, according to Table A for 5.73.040.B, a minimum of 20 percent of all units in the Project shall be Affordable Units rented to tenants whose household annual income is at or below 40 percent of Median Income for housing units in Congregate Residences or small efficiency Dwelling Units, at or below 65 percent of Median Income for studio units, at or below 75 percent of Median Income for one-bedroom units, at or below 85 percent of Median Income for two-bedroom units, and at or below 90 percent of Median Income for three-bedroom and larger units.
    2. In projects containing fewer Dwelling Units with two or more bedrooms than is indicated in Table A for 5.73.040.B, a minimum of 25 percent of all units shall be Affordable Units rented to tenants whose House Annual Income is at or below 40 percent of Median Income for housing units in Congregate Residences or small efficiency dwelling units, at or below 65 percent of Median Income for studio units, at or below 75 percent of Median Income for one-bedroom units, at or below 85 percent of Median Income for two-bedroom units, and at or below 90 percent of Median Income for three-bedroom and larger units.
    3. If, in calculating the total number of Affordable Units, the number contains a fraction, then the number of Affordable Units shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
    4. The mix and configuration of Affordable Units (e.g., housing units in Congregate Residences, small efficiency dwelling units, studios, one-bedrooms, two-bedrooms, three-bedrooms, etc.) shall be substantially proportional to the mix and configuration of the total housing units in the Project; provided that all units with three or more bedrooms may be combined into a single category for the purpose of compliance with this provision. When the Project contains more than one building, all of the Affordable Units required by this subsection 5.73.040.B may not be located in the same building.
3. In addition to the requirements in subsection 5.73.040.A, units eligible for tax exemption in owner-occupied Multifamily Housing must comply with the following:

Units must be sold at a sales price as established by the Director and adjusted periodically to buyers with Household Annual Income at the time of purchase at or below 100 percent of Median Income for studio and one-bedroom units, and at or below 120 percent of Median Income for two-bedroom or larger units.
    2. The contract with the City required under Section 5.73.060 of this Chapter 5.73 shall identify those units that are designated to meet the affordability requirements of this subsection 5.73.040.C.
4. Upfront tenant fees

    1. The Director is authorized to limit fees charged to Income Eligible Occupants upon move-in or transfer in the same building, including, but not limited to, property administrative fees, transfer fees, last month's rent, and security deposits. Any limitations placed on fees shall not include criminal background or credit checks, which may be charged to the Income Eligible Occupant at cost.
    2. Owners shall not authorize a fee to be charged to Income Eligible Occupants for income verification or program administration of the Multifamily Tax Exemption Program.

#### 5.73.050 - Application procedure—Fee

    1. A brief written description of the units, and schematic site plans, floor plans, and unit layouts of the Multifamily Housing units and the structure(s) in which they are proposed to be located; every unit layout must include detailed information that adequately demonstrates the number of Bedrooms, consistent with subsection 5.73.020;
    2. A statement from the Owner acknowledging the potential tax liability when the Multifamily Housing ceases to be eligible for exemption under this Chapter 5.73;

    6. A recent title report confirming the legal description and ownership of the property where the Multifamily Housing is or will be located; evidence satisfactory to the Director concerning the type of Owner entity or entities and organizational structure; a sample signature block for the Owner(s); and evidence satisfactory to the Director of authority of the person or persons signing the application.
2. At the time of application under this Section 5.73.050, the Owner shall pay to the City an initial application fee of $10,000 if fewer than 75 percent of the total units in a project for which a tax exemption is sought under this Chapter 5.73 are Affordable Units, or $4,500 if at least 75 percent of the total units in a project for which a tax exemption is sought under this Chapter 5.73 are Affordable Units. The Director shall have authority to increase the application fee by up to five percent each calendar year unless revised by ordinance.
3. The Director shall notify the Owner within 28 days of the application being filed if the Director determines that an application is not complete and shall identify what additional information is required before the application will be complete. Within 28 days of receiving additional information, the Director shall notify the Owner in writing if the Director determines that the application is still not complete, and what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the Director does not notify the Owner in writing by the deadlines in this Section 5.73.050 that the application is incomplete; however, a determination of completeness does not preclude the Director from requiring additional information during the review process if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the criteria in this Chapter 5.73.
4. The deadline for application shall be any time before, but no later than, the date the first building permit under Title 22 is issued.

#### 5.73.060 - Application review—Issuance of conditional certificate—Denial—Appeal—Recording of contract

The Director is authorized to cause to be recorded, or require the Owner to record, in the real property records of the King County Recorder's Office, the contract or such other document(s) as will identify such terms and conditions of eligibility for exemption under this Chapter 5.73 as the Director deems appropriate for recording, including the affordability requirements under this Chapter 5.73.
4. Following execution of the contract by the Owner and the City, the Director shall issue a Conditional Certificate of Acceptance of Tax Exemption ("Conditional Certificate"). The Conditional Certificate shall expire three years from the date of approval unless an extension is granted as provided in this Chapter 5.73.
5. If the application is denied, the Director shall state in writing the reasons for the denial and send notice of denial to the Owner's last known address within ten days of the denial.
6. An Owner may appeal the Director's denial of the application by filing an appeal to the City Council with the City Clerk within 30 days of receipt of the denial.

The City Council's decision on appeal is final.

The Owner shall submit to the Director a written request stating the grounds for the extension together with a fee of $200 for the City's administrative cost to process the request. The Director may grant an extension if the Director determines that:


1. The anticipated failure to complete new construction or Rehabilitation Improvements within the required time period is due to circumstances beyond the control of the Owner; and
2. The Owner has been acting and could reasonably be expected to continue to act in good faith and with due diligence; and
3. All the conditions of the original contract between the Owner and the City will be satisfied upon completion of the Project.

#### 5.73.080 - Final Certificate—Application—Issuance—Denial and appeal

1. Upon completion of the rehabilitation improvements or new construction as provided in the contract between the Owner and the City, and upon issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy, or a permanent certificate of occupancy if no temporary certificate is issued, the Owner may request a Final Certificate. The Owner shall file with the Director such information as the Director may deem necessary or useful to evaluate eligibility for the Final Certificate, and shall include:

    1. A statement of expenditures made with respect to each housing unit and the total expenditures made with respect to the entire multifamily housing project;
    2. A description of the completed work and a statement of qualification for the exemption;
    3. A brief written description of the units, and schematic site plans, floor plans, and unit layouts of the Multifamily Housing units and the structure(s) in which they are proposed to be located; every unit layout must include detailed information that adequately demonstrates the number of Bedrooms, consistent with the definition included in Section 5.73.020;
    4. A statement that the work was completed within the required three-year period or any approved extension; and
    5. Information on the Owner's compliance with the affordability requirements in subsections 5.73.040.B and 5.73.040.C.

3. Within 30 days of receipt of all materials required for a Final Certificate, the Director shall determine whether the completed multifamily housing is consistent with the contract between the City and owner, and whether it satisfies the requirements of and is qualified for exemption under this Chapter 5.73.
4. If the Director determines that the multifamily housing has been completed in accordance with the contract between the applicant and the City and the requirements of this Chapter 5.73, the City shall file a Final Certificate of Tax Exemption with the Assessor within ten days of the expiration of the 30-day period provided under subsection 5.73.080.C.
5. The Director shall notify the applicant in writing that the City will not file a Final Certificate if the Director determines that the multifamily housing was not completed within the required three-year period or any approved extension, or was not completed in accordance with the contract between the applicant and the City and the requirements of this Chapter 5.73.
6. The applicant may file an appeal of the Director's decision that a Final Certificate will not be issued to the King County Superior Court within 30 days of receiving notice of that decision.
7. Within two weeks of lease-up of all Affordable Units and no later than January 31 of the first year of tax exemption, the Owner shall file a compliance certification with the Director substantially similar in format and content to the annual property certification described in subsection 5.73.100.A.

#### 5.73.090 - Exemption—Duration—Limits

1. The value of Multifamily Housing qualifying under this Chapter 5.73 will be exempt from ad valorem property taxation as provided in RCW 84.14.020(1) as follows:

    1. For eligible rental Multifamily Housing as provided in Section 5.73.040, for 12 successive years beginning January 1 of the year immediately following the calendar year of issuance of the Final Certificate; or
    2. For eligible units in owner-occupied Multifamily Housing as provided in Section 5.73.040, for eight successive years beginning January 1st of the year immediately following the calendar year of issuance of the Final Certificate; or if at least 20 percent of all units in the owner-occupied Multifamily Housing are eligible units, for 12 successive years beginning January 1 of the year immediately following the calendar year of issuance of the Final Certificate.
2. The exemption does not apply to the value of land or to the value of improvements not qualifying under this Chapter 5.73, nor does the exemption apply to increases in assessed valuation of land and non-qualifying improvements, or to increases made by lawful order of the King County Board of Equalization, the Washington State Department of Revenue, State Board of Tax Appeals, or King County, to a class of property throughout the county or a specific area of the county to achieve uniformity of assessment or appraisal as required by law.

#### 5.73.100 - Annual property certification

1. At such times as may be required by the Director, but no less than annually for the duration of the Compliance Period, the Owner shall file a certification with the Director, verified upon oath or affirmation, which shall contain such information as the Director may deem necessary or useful, and shall include the following information:

    1. A statement of occupancy and vacancy of the Multifamily Housing units during the previous year;
    2. A certification that the Multifamily Housing has not changed use since the date of filing of the Final Certificate of Tax Exemption, and continues to be in compliance with the contract with the City and the requirements of this Chapter 5.73;
    3. A description of any improvements or changes to the Multifamily Housing made after the filing of the Final Certificate of Tax Exemption or last declaration, as applicable;
    4. Information demonstrating compliance with the affordability requirements of subsections 5.73.040.B and 5.73.040.C; and
    5. The income of each renter household at the time of the most recent income verification during the reporting period and the income of each initial purchaser of owner-occupied units at the time of purchase for each of the units receiving a tax exemption, if available.
2. Failure to submit the annual declaration may result in cancellation of the tax exemption.
3. After the end of the Compliance Period, and at such times as may be required by the Director, the Owner shall file a certification with the Director, verified upon oath or affirmation, containing the rent levels being charged for the units that were designated as Affordable Units in the final year of the Compliance Period and for the year following the Compliance Period.
4. The Director will annually analyze rent level information for Affordable units in buildings that received a Final Certificate of Tax Exemption seven years prior, compared with rent levels for market-rate units of comparable size and age that are located in comparable neighborhoods and include this analysis in the Director's annual report to the City Council.

#### 5.73.105 - Annual income certification

1. For renter-occupied Affordable Units, the Owner shall obtain from each tenant, no less than annually, a certification of Family size and Annual Income in form acceptable to the City. For owner-occupied Affordable Units, the Owner must obtain a certification of Family size and Annual Income at initial purchase. The Owner shall examine the income of each tenant Family in accordance with 24 C.F.R 5.609, with guidance from the HUD Occupancy Handbook, 4350.3 Chapter 5. The Owner also shall examine the income and Family size of any tenant Family at any time when there is evidence that the tenant's written statement was not complete or accurate. If so requested by the City, the Owner shall obtain such certifications and/or examine incomes and Family sizes at any other times upon reasonable advance notice from the City. The Owner shall maintain all certifications and documentation obtained under this subsection 5.73.105.A on file for at least six years after they are obtained, and shall make them available to the City for inspection and copying promptly upon request.
2. Owners must attempt to obtain Third Party Verification whenever possible to substantiate income at each certification. The verification documents must be supplied directly to the independent source by the Owner and returned directly to the Owner from the independent source. In the event that the independent source does not respond to the Owner's faxed, mailed, or emailed request for information, the Owner may pursue oral third party verification. If written or oral third party documentation are not available, the Owner may accept original documents (pay stubs, W-2, etc.) at the discretion of the Director and must document why third party verification was not available. At the discretion of the Director, the Owner may accept tenant self-certifications from households in Affordable Units after the initial income verification and first annual recertification.
3. For renter-occupied Affordable Units, the Owner shall continue to charge Income Eligible Occupants no more than the maximum affordable rent allowable until the income of the Family in the Affordable Unit is determined upon recertification to be more than 150 percent of the income limit for the class of the Affordable Unit.
4. If, upon recertification of income, the Annual Income of a Family in one of the Affordable Units exceeds 150 percent of the income limit for the class of the Unit, the Family ceases to be an Income Eligible Occupant. The next available unit of comparable size and amenities must be designated as an Affordable Unit and leased to an Income Eligible Occupant. The initial over-income unit may then be charged a market-rate rent.

#### 5.73.110 - Cancellation of tax exemption—Appeal

1. If at any time the Director determines that the multifamily housing no longer complies with the terms of the contract or with the requirements of this Chapter 5.73, or for any reason no longer qualifies for the tax exemption, the tax exemption shall be canceled and additional taxes, interest, and penalty imposed pursuant to State law.
2. If the owner intends to convert the multifamily housing to another use, the owner must notify the Director and the King County Assessor within 60 days of the change in use. Upon such change in use, the tax exemption shall be canceled and additional taxes, interest, and penalty imposed pursuant to State law.
3. Upon determining that a tax exemption shall be canceled, the Director shall notify the owner by certified mail, return receipt requested. The owner may appeal the determination by filing a notice of appeal with the Hearing Examiner within 30 days, specifying the factual and legal basis for the appeal. The Hearing Examiner will conduct a hearing pursuant to Section 3.02.090 at which all affected parties may be heard and all competent evidence received. The Hearing Examiner shall affirm, modify, or reverse the decision to cancel the exemption based on the evidence received. The Hearing Examiner shall give substantial weight to the Director's decision and the burden of overcoming that weight shall be upon the appellant. An aggrieved party may appeal the Hearing Examiner's decision to the King County Superior Court as provided in RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598.

#### 5.73.120 - Expiration of program.

The program established by this chapter shall expire on December 31, 2019, unless extended by the City Council by ordinance.

Pending applications for a Conditional Certificate, extension of Conditional Certificate and Final Certificate shall be processed as provided in this chapter.

There is hereby established under authority of RCW 35.21.070, as a subfund of the General Fund, a cumulative reserve fund for several different municipal purposes as well as certain specific municipal purposes as follows:


1. The making of any public improvement, including but not limited to the construction, alteration, renovation or repair of City buildings; the establishment, widening and extending of streets and highways; and the construction and repair of sewers;
2. Investigations and studies in connection with any public improvement;
3. The acquisition of real property;
4. The purchase of supplies, material or equipment as specified in the ordinance making an appropriation therefor;
5. Civil defense;
6. The provision of low-income housing;
7. The provision of reserves for revenue stabilization for future operations;
8. Short-term loans for capital projects to meet cash-flow requirements, provided that a source of repayment is identified and that a schedule and term of repayment are specified;
9. The financing of capital projects specified in the capital facilities element of the City's Comprehensive Plan and housing relocation assistance, as authorized by Chapter 82.64 RCW;
10. The matching of federal or state funds for any of the foregoing or any other municipal purpose the nature of which shall be specified in the appropriating ordinance.

The subfund shall be known as the Cumulative Reserve Subfund.


#### 5.80.020 - Structure of subfund.

The Cumulative Reserve Subfund shall be comprised of two accounts: the Capital Projects Account, with its several subaccounts, and the Revenue Stabilization Account.


1. The Capital Projects Account shall be comprised of several subaccounts, including but not limited to the Real Estate Excise Tax I Subaccount; the Real Estate Excise Tax II Subaccount; the South Lake Union Property Proceeds Subaccount; the Asset Preservation Subaccount - General Facilities; the Bluefield Habitat Maintenance Subaccount; and the Unrestricted Subaccount. Expenditures from the Capital Projects Account shall require an ordinance adopted by a majority of the members of the City Council.
2. The Revenue Stabilization Account shall be used for revenue stabilization for future City operations and to fund activities that would otherwise be reduced in scope, suspended or eliminated due to unanticipated shortfalls in General Subfund revenues. Transfers into and expenditures from the Revenue Stabilization Account shall occur as follows:

    1. Expenditures from the Revenue Stabilization Account shall require an ordinance. An assessment of the City's long-term financial outlook should be considered when making decisions about how much to expend from the Revenue Stabilization Account, including a projection of how Revenue Stabilization Account resources are expected to be used and at least partially replenished over the following four years.
    2. The Revenue Stabilization Account shall be funded by (a) transfers by ordinance, (b) automatic transfer of 0.25 percent of General Subfund tax revenues forecast for 2012 and the automatic transfer of 0.50 percent of forecast General Subfund tax revenues for each year thereafter, and (c) upon completion of fiscal year accounting, automatic transfer of 50 percent of the ending General Subfund fund balance, less encumbrances, carryforwards as authorized by ordinance or state law, and planned reserve amounts reflected in the adopted budget, that is in excess of the latest revised estimate of the unreserved ending fund balance for that closed fiscal year (as published in the adopted budget). A transfer as described in subsection 5.80.020.B.2.c shall occur at that time the City completes its accounting for the closed fiscal year.
    3. For purposes of this subsection 5.80.020.B, the phrase "tax revenues" means all tax revenues deposited into the General Subfund, including but not limited to, tax revenue from the regular property tax levy, business and occupation tax, utility business taxes, the portion of admissions tax not dedicated to the Arts Account, leasehold excise tax, gambling taxes, and sales and use taxes.
    4. At no time shall the balance of the Revenue Stabilization Account exceed 5 percent of the General Subfund tax revenues forecast underlying the adopted budget for the current fiscal year. Automatic transfers of funds into the Revenue Stabilization Account as required by subsection 5.80.020.B.2 shall be made only to the extent that the fund balance for the Revenue Stabilization Account does not exceed 5 percent of the tax revenues forecast for the current fiscal year, and the automatic transfer of any amount that would result in such an excess shall be suspended.
    5. When the Revenue Stabilization Account balance reaches 5 percent of forecast tax revenues, and automatic transfers are suspended, the amount that would have been automatically transferred into the Revenue Stabilization Account had the Revenue Stabilization Account not reached its maximum-allowed fund balance should be used to pay for existing obligations rather than to fund new programs.
    6. The transfer of 0.50 percent of General Subfund tax revenues and 50 percent of General Subfund year-end balances that is described in subsection 5.80.020.B.2 shall be temporarily suspended when revenue forecasts underlying the adopted budget anticipate a nominal decline in General Subfund revenues, as compared to the revenue forecasts underlying the adopted budget for the fiscal year immediately prior. Automatic transfers shall remain suspended until positive revenue growth is reflected in the revenue forecasts underlying the adopted budget.
    7. In the first year during which positive revenue growth is again forecast, the automatic transfer of tax revenues described in subsection 5.80.020.B.2.b shall be limited to 0.25 percent, followed by an automatic transfer of 0.50 percent in each year thereafter, unless the City again forecasts a nominal decline in General Subfund tax revenues or the value of the Revenue Stabilization Account reaches 5 percent of forecast tax revenues.
    8. The automatic transfer of 0.25 percent or 0.50 percent of General Subfund tax revenues that is described in subsections 5.80.020.B.2.b and 5.80.020.B.7 shall also be temporarily suspended in any year that an expenditure from the Revenue Stabilization Account is authorized in the adopted budget.

1. The Real Estate Excise Tax I Subaccount shall be comprised of the first 0.25-percent excise tax on real estate sales collected on or after May 1, 1992. It shall be expended only for the purposes and capital projects contemplated by RCW 82.46.010.
2. The Real Estate Excise Tax II Subaccount shall be comprised of the second 0.25-percent excise tax on real estate sales collected on or after May 1, 1992. It shall be used solely for the purposes and capital projects contemplated by RCW 82.46.035.

4. The South Lake Union Property Proceeds Subaccount shall, unless provided otherwise by ordinance, be comprised of revenues from sales of certain surplus City property located adjacent to South Lake Union, investment earnings attributable to the Subaccount, and other revenues identified through ordinance.

Expenditures from the Asset Preservation Subaccount — General Facilities shall be limited to projects intended to preserve or extend the useful life and operational capability of capital facilities and shall be appropriated through the annual budget process or by other ordinance, consistent with the Capital Improvement Program of the Department of Finance and Administrative Services.
6. The Street Vacation Subaccount shall, unless provided otherwise by ordinance, be comprised of one-half of the revenue received by the City as compensation for any street or alley that is vacated. Expenditures shall be dedicated to the acquisition, improvement, and development of public open space or transportation capital projects.
7. The Bluefield Habitat Maintenance Subaccount shall, unless provided otherwise by ordinance, be comprised of contributions from Bluefield Holdings along with interest earnings on those contributions.
