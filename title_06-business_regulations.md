#### 6.02.200 - Police Department relieved of duty to investigate applications.

The Chief of Police and the Police Department are relieved of the duty to investigate applications for license renewals and all parts of this subtitle (Ordinance 48022) imposing such duty are superseded, provided that this provision shall not preclude the Chief of Police from making such investigation of applicants for license renewal as may be requested by the Director of Finance and Administrative Services.

Such information shall be confidential unless a hearing is requested on such application; provided that any such information shall be made available to the applicant upon his/her written request therefor. All information, complaints or objections so received shall be investigated and considered by the Director prior to issuing or denying such license.


#### 6.02.240 - Issuance of license—Notice to complainants—Hearing.

    2. If the renewal application is received after thirty (30) days into the new license year: twenty (20) percent or Twenty-five Dollars ($25), whichever is greater.
2. No annual license shall be issued until any late renewal fee has been paid; provided that payment of the late renewal fee may be waived whenever the Director finds that timely application was beyond the control of the licensee by reason of severe circumstances; for example, serious illness of the licensee, death or incapacity of an accountant or other person who retains possession of the licensee's license records, loss of business records due to theft, fire, flood or other similar acts.
3. Nothing in this section shall apply to the renewal of dog or cat licenses governed by the provisions of Section 6.16.010 of this subtitle.

    2.

#### 6.02.290 - Revocation or refusal to renew procedure

1. Actions to revoke or refuse to renew any license shall be commenced by the Director of Finance and Administrative Services by issuing a notice pursuant to subsection 6.02.290.E or by any other person by filing in the office of the Director a written complaint setting forth in specific terms the basis therefor. The Director shall mail a copy of such complaint by certified mail to the licensee at his or her last address as shown by the license records of the Director, and shall be accompanied by a notice that such license may be revoked or not renewed.
2. The licensee shall, within ten days after receiving any such complaint, mail by certified mail to the complainant and file with the Director his or her written answer, which shall admit or deny the allegations of such complaint and may set forth such defenses and/or additional matter as the licensee shall deem appropriate.
3. The Director shall conduct an investigation, and if cause exists may revoke or refuse to renew such license; provided, that if the Director finds upon a sufficient showing that the conduct complained of has been corrected and is unlikely to be repeated, he or she may dismiss any such complaint; and provided further, that the complaint shall be dismissed by the Director where the conduct complained of has been corrected under a written agreement between the complainant and licensee approved by the Director.
4. If a complaint has been filed, the Director shall mail to the complainant and to the licensee by certified mail a notice of the action summarizing his or her findings and conclusions. In all cases in which a complaint is dismissed other than upon a written agreement between the complainant and licensee, the complainant may within ten days of the mailing of the notice of the Director's action submit a written request for a hearing together with the appropriate Hearing Examiner filing fee, which the Director shall transmit to the Hearing Examiner.
5. If the Director determines that grounds exist to revoke or refuse to renew a license, the Director shall notify such licensee in writing by certified mail of the revocation or refusal to renew and on what grounds the decision was based. The notice shall include a recital of the licensee's right to an appeal.
6. The licensee may appeal a revocation or refusal to renew by filing a written notice of appeal ("petition"), setting forth the grounds therefor, with the Office of the Hearing Examiner. The licensee shall provide a copy of the petition to the Director and the City Attorney on or before the date the petition is filed with the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner shall conduct the hearing in accordance with the procedures for hearing contested cases in Chapter 3.02. The Hearing Examiner shall set a date for hearing the appeal and notify the licensee of the time and place of the hearing.

In the event that the tobacco product retailer or an agent or employee thereof fails to request and examine such identification before making a tobacco product sale and the purchaser was, in fact, less that eighteen (18) years old at the time such failure occurs, such retailer shall be deemed to have had no conclusive basis for determining that a tobacco product sale could lawfully be made to such purchaser.

#### 6.240.210 - Defense to alleged violation of SMC Section 6.240.100.

1. The establishment, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a tobacco product retailer acted in good faith to prevent a violation of SMC Section 6.240.100 and that any such violation occurred despite such retailer's exercising of due diligence, shall be a valid defense against allegation that such retailer violated SMC Section 6.240.100.
2. A tobacco product retailer may establish that he, she, or it exercised due diligence to prevent a violation of SMC Section 6.240.100 only by proving that such retailer:

### Chapter 6.270 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT

Sections:

#### 6.270.010 - Findings of fact.

Based on public testimony and other evidence and information before it, the Seattle City Council makes the following findings of fact:


1. Certain conduct occurring on premises offering adult entertainment is detrimental to the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City and therefore, such conduct must be regulated as provided herein.
2. Regulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred.
3. It is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors; to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult; and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name, which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible.
4. It is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of an establishment during the establishment's hours of operation so that there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment, including the actions of patrons, entertainers and other employees.
5. The license fees required herein are nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the City in regulating the adult entertainment industry.
6. Businesses providing adult entertainment are increasingly associated with ongoing prostitution, disruptive conduct and other criminal activity which is currently not subject to effective regulation and which constitutes an immediate threat to the public peace, health and safety.

#### 6.270.020 - Application of other provisions.

Funds shall be distributed by reimbursement for documented, itemized costs.

##### 6.310.605 - Monetary penalties and penalty points

"Failure to appear for inspection scheduled by the Director" includes a late arrival for the inspection. If notification that the vehicle cannot appear is made prior to the close of business on the business day before the scheduled inspection, and the taxicab plates are delivered to the inspection facility prior to the original inspection time, then no penalty will be due.


1. Penalties and penalty points are attributed to the taxicab association or transportation network company with which the taxicab and/or for-hire driver is affiliated at the time the violation occurs.
As soon as an association, for-hire vehicle company, or TNC accumulates more than five penalty points per affiliated taxicab, for-hire vehicle, or TNC endorsed vehicle on average, it must pay a penalty to the Director of $100 per affiliated taxicab, for-hire vehicle, or TNC endorsed vehicle. As soon as an association, for-hire vehicle company, or TNC accumulates more than seven penalty points per affiliated taxicab, for-hire vehicle, or TNC endorsed vehicle on average, it must pay an additional penalty to the Director of $150 per affiliated taxicab, for-hire vehicle, or TNC endorsed vehicle. As soon as an association, for-hire vehicle company, or TNC accumulates more than ten points per affiliated taxicab, for-hire vehicle, or TNC endorsed vehicle on average, it must pay an additional penalty to the Director of $250 per affiliated taxicab, for-hire vehicle, or TNC endorsed vehicle. For purposes of this subsection, average number of penalty points per affiliated taxicab, for-hire vehicle or TNC endorsed vehicle means total penalty points divided by number of taxicabs, for-hire vehicles or TNC endorsed vehicles within the association, for-hire vehicle company, or TNC. (The Director will compute the number of taxicabs, for-hire vehicles or TNC endorsed vehicles within the association, for-hire vehicle company, or TNC by averaging the number of TNC endorsed vehicles, taxicabs or for-hire vehicles in the association, for-hire vehicle company or TNC (rounded up) at the beginning of the year and the number of cabs, for-hire vehicles or TNC endorsed vehicles at the end of each completed quarter, (i.e., March 31st, June 30th, etc.). If an association, for-hire vehicle company, or TNC has exceeded the average amount of penalty points as outlined above, the penalty will be due as of the end of the current quarter. The association, for-hire vehicle company or TNC may ask for a hearing with the Director concerning the assessment of such penalty. At such hearing the association, for-hire vehicle company or TNC will present any evidence to refute or mitigate its performance. After the hearing, the Director may impose the penalty, reduce the penalty, or with just cause waive the penalty and put the association or TNC on probation with specific performance guidelines. If the association, for-hire vehicle company or TNC does not meet the guidelines imposed, the Director will impose the penalty. In any case, the Director's decision is final.

Upon renewal of the taxicab association or TNC license, the association or TNC will start the new year with zero penalty points. For-hire vehicle companies will start each new calendar year with zero penalty points.

A Class C violation by a TNC shall result in revocation of the TNC license.


1. For-hire driver, transportation network company driver for-hire vehicle company, or taxicab/ for-hire vehicle violations
2. Taxicab association, for-hire vehicle company, or transportation network company violations during a calendar year
3. Taxicab or for-hire vehicle owner's responsibility for penalties incurred by for-hire drivers. A taxicab or for-hire vehicle owner is jointly and severally liable for each monetary penalty assessed against any for-hire driver who commits a violation while operating a taxicab or for-hire vehicle belonging to that owner. The City is not required to pursue collection of the penalty from the driver as a prerequisite to pursuing collection of the penalty from the owner.
4. Taxicab association's or transportation network company's responsibility for penalties incurred by for-hire drivers and taxicab owners. In addition to incurring penalty points, the taxicab association or TNC is jointly and severally liable for each monetary penalty assessed against any for-hire driver, TNC endorsed vehicle or taxicab affiliated with the taxicab association. The City is not required to pursue collection of the penalty from the for-hire driver or the taxicab owner as a prerequisite to pursuing collection of the penalty from the taxicab association or TNC.

The fare for service must be agreed upon prior to departure. Under no circumstances may customers or customers' agents make arrangements to immediately engage the services of a carrier's limousine with the chauffeur, even if the chauffeur is an owner or officer of the company with the single exception of stand-hail limousines only at a facility owned and operated by a port district in a county with a population of one million or more that are licensed and restricted by the rules and policies set forth by the port district.

Footnote to Tables B and C:

A Grade IV Boiler Fireman may operate more than two (2) steam or vapor boilers with a greater combined capacity when the fireman is the head fireman on duty and under the direct on-site supervision of a licensed steam engineer for the purpose of training. The boilers shall not exceed the capacity permitted by the license of the supervising engineer.


1. The minimum requirements for operation and inspection of each type and capacity of equipment are as set forth in this Section and Tables B and C of this Section 6.420.100.
2. Constant attendance. When constant attendance is required by this chapter, the engineer or boiler fireman in charge of a boiler, boiler plant, or steam engine shall not leave the boiler room or engine room when the boiler or steam engine is being operated without first either stopping the steam engine and shutting off all sources of heat in the boiler, or being relieved by a person duly licensed under this chapter.
3. Checked by boiler supervisor. When this chapter requires a boiler to be checked by a boiler supervisor, the boiler supervisor shall inspect all controls and safety devices pursuant to the requirements of Section 6.420.120 D, as a minimum.
4. Checked by licensed operator. When this chapter requires a boiler to be checked by a licensed operator, a person holding a license issued under this chapter shall perform a physical examination of the boiler or engine to ensure proper operation and maintenance pursuant to the requirements of Sections 6.420.110 and 6.420.150, as a minimum.
5. Twice daily check. When this chapter requires twice daily checks, the inspections that are required to be recorded in the boiler logbook by Section 6.420.110 shall be performed at least two (2) times each day. The first check of the day shall be made not less than eight (8) hours after the last recorded check of the previous day; the second check of the day shall be made at least six (6) hours after the first recorded check of the day. Additional checks may be made to ensure safe operation of a boiler. Twice daily checks may not be performed by a Boiler Supervisor unless the Boiler Supervisor is a full time employee of the boiler owner.
6. Check once every two (2) hours. When this chapter requires a check every two (2) hours, a physical examination of the boiler or engine to ensure proper operation and maintenance pursuant to the requirements of Sections 6.420.110 and 6.420.150, as a minimum, shall be made at least once every two (2) hours.
7. For purposes of Tables B and C, the input ratings of boilers shall be computed as follows:

    1. For gas, propane and similar burners, the rating shall be equal to the burner input as rated and labeled by the burner manufacturer. Where actual fuel flow during burner operation at the maximum firing rate can be reliably measured, the burner input may be computed by such method.
    2. For oil burners, the rating shall be equal to the gallons-per-hour rating of the fuel nozzle or nozzles.
    3. For electric boilers the rating shall be equal to the electrical input in KW as rated and labeled by the boiler manufacturer.
    4. In the case of multiple fuel burners, the rating shall be the greater of all computed inputs.
    5. For boilers in battery (connected to a common header), the rating shall be the cumulative input, as measured in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, or 4 above. For boilers in battery wired so that only a single boiler can operate at a given time, the license requirement shall be determined by the most restrictive individual license requirement for any boiler in the battery.
    6. For regenerative systems, the BHP of the prime mover (gas turbine, engine, etc.) will determine the grade for downstream recovery boilers and steam turbines.
8. All checks of boilers pursuant to the requirements of this chapter shall be logged and recorded as set forth in Section 6.420.110.

6. The licensee is a person who has been certified pursuant to RCW 74.20A.320 by the Washington Department of Social and Health Services as a person who is not in compliance with a support order. If the person has continued to meet all other requirements for reinstatement during the suspension, reissuance of the license shall be automatic upon the Director's receipt of a release issued by the Washington Department of Social and Health Services stating that the licensee is in compliance with the order; or
7. The licensee, manager, or any employee or agent of a licensee knew or had reason to know that a violation of this Chapter 6.500 was occurring or about to occur and such licensee, manager, employee, or agent failed to either prevent or report to proper law enforcement authorities the violation.

#### 6.500.145 - License revocation

In addition to the reasons set forth in Section 6.202.230 as now or hereafter amended, any license issued under this Chapter 6.500 may be revoked upon a finding that:


1. The licensee has committed three or more violations of this Chapter 6.500 within a 12-month period; or
2. The licensee has failed to cure any condition for which a suspension was issued within 30 days of the time when such condition could have been reasonably cured; or
3. The property at which the business is located has been determined by a court to be a chronic nuisance property as provided in Chapter 10.09.

#### 6.500.147 - Suspension or revocation; effective date; length

1. Except for summary suspensions under Section 6.500.150, suspensions or revocations become effective upon the date of issuance of any notice of suspension or revocation or, in the event of an appeal, when a final ruling on appeal affirming the Director's findings is issued.
2. Length of suspensions

    1. Unless a time period is specified in a particular section of this Chapter 6.500, suspensions shall extend until evidence is produced to the Director showing by preponderance that the violation is cured. Where a violation cannot be cured, suspensions shall extend one month or until the license expires, whichever occurs first. Licensees must submit a written request for reinstatement to the Director after the period of suspension has passed.
    2. The Department shall post a suspension notice in a conspicuous place on or about the licensed premises. The notice shall state that the license has been suspended by order of the Director.
    3. During the period of license suspension, the licensee, its manager, employees, and agents:

        1. Are required to comply with all applicable laws;
        2. Shall not remove, alter, or cover the posted suspension notice, and may not permit another person to do so;
        3. Shall not place or permit the placement of any statement on the licensed premises indicating that the premises has been closed for any reason other than as stated in the suspension notice;
        4. Shall not advertise by any means that the licensed premises is closed for any reason other than as stated in the suspension notice.
    4. During the period of license suspension:

        1. The licensee shall not operate the marijuana business; and
        2. No sale, delivery, service, destruction, removal, or receipt of marijuana or marijuana products shall be conducted by the licensee.
    5. Upon approval by the Director, a licensee may take necessary measures to keep current stock that is on hand at the time of the suspension from spoiling or becoming unsalable during a suspension, provided that such measures shall not include processing the product.
    6. If the Director has ordered a license suspended, the applicant may contest the suspension to the Hearing Examiner in the same manner as that provided under Section 6.202.270 to contest license denials, revocations, or refusals to renew.
3. Length of Revocation. Revocations shall extend until the end of the annual license period. The licensee or any person in which the licensee is a principal, or any person who is or was a principal of the licensee, shall not again be licensed during such period.
4. Except in cases involving summary suspension, whenever a timely notice of appeal under Section 6.202.270 is filed, a licensee may continue to engage in the activity for which the license is required pending a final decision.

#### 6.500.150 - License—Summary suspension

1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter 6.500, a license may be summarily suspended, with such suspension to take effect immediately by order of the Director prior to hearing upon finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that the activity licensed under this Chapter 6.500 and engaged in by the licensee causes or will cause a clear, substantial, and imminent hazard to life, safety, property, or privacy.
2. Whenever any license is summarily suspended a hearing by the Hearing Examiner may be requested by the licensee within ten days after the date of suspension. The Director may waive the ten day requirement upon satisfaction that failure to submit the request was beyond the control of the licensee. Such hearing shall be held within five days of the request, unless a later date is agreed to by the licensee, with a minimum 48-hours' notice to the licensee, and shall be conducted by the Hearing Examiner according to the Hearing Examiner rules for contested cases. The Director shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the activity engaged in by the licensee causes or will cause a clear, substantial and imminent hazard to life, safety, property, or privacy. The Hearing Examiner shall issue the decision within ten days of the date of the hearing.
3. If the applicant does not file a timely request for hearing, the Director's order for summary suspension shall be final and the suspension shall remain in effect until such time as the Director determines that the hazard no longer exists.

#### 6.500.160 - Seizure or confiscation of marijuana and marijuana products

The Department, its authorized agents, or the Seattle Police Department may seize or confiscate (1) all marijuana or marijuana products in the possession of a marijuana business that does not have a valid license issued pursuant to this Chapter 6.500 and that is not exempt pursuant to subsections 6.500.050.B or 6.500.050.C from obtaining a license, and (2) all marijuana or marijuana products that do not meet any or all of requirements of this Chapter 6.500 or any rules promulgated pursuant to this Chapter 6.500.

Nothing in this Section 6.500.160 shall be construed to limit the authority of any law enforcement officer to seize or confiscate marijuana or marijuana products pursuant to any other law.


#### 6.500.170 - Penalties

The violation or failure to comply with any provision of this Chapter 6.500 shall constitute a civil violation and shall be enforced under the citation provisions set forth in this Section 6.500.170 by the Director, provided, however, that this Section 6.500.170 shall not be construed as preventing the enforcement of alternative criminal penalties under Section 6.500.175.

A person must respond to a citation in one of the following ways:


1. Paying the amount of the monetary penalty specified in the citation, in which case the record shall show a finding that the person cited committed the violation; or
2. Requesting in writing a mitigation hearing to explain the circumstances surrounding the commission of the violation and providing an address to which notice of such hearing may be sent; or
3. Requesting a contested hearing in writing specifying the reason why the cited violation did not occur or why the person cited is not responsible for the violation, and providing an address to which notice of such hearing may be sent.
4. A response to a citation must be received by the Office of the Hearing Examiner no later than 15 days after the date the citation is served. When the last day of the appeal period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day.
Failure to appear for a requested hearing will result in an order being entered finding that the person cited committed the violation stated in the citation and assessing the penalty specified in the citation. For good cause shown and upon terms the Hearing Examiner deems just, the Hearing Examiner may set aside an order entered upon a failure to appear.

If the person or entity cited fails to pay a penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter, the penalty may be referred to a collection agency. The cost to the City for the collection services will be assessed as costs, at the rate agreed to between the City and the collection agency, and added to the penalty. Alternatively, the City may pursue collection in any other manner allowed by law.

Each day a person or entity violates or fails to comply with a provision referenced in 6.500.170 may be considered a separate violation for which a citation may be issued.


1. Civil Violations
2. Citation

    1. If after investigation the Director determines that the standards or requirements of provisions of this Chapter 6.500 have been violated, the Director may issue a citation to the owner and/or other person or entity responsible for the violation. The citation shall include the following information: (1) the name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued; (2) a reasonable description of the location of the property on which the violation occurred; (3) a separate statement of each standard or requirement violated; (4) the date of the violation; (5) a statement that the person cited must respond to the citation within 15 days after service; (6) a space for entry of the applicable penalty; (7) a statement that a response must be sent to the Hearing Examiner and received not later than 5 p.m. on the day the response is due; (8) the name, address, and phone number of the Hearing Examiner where the citation is to be filed; (9) a statement that the citation represents a determination that a violation has been committed by the person named in the citation and that the determination shall be final unless contested as provided in this Chapter 6.500; and (10) a certified statement of the Director's representative issuing the citation, authorized by RCW 9A.72.085, setting forth facts supporting issuance of the citation.
    2. The citation may be served by personal service in the manner set forth in RCW 4.28.080 for service of a summons or sent by first class mail, addressed to the last known address of such person(s). Service shall be complete at the time of personal service, or if mailed, on the date of mailing. If a citation sent by first class mail is returned as undeliverable, service may be made by posting the citation at a conspicuous place on the property.
3. Response to Citation
4. Failure to respond. If a person fails to respond to a citation within 15 days of service, an order shall be entered by the Hearing Examiner finding that the person cited committed the violation stated in the citation, and assessing the penalty specified in the citation.
5. Mitigation hearings

    1. Date and Notice. If a person requests a mitigation hearing, the mitigation hearing shall be held within 30 days after written response to the citation requesting a hearing is received by the Hearing Examiner. Notice of the time, place, and date of the hearing shall be sent to the address specified in the request for hearing not less than ten days before the date of the hearing.
    2. Procedure at Hearing. The Hearing Examiner shall hold an informal hearing that shall not be governed by the Rules of Evidence. The person cited may present witnesses, but witnesses shall not be compelled to attend. A representative from the Department of Transportation may also be present and may present additional information, but attendance by a representative from the Department of Transportation is not required.
    3. Disposition. The Hearing Examiner shall determine whether the person's explanation justifies reduction of the monetary penalty. Factors that may be considered in whether to reduce the penalty include whether the violation was caused by the act, neglect, or abuse of another.
    4. Entry of Order. After hearing the explanation of the person cited and any other information presented at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation and assessing a monetary penalty in an amount determined pursuant to 6.500.170.H. The Hearing Examiner's decision is the final decision of the City on the matter.
6. Contested hearing

    1. Date and Notice. If a person requests a contested hearing, the hearing shall be held within 60 days after the written response to the citation requesting such hearing is received.
    2. Hearing. Contested hearings shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures for hearing contested cases contained in 3.02.090 and the rules adopted by the Hearing Examiner for hearing contested cases, except as modified by this Section 6.500.170. The issues heard at the hearing shall be limited to those that are raised in writing in the response to the citation and that are within the jurisdiction of the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.
    3. Sufficiency. No citation shall be deemed insufficient for failure to contain a detailed statement of the facts constituting the specific violation which the person cited is alleged to have committed or by reason of defects or imperfections, provided such lack of detail or such defects or imperfections do not prejudice substantial rights of the person cited.
    4. Amendment of Citation. A citation may be amended prior to the conclusion of the hearing to conform to the evidence presented if substantial rights of the person cited are not thereby prejudiced.
    5. Evidence at Hearing. The certified statement or declaration authorized by RCW 9A.72.085 shall be prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and that the person cited is responsible. The certified statement or declaration authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 and any other evidence accompanying the report shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. The person cited may rebut the Department of Transportation evidence and establish that the cited violation(s) did not occur or that the person contesting the citation is not responsible for the violation.
    6. Disposition. The Hearing Examiner shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether the violation occurred. If the Hearing Examiner determines that the violation occurred, the citation shall be sustained and the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation and imposing the applicable penalty. If the Hearing Examiner determines that the violation did not occur, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order dismissing the citation.
    7. Final Decision. The Hearing Examiner's decision is the final decision of the City.
7. Failure to appear for hearing
8. Penalties

    1. The following penalties shall be assessed for violations of any provision of this Chapter 6.500 other than Section 6.500.030 and any provision of the Washington Administrative Code:

        1. $500 for the first violation, and
        2. $1,000 for each subsequent violation within a 12-month period.
    2. The following penalties shall be assessed for violations of Section 6.500.030:

        1. $1,000 for the first violation, and
        2. $1,500 for each subsequent violation within a six-month period.
    3. Violations of or failure to comply with provisions of the Washington Administrative Code that have been adopted by the Director pursuant to Section 6.500.100 shall have the same monetary penalties as those set forth in the applicable provisions of Washington Administrative Code adopted by the Director.
9. Collection of penalties
10. Each day a separate violation

#### 6.500.175 - Alternative criminal penalty

Any person who violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this Chapter 6.500 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor subject to the provisions of Chapters 12A.02 and 12A.04, except that absolute liability shall be imposed for such a violation or failure to comply and none of the mental states described in 12A.04.030 need be proved. The Director may request the City Attorney to prosecute such violations criminally as an alternative to the citation procedure outlined in this Chapter 6.500.


#### 6.500.178 - Additional relief

The Director may seek legal or equitable relief at any time to enjoin any acts or practices that violate the provisions of this Chapter 6.500 or abate any condition that constitutes a nuisance.
