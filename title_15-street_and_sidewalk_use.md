When a permit authorizes displacement of privately-owned property in the public place, the permittee shall first give notice to the property owner, if known, and allow the property owner an opportunity to remove the property in the public place.

#### 15.02.070 - Nearest equivalent

Unless the permit expressly provides otherwise, the commemoration shall be removed between the hours of 12:01 a.m. and 6 a.m. each day. An appropriate sign shall be placed near the commemoration identifying the owner of the commemoration and the location as a public forum.


#### 15.02.090 - Appeals to Municipal Court

If an applicant asserts a right protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article I, Sections 3, 4, and 5 of the Washington Constitution, and is aggrieved by an action of the City in denying a permit, the applicant may, within 30-calendar days, petition the presiding judge of the Seattle Municipal Court for a prompt review. The matter shall be granted priority as a case involving constitutional liberties and shall be heard in the manner provided by the Municipal Court by rule, and the decision of the Municipal Court shall be final subject only to judicial review.


#### 15.02.100 - Effect of ordinance

Title 15 prohibits an action or activity whenever it requires a permit for a "use" defined in Section 15.02.048, and:

2. The permittee is granted a permit upon conditions or subject to restrictions and the permittee fails to comply; or
3. The City, by policy, does not issue permits for that type of use.
Issuing permits under Title 15 is discretionary; Title 15 does not create any right to a permit.


#### 15.02.110 - Authority cumulative

The authority granted by Title 15 to any City officer or employee is in addition to and supplemental of powers granted by other sections of the Seattle Municipal Code or City ordinances and does not limit any other authority granted to City officials by other ordinances or laws.

#### 15.04.035 - Approval; considerations

1. If the application conforms to the requirements of Title 15 and the proposed use is consistent with the rights of the public, the authorizing official may approve the application; fix the duration and the terms or conditions of the permit; and when required, upon the applicant's furnishing of a deposit or surety bond, insurance, covenant, and indemnification, and payment of all required fees; issue the permit. The original permit shall remain in the custody of the City, and a copy shall be given to the permittee and shall be posted or available at the site.
2. The permit may specify the portion of the public place that may be occupied, the dates or days and hours of use, and the allowed use. The permit shall only be valid for the portion of the public place, the dates or days and hours of use, and the use as identified on the permit.
3. Factors for consideration in evaluating an application for a permit include, but are not limited to, the applicant's constitutional rights and the abutter's property rights; the site and its terrain; the public and private benefits of the proposed use; and the impact of the proposed use on the following:

    1. The paramount purpose of streets for travel and transportation;
    2. Utilities; authorized secondary street uses; and any use being made by the public of the site;
    3. Fire access and public safety;
    4. Uses under permit; street trees; and other proposed or past uses of the site;
    5. Rights of light, air, and access and lateral support of abutting properties and on access or easements of properties dependent upon the public place for access;
    6. The environment, including but not limited to efforts to minimize impervious surface, loss of native vegetation, and stormwater runoff;
    7. Drainage, surface and underground; springs and watercourses; and the stability of soils; and
    8. Where applicable, City land use, transportation, open space, shoreline, and beautification policies and approved neighborhood land use plans.

    1. For public places under the jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation, their character as a park drive or boulevard, or as open space;
    2. For shoreline street ends, their purpose to provide the public with visual or physical access to the water and the shoreline;
    3. For submerged streets, the Harbor Code, Title 16;
    4. For environmentally critical areas, the requirements of Chapter 25.09; and
    5. For streets or public places in the process of being vacated, the use after the vacation.

#### 15.04.037 - Overview of indemnity deposit, accounts, escrow, insurance, and surety bond

1. Sections 15.04.040 through 15.04.060 are coordinated elements of a package of protections intended to: assist the City in collection of expenses charged under the Street Use Ordinance and costs associated with a use under a permit; assure performance of the requirements of the Street Use Ordinance and the covenants or conditions in a permit; place on the permittee the risks associated with the use and provide a degree of financial responsibility in the event of an accident or injury; restore the public place when the permittee's use has been revoked or terminated to at least as good a condition as required by current applicable standards; and protect the public treasury. The City's acceptance of an indemnity deposit, an escrow account, a surety bond, or insurance; or the establishment of a subaccount in the City Treasury in favor of an applicant or a permittee does not limit an applicant's or a permittee's liability to the amount deposited or stated in the instrument.
2. Sections 15.04.040 through 15.04.060 relate to each other as follows:

    1. A deposit with the City under Section 15.04.040 provides a source of funds, held by the City, to pay probable City expenditures arising from a proposed use or restoration of the public place after the use; the time of City employees for inspection and Code enforcement; and ancillary City expenses. Annual fees are billed separately.
    2. An escrow account maintained under Section 15.04.042 may be an alternative to a deposit under Section 15.04.040 for amounts at or over $1,000; or to provide a surety bond under Section 15.04.044 in an amount up to $10,000; or a supplement to either or both of them. An escrow account differs from a deposit in that the deposit holder, rather than the City, is a public depository; interest on the deposit accrues to the account, rather than to the City; and withdrawals from the account are governed by the escrow agreement rather than by City rules on guaranty deposits.
    3. A subaccount under Section 15.04.050 establishes a balance with the City in favor of the applicant or permittee against which a City department may deduct fees and charges as they occur, including annual fees and deposits for particular permits.
    4. A surety bond under Section 15.04.044 provides a promise by a licensed surety company, within the limits and according to the terms of the bond, to perform work or pay the City's expenses to perform the work in the event of the permittee's default. A surety bond is not a substitute for providing the City public liability insurance for any tortious injury.
    5. Liability insurance under Section 15.04.045 protects the City as an additional insured from public liability as a result of an accident, injury, or damage arising from the use of a public place; and assists in making permittees financially responsible for meeting liabilities that may arise from their use of public places.
    6. The covenant for indemnity under Section 15.04.060 holds the City harmless from all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense, or damages of every kind and description. It applies independently of the foregoing and authorizes a tender of defense by the City to the permittee in the event of a suit, action, or claim arising from the use.
    7. Section 15.04.017 empowers an authorized official, when required to do so by a constitutional provision, or state or federal law, to waive compliance with any of the Sections 15.04.040 through 15.04.060.
3. The amount set by an authorizing official for an indemnity deposit, an escrow account, or a surety bond; and the correctness of a charge or deduction shown on the City's account statement or made from an escrow account; shall be subject to review or reconsideration according to Section 15.04.112.

#### 15.04.040 - Indemnity deposit—Escrow—Surety bond

1. If the authorizing official determines that there is a substantial risk of injury, damage, or expense to the City or probable City expenditures arising from an applicant's proposed use of any public place; the authorizing official may require the applicant to make an indemnity deposit with the Director of Finance and Administrative Services in an amount based on the official's estimate of the injury, damage, or expense to the City; or cost of restoring the public place if a mishap or accident occurs. The funds shall be deposited to the credit of the Guaranty Deposit Fund.
2. The indemnity deposit shall be used to pay the cost of: restoring the public place: removing any earth or other debris; replacing or repairing any damaged utility or trees in the public place; completing any work left unfinished; resetting any traffic control devices; engineering and other studies authorized by Section 15.04.035, and any other expense that the City may sustain in conjunction with the permitted work and; a City administrative charge equal to 15 percent of the amounts expended for the City's expenses for services such as inspections, surveys, preparing plans, letting contracts, and contract administration or supervision. The balance of the cash indemnity deposit, if any, after all deductions shall be returned to the applicant or permittee. If the indemnity deposit is insufficient, the applicant or permittee shall be liable for the deficiency.
3. The authorizing official may authorize the filing of a surety bond in accordance with Section 15.04.044 in lieu of making all or part of an indemnity deposit and may suspend its application or waive compliance when required by Section 15.02.027.

#### 15.04.042 - Escrow

An authorizing official may accept the establishment of an escrow account in a qualified public depository as defined in RCW 39.58 that is eligible to receive City moneys as a substitute for:


1. Making all or part of an indemnity deposit required by Section 15.04.040 if the amount involved equals or exceeds $1,000 and the terms of the escrow authorize the deduction and payment to the City of charges identified in Section 15.04.040; or
2. Filing a surety bond required by Section 15.04.044 if the amount involved is $10,000 or less and, in the event of the applicant's or permittee's default, the authorizing official anticipates that the City could reasonably complete the work needed to protect the public and restore the public place for the amount placed in the escrow account.
3. Interest accruing in the escrow account shall be added to the principal account and the balance after deductions returned to the applicant or permittee.

#### 15.04.044 - Surety bond

1. If required by the authorizing official, the applicant or permittee shall deliver to the Director for filing with the City Clerk or the functional successor, in lieu of or in addition to the indemnity deposit, a sufficient surety bond executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the State of Washington and is approved as to surety and as to form by the City Attorney. The bond shall: assume all the requirements provided in Section 15.04.060 in relation to an indemnity deposit; run for the full period of the permit; be in an amount fixed by the authorizing official; be conditioned that the permittee shall comply with all the terms of the permit and all the provisions of Title 15 and all other ordinances of the City; and to the extent permitted by RCW Chapter 19.72, indemnify and save the City harmless from any and all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense, or damages of every kind and description, excepting only damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City and that may accrue to, be asserted by, or be suffered by, any person or property, including without limitation, damage or injury to the permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenant's invitees, or licensees, by reason of the use of any public place, as provided for in the application.
2. If the application proposes to construct, reconstruct, repair, maintain, or remove any pavement, sewer, water main, storm drain, grading, street lighting, or appurtenance in the public place, the applicant shall file with the Director of Finance and Administrative Services or the functional successor: a sufficient surety bond executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the State of Washington and is approved as to surety and as to form by the City Attorney. The bond shall: be in an amount fixed by the authorizing official; be conditioned that the permittee shall complete all portions of the work according to the City's Standard Plans and Specifications and the special plans approved by the authorizing official; and be conditioned that the permittee shall comply with all the terms of the permit and all the provisions of Title 15 and all other ordinances of the City; and to the extent permitted by RCW Chapter 19.72, indemnify and save the City harmless from any and all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense, or damages of every kind and description, excepting only damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City, that may accrue to, be asserted by, or be suffered by, any person or property, including without limitation, damage or injury to the permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenant's invitees, or licensees, by reason of the use of any public place, as provided for in the application. The bond shall run for the full period of the permit plus one year after City acceptance of the permitted work.
3. If a permittee is periodically using public places, the authorizing official may require the permittee to post a surety bond in an amount the authorizing official deems sufficient to cover the accumulated cost or risk involved at any certain time in a calendar year for the number of permits outstanding. The bond shall be in force during the period of all outstanding permits, but in no case for less than one year. The bond shall be executed by a surety company authorized and qualified to do business in the State of Washington and is subject to approval by the City Attorney as to surety and form. The bond shall require as conditions that the permittee shall: complete all portions of the work according to the City's Standard Plans and Specifications and the special plans approved by the authorizing official; comply with all the terms of the permit and all the provisions of Title 15 and all other ordinances of the City; and to the extent permitted by RCW Chapter 19.72, indemnify and save the City harmless from any and all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense, or damages of every kind and description, excepting only damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City, that may accrue to, be asserted by, or be suffered by, any person or property, including without limitation, damage or injury to the permittee, its officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenant's invitees, or licensees, by reason of the use of any public place, as provided for in the application.
4. If at any time an applicant or permittee applies for a permit to use a public place or to modify an issued permit; the authorizing official, in consultation with the City Risk Manager, may adjust the aggregate amount of bonds needed for the additional work or risk involved in the proposed use; together with that involved under other permits outstanding to the applicant or permittee, exceed the amount of the then posted surety bond; the authorizing official may require the applicant or permittee, prior to issuing the permit; to post an additional or separate surety bond in an amount the authorizing official, in consultation with the City Risk Manager, deems sufficient to cover the additional risk or work involved. The bond shall remain in force during the period of all outstanding permits, but in no case for less than one year from and after the date of the permit. Also, the authorizing official may require any permittee to post a surety bond in the calendar year following the period of a permit when the extent of possible damage to a public place has not been completely determined.
5. Registered side-sewer contractors who post a one-year bond under the provisions of subsection 15.04.044.C or 15.04.044.D shall not be required to post an additional surety bond specifically covering work under separate side-sewer ordinances, including but not limited to Chapter 21.16. An authorizing official may waive the requirement of surety bond under subsection 15.04.044.C upon finding that the bond posted under subsection 21.16.060.C is adequate to fully protect the City. The surety bond shall contain all the requirements of side-sewer ordinances in the same manner as required bonds posted according to the side-sewer ordinances and subsection 21.16.060.C.
6. Sections 15.02.027 and 15.04.017 may apply when constitutional freedoms or statutory rights are exercised.

#### 15.04.045 - Liability insurance

A permittee shall obtain and maintain in full force and effect, at its own expense, public liability insurance in an amount sufficient to protect the City from all potential claims and risks of loss from perils in connection with any activity that may arise from or be related to the permittee's activity upon or the use or occupation of the public place allowed by the permit and claims and risks in connection with activities performed by the permittee by virtue of the permission granted by the permit. The insurance policy shall: be in effect for the duration of the permit; name the "City of Seattle, its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees, and agents" as additional insureds for primary and non-contributory limits of liability subject to a Separation of Insureds clause; apply as primary insurance regardless of any insurance that the City may carry; and obligate the insurance company to give notice to both the authorizing official and the City's Risk Manager at least 30-calendar days before any cancellation of the policy. The authorizing official, in consultation with the City Risk Manager, shall establish the amount of the insurance, subject to review or reconsideration according to Section 15.04.112; and unless constitutional liberties prohibit it, shall require that the insurance be provided prior to issuance of the permit. The City requires insurance coverage to be placed with an insurer admitted and licensed to conduct business in Washington State or with a surplus lines carrier according to RCW Chapter 48.15, except that if it is infeasible to obtain coverage with the required insurer, the City may approve an alternative insurer.


#### 15.04.050 - Account or bond for multiple permits

In the alternative to making an indemnity deposit for each permit under Section 15.04.040, an applicant or permittee, who anticipates applying for two or more permits may, upon the approval of the Director of Transportation, establish with the City a subaccount. This subaccount is created by depositing with the Director of Finance and Administrative Services, to the credit of the Guaranty Deposit Fund, a minimum sum of $500 or the amount fixed for the permit being sought, whichever is greater. On notice from the City, the applicant or permittee shall replenish this sum from time to time, whenever the subaccount balance is reduced to $300 or less.


#### 15.04.060 - Indemnity agreements and covenants

All agreements shall be a covenant running with the land.


1. The permittee shall agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City of Seattle, its officials, officers, employees, and agents from and against:

3. If the application is for a permit to construct and maintain an areaway; the agreement shall also contain a covenant on the part of the permittee executing the agreement, for themselves and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, assigns, lessees, sublessees, tenants and subtenants; assuming the duty of inspecting and maintaining all services, instrumentalities, and facilities installed in the areaway to be constructed or occupied under authority of the permit; and assuming all liability for; and at all times defending, indemnifying, and holding harmless the City, its officials, officers, employees, and agents from and against all claims, actions, suits, liability, loss, costs, expense, attorneys' fees, or damages of every kind and description, excepting only damages that may result from the sole negligence of the City; that may accrue to, be asserted by, or be suffered by any person or property; including without limitation, damage, death, or injury to members of the public or to the permittee's officers, agents, employees, contractors, invitees, tenants and tenants' invitees, licensees or its successors and assigns; arising out of or by reason of:

4. In addition, the agreement shall contain a provision that the permit:

    1. Is wholly of a temporary nature;
    2. Vests no permanent right whatsoever;
    3. May be revoked, the structures and obstructions removed, and public place restored to the condition that existed prior to use occurring in the public place upon 30-calendar days notice, posted on the premises, or published in the official newspaper of the City; or without notice, if the permitted use is dangerous or the structures is insecure or unsafe, or is not constructed, maintained, or used in accordance with the provisions of Title 15.
5. An agreement after it has been received and recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections, shall be retained by the City Clerk in the files and records of the Clerk's office.

#### 15.28.030 - Application for permit.

Every application for a permit to move a building or equipment which requires relocation of utility wires or cable through or across a public place of the City shall be made to the Director of Transportation on a form provided by the Director. Every such application shall state the location of the building to be moved, its dimensions and principal materials, and shall describe the route over which the building is to be moved, the length of time that will be required to move it, and the proposed new location thereof. Before any permit to move a building to a site within the City is issued, specific written approval must be obtained from the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections. The concurrence of the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation is necessary if the building or such equipment will be moved along or across a park drive or boulevard; and the approval of all utilities is also necessary, if those utilities are to be disturbed.

#### 15.28.050 - Wires and cables—Relocation and costs; trees in boulevards or parks.

A person who maintains wires, cable or appurtenances in or over a public place shall move or disconnect them in order to accommodate a move authorized by permit as contemplated by Section 15.32.110. When the wires are below minimum vertical clearances above the roadway surface set by state statute, City ordinance, or rules of the authorizing official, and timely notice has been given, and no adjustment or disconnection would be necessary had the minimum vertical clearance been maintained, the cost of moving the wires or cables shall be borne by the person maintaining the wires or cables; otherwise the cost shall be assessed to the grantee of the permit to move the building or equipment.

The Director of Transportation shall determine the probable injury and cost which the moving of a building or equipment will cause to owners of wires and cables that are at or above minimum vertical clearances over the surface of the public place, and also the probable injury and inconvenience the severance of such wires and cables will cause to patrons of public utilities. The Superintendent shall determine the probable injury and cost of restoration or loss which the moving of a building or equipment along or across a park drive or boulevard or a street abutting a park will cause to the department's trees and shrubbery. Such findings shall be endorsed upon the application for permit.


#### 15.28.060 - Determination of probable interference.

1. Investigation. The Director of Transportation shall ascertain the probable interference with the rights of the public that such moving will cause, and any other facts which may aid in determining whether or not such permit should be granted. The Director of Transportation shall also prescribe the time such moving shall be done, the route to be followed and such traffic barricades and escorts and any other stipulations such official may deem necessary for public safety and convenience. The determinations of the Director shall be subject to the concurrence of the Superintendent with respect to movement along or across a park drive or boulevard.
2. Opportunity for Hearing. If the Director of Transportation finds the injury and inconvenience to the public, to owners of private property, and to public utilities is minor, or that the affected parties consent to the move, and the Superintendent concurs in authorizing the movement planned along or across a park drive or boulevard, the Director may grant the permit without a hearing. If the Director of Transportation finds that there would be substantial injury or inconvenience to the public, to public utilities or to owners of private property and there are unresolved objections to the move, the Director shall notify the applicant that the permit may only be granted through a public hearing process; and, if the applicant so requests, the Director shall designate a hearing officer and schedule a hearing.
3. Hearings. If a hearing is scheduled, the Director shall notify the applicant and the owners or agents of the properties that may be affected of the date, time, and place of the public hearing regarding such application. At this hearing, all persons interested may appear and offer their opinion regarding whether or not such permit should be granted.
4. Cost of Advertising. Whenever the Director of Transportation determines that a public hearing must be held to determine whether or not a permit to move a building or equipment should be granted, the applicant shall pay the cost to the City for advertising the hearing.
5. Decision. Based upon the findings of the hearing officer with respect to such application and the testimony received during the public hearing on such application, the Director shall determine whether or not such permit shall be granted.

#### 15.28.070 - Grantee to bear expenses.

The grantee of a permit to move a building or equipment which requires relocating utility wires or cable along or across any public place shall bear any and all expenses to the Parks, Seattle Transportation and Police Departments that may be occasioned by such moving; provided, that nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as repealing any of the provisions of any franchise ordinance.


#### 15.28.080 - Authority to make rules and regulations.

The Director of Transportation may make rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Code of the City (Ordinance 102228) and governing the moving of buildings along or across public places. Violation of those rules and regulations constitutes a violation of this subtitle.

    1. For any concrete surface 15 years old or less or in excellent condition as determined by the Director of Transportation, entire replacement of any concrete panel affected by the construction or other activity shall be required, except that in the case of a large concrete panel, the Director of Transportation may authorize the panel to be saw cut and require only the affected portion of the panel be replaced.
    2. For any concrete surface where 40 percent or more of a concrete panel is affected by the construction or other activity, entire replacement of any concrete panel affected by the construction or other activity is required, except that in the case of a large concrete panel, the Director of Transportation may authorize the panel to be saw cut and require only the affected portion of the panel be replaced.
    3. For any other concrete surface, restoration of the area of the panel affected is required.

2. Existing communication cabinets and accessory equipment may remain in use, or be upgraded or repaired, subject to the provisions of Chapter 15.32 and any other applicable code and rule.
3. Communication cabinets shall, when possible; be sited using the fewest and smallest cabinets and equipment available that satisfy the service objectives of the site or project, and in locations that reduce the visual impact of the cabinets and the overall project. Examples include siting the cabinet behind the sidewalk edge that is furthest from the street or in unimproved public places as opposed to locating a cabinet in a planting strip. Cabinets shall, when possible, be painted a color that blends the cabinet into its surroundings.
4. Communication cabinets mounted to street light or utility poles are subject to the applicable provisions in Section 15.32.300 and Seattle City Light Standards for pole attachments.
5. Applicants for new at-grade communication cabinet installations that are proposed to be located in the public place abutting any zone and that are more than 36 inches in height including footings or bases as measured from the grade of the surrounding public place, or that have a maximum volume of more than 18 cubic feet, shall demonstrate the following in writing before a Street Use permit to occupy the public place may be issued:

    1. A private property easement could not be obtained for the communication cabinet installation or verification that this type of use is not authorized within the zoning of the private property; and

    3. The communication cabinet could not be attached to a street light or utility pole, according to the applicable requirements of Section 15.32.300 and Seattle City Light standards.
    4. The Director of Transportation may waive the requirements of this subsection 15.32.200.E if the proposed project deploys enhanced communication service that provides a new service or upgrades a similar service currently provided in the proposed project area and the proposed at-grade project design, in the Director's judgment, minimizes the visual impacts to the public place and results in significantly fewer cabinet installations in the project area.
6. The applicant for a new at-grade communication cabinet proposal that is more than 36 inches in height including footings or bases as measured from the grade of the surrounding public place, or has a maximum volume of more than 18 cubic feet, shall: (1) send notice of an SDOT application by first-class mail to all business entities, property owners, and residents located within a 100-foot radius from where the communication cabinet is proposed to be located; and (2) post notice of the new application at the proposed site. The notice shall be displayed towards the nearest public place that abuts the site and is viewable by the public, and shall be maintained on the site for the duration of the public notice period.

    1. If the new at-grade communication cabinet proposal; is more than 36 inches in height including footings or bases as measured from the grade of the surrounding public place, or has a maximum volume of more than 18 cubic feet, and is abutting a lot zoned RSL, SF 5000, SF 7200, SF 9600, LR1, LR2, or LR3 as these zoning designations are defined under subsection 23.30.010.A and the abutting zoning does not have an RC designation as shown on the Official Land Use Map, Chapter 23.32 ("residentially-zoned parcels"); the communication cabinet shall be fully screened from the public place and abutting private property. If it is not feasible to install mitigation screening due to physical site constraints, the applicant shall provide an alternative mitigation proposal within 200 feet of the project. If the alternative mitigation cannot be located within 200 feet of the project, the applicant shall propose an alternative location that the Director shall review and may approve. All mitigation screening shall comply with setback standards in Section 15.32.225, and remain the permittee's sole responsibility to maintain so long as the communication cabinet or accessory equipment occupy the public place. As determined by the Director, mitigation screening may include landscaping, fencing, or visual treatment to the cabinet surface. Visual treatment to the cabinet may include paint, decals, vinyl wraps, photos, or other surface treatments. A cabinet shall be considered fully screened for visual treatment purposes when the treatment is applied to all communication cabinet vertical surfaces.
    2. The applicant shall send and post all required notices at least three-calendar days before the start of the public notice period. The mailing and on-site notice shall be on a form provided by the Department of Transportation and shall include: a description of the proposed location and installations, comment period dates, information on how the public can submit comments to SDOT, and how to request a reconsideration of a Street Use permit decision.

#### 15.32.300 - Attachments to City-owned poles.

The terms and conditions for attaching to City-owned poles by entities other than co-owners of the poles shall be as follows:


1. Definitions. The following words, used in this section, have the following meanings:

    1. "Pole" means City-owned poles including electrical distribution poles and other poles owned or installed by the City, but excluding facilities for electrical transmission purposes.
    2. "Communication space" means that portion of a pole above the minimum ground clearance for communication conductors and below the maximum height allowed by the separation between communication and power conductors required by applicable national, state and local electrical safety codes.
    3. "Transmission poles/towers" means structures whose primary purpose is to support electrical transmission conductors, distinguished from distribution conductors by exceeding 34.5 kV.
    4. "Special attachment, Class I" means attachments that can be accommodated on existing poles without disruption to current users or use of a communication space and without significant visual impact.
    5. "Special attachment, Class II" means attachments:

        1. That extend above the electrical facilities, above the top of an existing pole or require the replacement of an existing pole with a taller pole to achieve adequate height for the applicant's purposes; or
        2. That have significant visual impacts.
2. The City shall reserve one (1) communication space on City-owned poles for its own use.
3. If additional communication space is available on City-owned poles, after reserving one space for the City and after accounting for the space occupied by existing services already on the poles, the City may permit additional attachments in communication space under the following conditions:

    1. The needs of the City are paramount. The City shall be the determinant regarding any question of right to attach, construction compliance or contract interpretation regarding attachment to poles. Permission to make attachments to the City's poles may be withdrawn for violation of applicable codes, for breach of contract, for failure to supply proof of required permits, by governmental directive or for any reason associated with the City's requirements for the use of its poles or public right-of-way. The City may direct the immediate removal of attachments at the owner's expense, if attachments fail to conform to codes or the City's requirements, or if attachments interfere with City operations.
    2. All attachments shall be made in accordance with all applicable codes as well as City electrical standards, guidelines and practices.
    3. All attachments, including co-lashing, shall be subject to prior approval of the Seattle Information Technology Department, Seattle Department of Transportation and the City Light Department in accordance with the following principles, requirements and procedures:

        1. Providing for the safety of the public, City employees, private contractors, and other users of poles is a fundamental principle which must be observed.
        2. The primary function of the City's poles is to support the City's electrical lines and equipment.
        3. The City shall neither replace existing poles with taller poles nor add crossarms to existing poles to create more communication space on the poles, except as described in subsection 15.32.300.C.4 below.
        4. Any new attachments must accommodate any prior agreements between the City and other entities regarding use of space on the poles.
        5. The City shall not relinquish the one communication space reserved for its own use on every pole. At the request of the applicant, however, the City shall consider creating additional space for communication uses on the poles by taking such actions as removing secondary rack wiring and substituting triplex wire, moving streetlight fixtures, guy wires and other attachments to the poles and by providing for co-lashing. Any actions undertaken to create more communication space shall be considered make-ready work, and any such costs shall be borne by the applicant.
        6. Approval of attachments may include requirements for extra mitigation measures in certain areas, such as residential, critical areas and shoreline zones, greenbelts, parks, historic districts and viewsheds. All such extra measures, including any additional public involvement and/or environmental review, shall be taken in accordance with directives from the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer of the City Light Department, and all costs associated with such extra measures and review shall be paid by the applicant.
        7. All make-ready costs such as costs for any permits, environmental review, adjustment of other equipment on the pole, tree replacement and tree trimming, shall be paid by the applicant prior to making any attachments to the poles.
        8. As a condition of securing the City's permission to use its poles for attachment of cable, all applicants shall be required to permit co-lashing to their own cable of up to two other cables, which may be owned and operated by other entities. All cable attachments that initially occupy a space on a City-owned pole shall be required to provide an external or internal support ("messenger") wire that is capable of supporting two other cables in addition to the initial cable installed by the applicant. Owners of cable subsequently co-lashed to the initial cable shall pay the owner of the initial cable a proportionate share of the cost of the messenger wire. All entities co-lashing together shall be required to provide one another with reciprocal indemnity provisions equivalent to those which must be granted to the City by each of them pursuant to Section 15.32.150. Co-lashing shall not be required of any applicant until all other spaces on the pole, other than the City's reserved space, have been utilized. The City Light Department shall issue a Department Policy and Procedure for providing co-lashing space based on costs, operational convenience, cable size, and other criteria which are developed in the course of producing such Department Policy and Procedure.
        9. In addition to the indemnification required by Section 15.32.150, the City may require that the applicant provide the City and entities permitted to co-lash with additional indemnification, such as indemnification from a parent company, and/or require that the applicant provide proof of specific insurance provisions acceptable to the City which cover potential exposure of both the applicant and the City.
        10. As a further condition of securing the City's permission to use its poles for attachment of cable, all applicants upon request shall be required to provide the City with capacity on the applicant's cable over and above the capacity specifications submitted by the applicant. Such additional capacity may be in the form of dedicated fiber or dedicated space on the same cable being installed by the applicant or in the form of separate cable, as specified by the Seattle Information Technology Department, and shall be dedicated to the City for as long as the cable is attached to the City's poles. The City shall have the right to use that capacity for any governmental purpose and the right to lease that capacity to any public or nonprofit entities. The incremental costs of adding the specified amount of capacity for the City shall be borne by the City.
        11. Applications for attachment to City-owned poles shall be submitted to the City Light Department. The City Light Department shall then coordinate that request with the Seattle Department of Transportation and the Seattle Information Technology Department. Approval of all three departments shall be required prior to the issuance of a permit to attach to the poles.
        12. All applications for pole attachment shall be considered on a first-come, first-serve basis, provided that where space is limited, attachment permits shall be given first to public entities, second to entities which are common carriers, third to entities which request attachment to six poles or less for their own private communication needs, and fourth to others.
        13. If no space can be created on the poles requested, the applicant may seek an exception to any of the requirements set forth in this section by submitting a written request to a three person review committee comprised of one representative each from the Seattle Information Technology Department, the Seattle Department of Transportation, and the City Light Department. The committee shall review the request with reference to considerations which may warrant making an exception including, but not limited to reduced environmental effects, the lack of alternatives for achieving equivalent service available to the applicant, the lack of alternative routing which can be made available and the feasibility of undergrounding all or part of the cable. After engaging in a review of the application, the committee shall forward a recommendation to the Mayor and City Council. Exceptions will not be recommended where the City Light Department believes the safety will be compromised by the granting of an exception. Any exceptions to the requirements of this Section 15.32.300 must be approved by ordinance.
        14. All entities that are provided attachments to City-owned poles, other than Class II attachments, including attachments by means of co-lashing, shall pay a rental fee for each such attachment at a rate established by ordinance. All income from such pole rental rates shall be paid into the Light Fund.
    4. Provisions for special attachments

        1. Class II attachments shall be limited to situations where: (i) make-ready costs are paid by the provider; (ii) pole/equipment, installation, operation, and maintenance costs are paid by the provider; and (iii) visual impacts of antennas and other attachments are reduced to a degree acceptable to the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer.
        2. Class II attachment requests are subject to public notice and comment. Approval of attachments may include requirements for extra mitigation measures in certain areas, such as residential, critical areas and shoreline zones, greenbelts, parks, historic districts and view-sheds. All such extra measures, including any additional public involvement and/or environmental review, shall be taken in accordance with directives from the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer of the City Light Department, and all costs associated with such extra measures and review shall be paid by the applicant. Where a request meets the following criteria in Seattle, the applicant shall apply to the Department of Planning and Development and pay for an attachment siting review and recommendation consistent with the application, fee, notice, timeline and criteria for an administrative conditional use permit. The recommendation of the Department of Planning and Development shall be advisory to the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer:
        3. Where the request is for a location outside Seattle, the applicant shall comply with all applicable requirements of the local jurisdiction where the property is located.
        4. Class II attachments shall be permitted substantially in the form of the site agreements authorized by Ordinance 118737, together with special terms and conditions within the site agreement.
        5. Class II rental rates shall be established at fair market value as determined by the City Light Department and set forth in the special terms and conditions within the site agreement. All income from such Class II rental rates shall be paid into the Light Fund.

In establishing a deadline for removal, the Director or Superintendent may consider the following factors: (a) the public's use made of the public place and its need for clear access; (b) the time that an owner, proceeding diligently, would need to relocate his or her possessions, including, if services of a commercial transportation company are needed, whether arrangements therefor are in process; (c) the impact of allowing the accumulation on the sidewalk or planting strip to continue, including the risk of accident, the attraction to vermin, and its appearance; (d) weather conditions; and, (e) if applicable, the risk that if prompt action is not taken, removal may ultimately become more burdensome to the City.
3. Notice to Remove. The authorizing official shall provide written notice to the owner or custodian at his or her address, if known; if the owner or custodian or either's address is not known, or the owner or custodian is not available at the site, the authorizing official may post notice to remove property on the sidewalk or planting strip. The notice shall direct the owner or custodian to remove his or her property, set a time for completion of removal; and inform the owner that if the property is not so removed, the City will take possession and remove the same at the owner's or custodian's costs and expense.
4. Warnings. The authorizing official may require the owner to place safe and adequate guidance to pedestrian and vehicular traffic moving past the site as contemplated by Chapter 15.40.
5. Impounding and/or Disposition. Upon expiration of the deadline for removal, the authorizing official may impound the property remaining in the public place; and as to those items within the criteria of Section 15.38.040, make summary disposition and as to the remainder, make disposition in accordance with Section 15.38.040.

#### 15.38.070 - Presumption.

Personal property in a public place is presumed to be abandoned by the owner or custodian so as to permit an authorizing official to take custody whenever:


1. The property is placed out for collection in conjunction with solid waste or recyclable material on the scheduled date for City collection, or it is placed there on a date contemporaneous with a community collection or clean-up;
2. A reasonable person would not allow the property to be there unattended for the length of time the property has been there, taking into account the location of the property in the sidewalk or roadway, the type of property, the danger of theft, and the risk of damage from weather;
3. No name appears on the property and the occupant or owner of the adjacent real property on inquiry disclaims ownership, and there is no permit for such a use of the public place; or
4. The property (other than a newsstand or recreational equipment) is unattended, without a permit, on a sidewalk or planting strip adjoining a park or in a park drive or boulevard.

Whenever the presumption applies, a claimant has the burden of establishing his or her ownership or right to custody in seeking a release of the property impounded.

1. A special event permit or authorization from the Special Events Committee is required for any special event, as defined in this Chapter 15.52. Such special event permit or authorization shall be in addition to any street or park use permit, parade permit, Seattle Center permit or agreement, or other regular permits as may be required by ordinance.
2. To avoid duplication, when a special event permit covers the subject matter to their satisfaction, the Director of Transportation and/or as to parks, park drives and boulevards, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, respectively, may waive issuing a separate street use permit or park use permit.
3. When a special event permit is required, no street use permit shall issue under this Title 15, nor shall a park use permit issue pursuant to Title 18, for such an event until the Special Events Committee has issued its special event permit therefor or otherwise authorized the issuance of the departmental permits, unless pursuant to subsection 15.52.040.B the Director and/or the Superintendent waive issuance of separate permits.
4. When a special event permit is required, the Special Events Committee shall, after reviewing the application and if necessary meeting with the organizer, advise the organizer of all other permits that appear to be required for the event based on information contained in the application, assisting the organizer in contacting other departments to apply for all other permits in a timely manner.
5. When such an event will be a free speech event or mixed free speech event, the application shall be processed promptly.

#### 15.52.050 - Conditions authorized

The Special Events Committee may include in a special event permit, among other provisions, reasonable terms or conditions as to the time, place, and manner of the event as is necessary to coordinate multiple uses of public property, assure preservation of public property and public places, prevent dangerous, unlawful, or impermissible uses, protect the safety of persons and property and control vehicular and pedestrian traffic in and around the venue, and protect and insure the safety, comfort, or convenience of the public, provided that such requirements shall not be imposed in a manner that will unreasonably restrict expressive or other activity protected by the Washington or United States Constitutions. Such terms and conditions may include the implementation of a plan presented by the applicant and approved by the Committee for:


1. crowd control, traffic control, safety, and security;
2. compliance with health and sanitary regulations as explicated by the Seattle-King County Health Department for the event;
3. compliance with any applicable law, rule, or regulation pertaining to the preservation or promotion of public health, safety or welfare;
4. coordination with the Fire Department or medical personnel for emergency treatment and evacuation of people who may need immediate care, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, or ambulance service;
5. emergency communication, fire suppression equipment with structures, and maintenance of unobstructed emergency passageways;
6. proper waste, recycling, and compost receptacles and a disposal plan as explicated by Seattle Public Utilities, as well as a clean-up plan; and,
7. where traffic congestion is anticipated, encouraging the use of alternative transportation choices such as transit, biking, and car pooling.
In determining and issuing conditions, the Special Events Committee shall consider anticipated impacts of the event based on an assessment of the event, including size, scope, complexity, location, and history; the event's or event organizer's successful implementation of conditions included in previous permits; the public's access to public places and public services; the impact on frequently-utilized special event locations or routes; and the impact on neighborhoods. Conditions shall not be determined or issued based on the programming content of the event or message that the proposed event may convey.

In order to accommodate other concurrent events, the rights of abutting owners, the needs of the public to use streets, parks, or other public services, and to minimize impact on frequently-utilized special event locations or routes, the conditions may include, but are not limited to, reasonable adjustments in the date, time, route, or location of the proposed event; accommodations of pedestrian or vehicular traffic using the street; and limitations on the duration of the event, recognizing the conditions or adjustments may affect the total fees.


#### 15.52.060 - Processing, denial, and revocation of permit

Organizers of free speech events as defined in Section 15.52.005, including, but not limited to, spontaneous free speech events that are occasioned by news or affairs coming into public knowledge, may submit their applications at any time before the scheduled event.

For all special events other than free speech events and mixed free speech events, payment of a late fee, as described in subsection 15.52.070.E, may be required if the application is submitted less than 60 days prior to the start of the event. The Special Events Committee may waive the late fee based on the time necessary to plan, process, and permit the event; the size, scope, complexity, location, or history of the event; and the event organizer's experience in organizing events.

In the event subsection 2, 3, or 4 of this subsection 15.52.060.B applies, the Special Events Committee shall offer the applicant the opportunity to submit an alternative date or place for the proposed event before denying the application. For free speech and mixed free speech events, the City shall designate an alternative proposal and may impose conditions pursuant to Section 15.52.050.

If the Special Events Committee denies an application, the Committee shall state in writing the reasons for its denial.


1. Processing. To assist the City in planning for and assigning its police, fire, and other department personnel, the organizers of special events, except free speech events as defined in Section 15.52.005, subject to a special event permit are required to submit their applications at least 90 days before the scheduled event; and the Special Events Committee shall process such application within 60 days of the application, if practicable. If the application is received less than 90 days in advance, the Special Events Committee shall process the application if, taking into consideration the City resources available, the type, size, scope, complexity, location, or history of the event, the application is received with sufficient time to plan and permit the event.
2. Denial. The Special Events Committee may deny an application for a special event permit if:

    1. The applicant supplies false or misleading information; the applicant fails to complete the application or to supply other required information or documents; or the applicant declares or shows an unwillingness or inability to comply with reasonable terms or conditions contained in the proposed permit;
    2. The time necessary to plan, process, and permit the event is insufficient based on the size, scope, complexity, location, or history of the event, and the resources available to the City, except that nothing in this subsection 15.52.060.B.2 shall limit an applicant's ability to obtain a last-minute parade permit pursuant to Section 11.25.050.E. Applications for spontaneous free speech events that are occasioned by news or affairs coming into public knowledge less than one week before such events shall not be denied with respect to the date of the proposed event based on this subsection 15.52.060.B.2;
    3. The proposed event is proximate to another previously permitted or previously scheduled event, so that the combined impacts and required public services exceed what the City, after reasonable efforts have been made to accommodate both events, can reasonably provide; or the proposed event would interfere with construction or maintenance work in the immediate vicinity; or
    4. The proposed event would unreasonably disrupt the orderly or safe circulation of traffic; would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety, or present an unreasonable risk of injury, to the public, the participants, or City employees; or would present an unreasonable risk of damage to property.
3. Revocation. The Special Events Committee may cancel or revoke a permit already issued upon written notice to the applicant stating the grounds for revocation if:

    1. The applicant, in the information supplied, has made misstatement of a material fact; the applicant has failed to fulfill a term or condition of the permit in a timely manner; or the check submitted by an applicant in payment of the fee for a permit has been dishonored; or
    2. The applicant requests the cancellation of the permit or cancels the event; or
    3. An emergency or supervening occurrence requires the cancellation or termination of the event in order to protect the public health or safety.
4. Administrative Review. An applicant may request an administrative review of: a Special Events Committee denial of a special events permit application, or conditions placed upon a permit that the applicant alleges are unconstitutional or will prevent the applicant from holding the proposed event. Such a review shall be conducted by an Administrative Review Committee, comprised of the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation if the event will impact a park, the Director of Seattle Center if the event will impact the Seattle Center area, the Director of Transportation, the Fire Chief, the Chief of Police, and the Director of the Office of Economic Development, or their deputies, provided that if the deputy is a member of the Special Events Committee, then the department head shall serve on the Administrative Review Committee. A request for an administrative review shall be made to the Special Events Committee in writing within three business days after the denial or issuance of the permit with conditions. The Administrative Review Committee shall issue its review within five business days of its receipt of the request for review.

#### 15.52.070 - Fees

![15-52-070.png](./images/15-52-070.png)


Exhibit A for


1. Street/Bridge Use. To determine the type of street segment, the most current SDOT Planned Arterial Classifications Map, which reflects the legal street classification as described in Section 15.60.015, shall be used. In calculating this fee component, the following shall be reflected:

    1. Street segments in the downtown core are counted as principal arterials regardless of the actual street classification.
    2. The fee per hour is charged, rounded up to the nearest ½ hour, based on the amount of time the street is planned to be closed or modified to traffic.
    3. Hours between the time of 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. are not included in the count if the event is 30 hours or longer.
2. Arterials Intersected. This component of the fee is calculated by multiplying the number of additional arterial intersections closed or modified by the number of hours it is closed or modified to traffic and/or the general public by the applicable fee per hour. To determine the type of arterial intersected, the most current SDOT Planned Arterial Classifications Map, which reflects the legal street classification as described in Section 15.60.015, shall be used. In calculating this fee component:

    1. Those items identified in subsections 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c of this subsection 15.52.070.B shall be taken into account.
    2. Intersections shall only be counted if the closed or occupied streets will block a full arterial intersection; if half the intersected street is an arterial and the other half is an access street, it is not included in the count.
    3. If the closed street intersects a street with one type of arterial on one side and a different type of arterial on the other side, the lower level arterial is utilized for the count.
    4. An arterial is considered intersected if normal traffic operations and conditions cannot be executed. An intersection that continues to allow traffic and transit to flow but requires them to wait longer than would be typically expected is included in the count.
3. Prior Year Discount. If the event is a repeat event taking place in the same general time, place, and manner as the most recent event, which must have taken place at least once within the previous two calendar years, the prior year discount applies. A discount of 25 percent is applied to the total components of subsections 1 and 2 of this subsection 15.52.070.B.
4. Alcohol Area Fee. For events that will include alcohol sales to the general public or event attendees as permitted by the Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board, a fee per alcohol service area applies to those alcohol areas in a park, other City-owned property, excluding the Seattle Center area, or public place. The fee is $200 for the first alcohol area and $100 for each additional alcohol area.
5. Vendor Fee. For events providing or renting space to vendors selling or promoting products or services, a fee of $20 per vendor applies. The fee only applies to vendors selling or promoting a commercial product or commercial service in a park, other City-owned property excluding the Seattle Center area, or public place. Vendors engaged solely in expressive activity such as leafletting, pamphleting or solicitation, or who are engaged in the sale of goods that are inextricably intertwined with statements carrying a religious, political, philosophical, or ideological message are not included. Other vendors with non-sales-related or non-commercial-related actions are not included.
![15-52-070-B.png](./images/15-52-070-B.png)


Exhibit B for


1. Application Fee. A non-refundable application fee of $75 shall be due upon filing of a special events permit or authorization application for all event types except free speech events and mixed free speech events. The Special Events Committee shall waive the application fee for free speech events and mixed free speech events if the individual applicant qualifies as an indigent natural person as defined in Section 15.52.005. In making its determination, the Special Events Committee may require relevant information and documentation as may, in the opinion of the Special Events Chair, be reasonably necessary to verify the indigent status of the individual.
2. Administrative Fee. For athletic events, commercial events, community events, and parade events, the administrative fee is the sum of five fee components as calculated in Exhibit A for 15.52.070 and described below in this subsection 15.52.070.B. The administrative fee for mixed free speech events shall be the lower of a) the fees as calculated in this subsection 15.52.070.B using the five fee components related solely to non-expressive or commercial activity, at those events or b) the actual costs incurred by the City for planning, review, and permitting before the event; required inspections during the event; a traffic control plan; noise variation permits and reviews; business license reviews; and insurance reviews. The administrative fee shall not be charged for free speech events as defined in Section 15.52.005.
3. Police Department Fee. For athletic events and commercial events, the police department fee applies and is calculated by multiplying the number of officers required to safely manage vehicle or waterway traffic and a reasonable number of officers within the event footprint to ensure safety and security by the number of hours per officer by a rate of $67 per officer per hour as calculated in Exhibit B for 15.52.070. The number of hours per officer are rounded up to the nearest half hour. A two hour minimum per officer applies. Any officers paid for by the organizer through agreements with Parks, the Seattle Center, or other agreements with the Seattle Police Department, are separate and not included as part of this fee. Police department fees shall not be charged for community events, parade events, free speech events, or mixed free speech events as defined in Section 15.52.005.
4. Citywide Event Fee. The citywide event fee is applicable only to citywide events as defined in Section 15.52.005. The chair of the Special Events Committee, in consultation with the Special Events Committee and Seattle Police Department, is hereby authorized to negotiate and finalize an agreement with organizers of citywide events concerning services, resources, fees, and safety and security. The agreement must be supported by the Chief of Police representative on the Special Events Committee and a majority vote of the Special Events Committee. The citywide event fee must delineate an amount for the administrative fee and the police department fee.
5. Late Fees. If late fees are required as determined in subsection 15.52.060.A, the application fee shall be $150 and the administrative fee shall be 120 percent of the administrative fee calculated as if the event's application were submitted on time.
6. Other Fees. Other costs and fees, to be paid in addition to the fees under this Section 15.52.070, include, but are not limited to: Seattle Parks fees (including vendor fees for vendors in parks); Seattle Center fees; utilized emergency management services; Seattle Fire Department and/or Fire Marshal inspection fees; parking meter loss revenue; business licensing fees; penalties; noise variance fees; and post-event cleanup.
7. Fee Adjustments. The hourly rates described in subsections 1 and 2 of subsection 15.52.070.B shall be revised by the Special Events Committee annually based on changes in the purchasing power of the dollar during the preceding year shown by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers for Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton, WA, First Six Months, published in or about August of each year by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics. The first adjustment shall apply in 2018. Adjustments shall use 2017 as the base year but fee components shall not increase by more than ten percent from one year to the next. The Special Events Committee may determine whether to adjust the application fee, vendor fee, alcohol area fee, or police department fee, but it may only do so once per year in conjunction with the administrative fee adjustment and shall not increase by more than ten percent from one year to the next. Without including any phase-in discount, when the police department fee is established for an event for the first time, if an event is a repeat event taking place in the same general time, place, and manner as it did in the previous year, and no documented issues during previous years' events would demand the need for additional officer support, the police department fee for an event shall not increase by more than ten percent from the previous year.
8. When Payable. A fee deposit in the entire amount of the administrative fee and police department fee, as applicable, is due and payable 30 days before the first date of the event unless the Special Events Committee authorized an alternate arrangement. In no circumstance shall the permit be issued without previous deposit of the entire fee. All payments shall be deposited into the City Treasury to the credit of the Treasurer's Clearing Fund; and once the event is complete, the amount due to the City shall be transferred to the General Fund Special Event Revenue Account.
9. Refunds

    1. The event organizer may apply for a refund to the Special Events Committee within 30 days after the original event start date.
    2. The application fee is non-refundable.
    3. If the permit has not been issued, the total fee deposit may be refunded at 100 percent.
    4. If the permit was issued and fee deposit made but the event is cancelled by the Special Events Committee for a reason outside of the event organizer's control, the total fee deposit may be refunded at 100 percent.
    5. If the permit was issued and fee deposit made but the event is cancelled by the event organizer at least three business days before the event start date, the administrative fee may be refunded at 50 percent and the police department fee may be refunded at 100 percent.
    6. If the permit was issued and fee deposit made but the event is cancelled by the event organizer during the three business days before the event start date, the administrative fee shall not be refunded and the police department fee may be refunded at 90 percent.
    7. If the amount of police officers and police officer hours paid for by the event organizer through the police department fee is greater than the number of police officers and police officer hours provided by the Seattle Police Department at the event, the fee amount overpaid by the event organizer shall be refunded at 100 percent.
    8. If the actual costs for a mixed free speech event are less than the amount paid by the applicant, the applicant shall be refunded the excess paid.
10. Phase-In Discount. If a 2016 event will be conducted in the same general time, place, and manner as the 2015 event but would realize a total special events fee increase from 2015 to 2016 if calculated in full as a result of these fee increases, then the total 2016 special events fee, comprised of the administrative fee and police department fee (if applicable), shall be discounted. The discounted special events fee for 2016 shall be equal to: the event's 2015 special events fee plus 50 percent of the total special events fee increase from 2015 to 2016. The phase-in discount applies to all special event types except citywide events. The discount applies to 2016 events only. For 2017 and later, the full special events fee applies to all events.

#### 15.52.080 - Exemptions from fees

No fee shall be imposed under this Chapter 15.52 on events that are authorized by a special ordinance that sets out fees or charges for that particular event.


#### 15.52.090 - Exclusions

This Chapter 15.52 does not apply to:


1. Events occurring solely in the Seattle Center area; or
2. Events occurring solely in stadiums or other venues managed by Transportation Management Plans that are submitted separately to the City, including, but not limited to, events at Century Link Field and Event Center, Husky Stadium, Key Arena, and Safeco Field; or
3. Events under the authority of the United States; or
4. Events using parks or public places as a result of or preparation for a fire, earthquake, or other disaster, or practices or exercises for disaster management.

#### 15.52.100 - Audit requested

The City Council requests the Seattle City Auditor to audit the Seattle Police Department's process for staffing special events. This audit should include the planning, authorization, staffing levels, attendance, and payment of officers for permitted special events under Chapter 15.52. The City Council requests that the first audit take place in the first quarter of 2016 and cover special events staffing for 2010 through 2015. The City Budget Office shall utilize the audit's results and recommendations to perform subsequent annual reviews to take place in the first quarter of each year and cover special events staffing for the previous year. The final review will take place in 2020 unless City Council directs otherwise.

#### 15.54.010 - Definitions.

The terms "city transportation authority," "monorail guideway," "monorail transit facility," "monorail transit station," and "monorail transit system" shall have the same meanings as the definitions of those terms in Chapter 23.84A.

1. Any city transportation authority desiring to construct a monorail guideway in City right-of-way or city transportation authority right-of-way (even where such rights-of-way may consist only of aerial easements) shall obtain the approval of the Director of Transportation of final construction plans before commencing any such work. In exercising his or her authority under this chapter, the Director of Transportation shall follow applicable procedures in this title and not procedures in Chapter 23.76.
2. The Director of Transportation may approve a monorail guideway only if the horizontal and vertical alignment of the monorail guideway has been approved by the City Council by ordinance or resolution.
3. Where necessary to achieve consistency with the terms of the City Council's approval of the monorail transit system, the Director of Transportation may waive or modify development standards pursuant to Title 23, including but not limited to, height, setbacks, yards, landscaping, or lot coverage. In addition, to promote consistency with any monorail transit system-specific design guidelines to be developed by the City and a city transportation authority and approved by the City Council by ordinance, development standards other than height may be waived or modified.
4. The Director of Transportation may impose reasonable conditions:

    1. Where necessary to achieve consistency with the terms of the City Council's approval of the monorail transit system; or
    2. Pursuant to Chapter 25.05 to lessen identified impacts caused by the monorail transit facilities; or
    3. To ensure consistency with any monorail transit system-specific design guidelines to be developed by the City and a city transportation authority and approved by the City Council by ordinance.

### Chapter 15.62 - VACATION OF STREETS, ALLEYS AND PUBLIC PLACES

Sections:

#### 15.62.010 - Statement of purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures, notice requirements and fees for the vacation of streets, alleys and public places within the City. This chapter is intended to implement the authority granted to the City by RCW Chapter 35.79 and to conform to its provisions, and in case of conflict between this chapter and that statute, it is intended that the statutory provisions shall be controlling.


#### 15.62.020 - Petition for vacation.

The owners of an interest in any real estate abutting upon any street, alley or public place who may desire to vacate the street, alley or public place or any part thereof may petition the City Council to make vacation, giving a description of the property to be vacated, or the City Council may itself initiate such vacation procedure by resolution. The petition or resolution shall be filed with the City Clerk, and if the petition is signed by the owners of more than two-thirds () of the property abutting upon the part of such street or alley sought to be vacated, the City Council shall by resolution fix a time when the petition will be heard and determined by such authority or a committee thereof, which time shall be not more than sixty (60) days nor less than twenty (20) days after the date of the passage of such resolution.


#### 15.62.030 - Petition fees.

Every petition for the vacation of any street, alley or public place, or any part thereof, shall be accompanied by an initial payment to the City of a pre-hearing fee of Four Hundred Fifty Dollars ($450.00) to defray a portion of the administrative costs incurred in processing such vacation petitions. Subsequent fees for post-hearing activities shall be One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00) for single-family residential zoned land, and Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) for all other street vacation petitions. Such fees shall not be refunded under any circumstances. In addition, at the time the City Council, or a committee thereof, recommends granting a vacation petition for single-family residential zoned land, the petitioner shall deposit Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00) with the Director of Transportation to be applied to the cost of an appraisal. If the land is zoned other than single-family residential or multiple parcels of land are involved in the vacation, the petitioner shall deposit an amount determined by the Director of Transportation to be the Director's best estimate of the cost of an appraisal of the land. In the event an appraisal cost is less than the amount deposited, the vacation compensation payable to the City shall be reduced by the difference between the deposit and the actual cost or, in the alternative, such difference shall be refunded. In the event an appraisal cost is more than the amount deposited, the vacation compensation payable to the City shall be increased by the difference between the deposit and the actual cost, or, in the alternative, such difference shall be separately billed and paid prior to final approval of the vacation.


#### 15.62.040 - Notice of hearing.

Upon the passage of the resolution fixing the time for hearing the petition or proposal for vacation, the City Clerk shall give not less than 20 days' notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing by written notice posted in three of the most public places in the City and by posting written placards in conspicuous places on and near the street, alley or public place sought to be vacated. Placards shall be highly visible and at least 11 inches by 14 inches in size, with headings that can be read from a distance of 75 feet by persons of normal visual acuity, and shall include a map showing the location of the street, alley, or public place proposed to be vacated. In addition to posting notices of the hearing, the City Clerk shall mail a copy of the notice containing a statement of the time and place fixed for the hearing to:


1. All owners, commercial lessees and residents of property which lies within 300 feet of the street, alley or public place proposed to be vacated, provided that when a street, alley or public place is proposed to be vacated in the area bounded by Denny Way, the Central Freeway, South Royal Brougham Way and Elliott Bay, notices shall be mailed only to property owners and building managers. For such purpose the real property tax roll as issued annually on microfiche by the County Comptroller and the addresses listed in the latest edition of Polk's Directory or its successor publications shall be used;
2. The Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections for inclusion in an informational mailing to newspapers, individuals and groups on a master mailing list established pursuant to the Master Use Permit Ordinance (Chapter 23.76).

#### 15.62.050 - Protest.

If fifty percent (50%) of the abutting property owners file written objections to a Council-initiated vacation with the City Clerk prior to the time of the hearing, the City shall be prohibited from proceeding with the resolution.


#### 15.62.060 - Hearing.

The hearing on such petition or proposal shall be held before the City Council, or before a committee thereof upon the day fixed by resolution or at the time to which said hearing may be adjourned. If the hearing is before such a committee, the same shall, following the hearing, report its recommendation on the petition or proposal to the City Council which may adopt or reject the recommendation.

The City Council may grant the petition with or without conditions, or may deny the petition.


#### 15.62.070 - Easements for utilities and services.

Ordinances vacating streets, alleys or public places may contain a provision retaining or requiring conveyance of easements for construction, repair and maintenance of existing and future public utilities and services.


#### 15.62.080 - Vacation of waterfront streets.

1. The City is not authorized to vacate a street, alley or public place if any portion thereof abuts a body of salt or fresh water unless:

    1. The vacation is sought to enable the City to acquire the property for port purposes, beach or water access purposes, boat moorage or launching sites, park, public view, recreation, or educational purposes, or other public uses;
    2. The City Council, by resolution, declares that the street, alley or public place is not presently being used as a street, alley or public place, and that the street, alley or public place is not suitable for any of the following purposes: Port, beach or water access, boat moorage, launching sites, park, public view, recreation, or education; or
    3. The vacation is sought to enable the City to implement a plan, adopted by resolution or ordinance, that provides comparable or improved public access to the same shoreline area to which the streets, alleys or public places sought to be vacated abut, had the properties included in the plan not been vacated.
2. Before adopting an ordinance vacating a street, alley or public place under subsection A2 of this section, the City Council shall:

    1. Cause an inventory to be compiled of all rights-of-way within the City that abut the same body of water that is abutted by the street, alley or public place sought to be vacated;
    2. Cause a study to be conducted to determine if the street, alley or public place to be vacated is suitable for use by the City for any of the following purposes: Port, boat moorage, launching sites, beach or water access, park, public view, recreation, or education;
    3. Hold a public hearing on the proposed vacation in the manner required by RCW Chapter 35.79 and this chapter; and
    4. Include in its written decision a finding that the street, alley or public place sought to be vacated is not suitable for any of the purposes listed under subsection B2 of this section, and that the vacation is in the public interest.
3. Notice of the public hearing on the proposed vacation shall be posted on the street, alley or public place sought to be vacated, and the notice shall indicate in addition to the requirements of Section 15.62.040 that the area is public access, that it is proposed to be vacated, and that anyone objecting to the proposed vacation should attend the public hearing or send a letter to the Transportation Committee indicating his or her objection.
4. Moneys received from the vacation shall be placed in the Guaranty Deposit Fund and may be used by the City only for the purpose of acquiring additional beach or water access, additional public view sites to a body of water, or additional moorage or launching sites.

#### 15.62.090 - Compensation for vacation.

1. Ordinances vacating any street or alley or part thereof shall not be passed by the City Council until a sum equal to one-half (½) of the appraised value of the area vacated is paid to the City, provided that if the street or alley has been a part of a dedicated public right-of-way for twenty-five years or more, the City shall be compensated in an amount equal to the full appraised value of the area vacated. In certain circumstances, provision of other valuable consideration acceptable to the City may be made in lieu or up to one-half (½) of the payment; provided that such consideration shall not be acceptable if it is required for the street vacation, it is considered a public benefit to meet the public benefit requirements of the street vacation, or it is required by other regulatory action.

Pursuant to agreement with the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, the Director of Transportation may also inspect or cause to be inspected such structures in, along, over, or across park drives and boulevards.


#### 15.76.020 - Inspection costs.

The cost of such inspection shall be paid by the grantee of any such franchise or special permit.

#### 15.76.030 - Chapter not applicable when.

This chapter shall not be applicable to inspections made in accordance with specific provisions of an ordinance authorizing or granting any such franchise or special permit where the payment of the cost of inspection is specifically provided for in such ordinance.


#### 15.76.050 - Barricading of hazards authorized.

If the inspection authorized in Section 15.76.010 should disclose that there is a hazard to the public safety, health or welfare, then the Director of Transportation, and as to park drives and boulevards, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation may order that the grantee of the franchise immediately close the structure and set up barricades, warnings, and/or lights to the extent necessary, so as to prevent public access to the area of the hazard in the interest of public safety. If the City incurs an expense in erecting or maintaining barricades, warnings, lights, and/or detours of traffic, the authorizing official shall bill the owner or occupant the cost thereof together with an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of such costs to cover administrative charges.


#### 15.76.060 - Other protective action.

1. If the inspection authorized in Section 15.76.010 should disclose that the structure is not being maintained in accordance with approved plans and specifications, the Director of Transportation, and as to park drives and boulevards, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation (the "authorizing official") may require that the grantee within ten days present a plan for making the necessary repairs or improvements to bring the structure into as good or better condition than contemplated by the approved plans and specifications, that the plan include time tables for completion of the work, and that the grantee adopt a plan of regular maintenance and repair.
2. If the inspection should disclose that the structure endangers persons in the public place (whether through a collapse, dropping of materials, channelizing water or debris, or subsidence of the surface of the public place) or that the structure does not meet applicable standards of the Building and Construction Code (Title 23), the authorizing official may direct that the grantee at the grantee's expense make immediate repairs to correct the hazard to the public place and to bring the structure into conformity with applicable City codes. The authorizing official, in consultation with the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, may set a reasonable deadline for the grantee to complete the necessary repairs or removal of the structure.
3. Should the grantee fail to make satisfactory progress toward remedying a hazard to the public health, safety, or welfare, or should a reasonable time elapse after notice to the grantee to make such repairs, the Director of Transportation or the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, as to park drives and boulevards, may enter upon the property and take such actions as deemed necessary to protect the public from the hazard; and the owner or grantee shall be liable to the City for the costs thereof together with an amount equal to 15 percent of such costs to cover the City's administrative expenses.
4. In the event a franchise ordinance provides an alternative procedure for remedying a hazard to the public health, safety, or welfare, from such structures, the procedure in the franchise ordinance shall be followed.

Any person aggrieved by a notice of violation issued by the Director pursuant to Section 15.90.006 may obtain a review of the notice by requesting such review in writing within ten (10) days of the date of the notice. When the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until five (5:00) p.m. on the next business day. The request shall be in writing, and within thirty (30) days of the request for review the aggrieved person shall submit any additional information to be considered for the review.

The Director may grant an extension of time for compliance with any notice or Order, whether pending or final, upon the Director's finding that substantial progress toward compliance has been made and that the public will not be adversely affected by the extension. An extension of time may be revoked by the Director if it is shown that the conditions at the time the extension was granted have changed, the Director determines that a party is not performing corrective actions as agreed, or if the extension creates an adverse effect on the public. The date of revocation shall then be considered the compliance date.


#### 15.90.018 - Civil penalty

1. In addition to any other sanction or remedial procedure that may be available, any person or entity violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of Title 15 shall be subject to a cumulative penalty of up to $500 per day for each violation from the date the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. The City shall also be entitled to recovery of its enforcement costs, including, but not limited to staff time, administrative expenses and fees, and costs and attorneys' fees.
2. In addition to the cumulative penalty for violations of Section 15.43.020, any person or entity that destroys, kills, injures, or mutilates a street tree, may be subject to a civil penalty in an amount equal to the appraised value of each affected tree in accordance with the most current edition of the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers 'Guide for Plant Appraisal'. If the violation is found to be willful or malicious, the amount of the penalty may be trebled. In addition, violators shall be responsible for restoring the public place to as good or better condition in conformance with a site plan approved by the Director,
3. The penalty imposed by Section 15.90.018 shall be collected by civil action brought in the name of the City. The Director shall notify the City Attorney in writing of the name of any person subject to the penalty, and the City Attorney shall, with the assistance of the Director, take appropriate action to collect the penalty. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists.
4. Peak Period Penalty Enhancement. In addition to the cumulative $500 penalty per day for each violation pursuant to subsection 15.90.018.A, each person or entity that violates any of the provisions enforced by Chapter 15.90 during a Peak Period shall be subject to an additional penalty of $1,000 per day for each violation. The failure to take immediate action to correct the violation as directed by the Director shall constitute a separate violation.

#### 15.90.020 - Alternative criminal penalty.

Any person who violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of Title 15 shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor subject to the provisions of Chapters 12A.02 and 12A.04, except that absolute liability shall be imposed for such a violation or failure to comply and none of the mental states described in Section 12A.04.030 need be proved. The Director may request the City Attorney to prosecute such violations criminally as an alternative to the notice of violation procedure outlined in this chapter. Each day any person shall continue to violate or fail to comply with the provisions of this title and each occurrence of a prohibited activity shall be deemed and considered a separate offense.


#### 15.90.022 - Additional relief.

The Director may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices and abate any condition which constitutes or will constitute a violation of the Street and Sidewalk Use Code when civil or criminal penalties are inadequate to effect compliance. In any such action, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or will exist; the issuance of the notice of violation or of an order following a review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists or will exist. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Director from abating any use of a public place without a permit or impounding personal property in a public place without a permit pursuant to SMC 15.04.072, 15.18.020, and Chapter 15.38.

A representative from the Department of Transportation may also be present and may present additional information, but attendance by a representative from the Department of Transportation is not required.
3. Disposition. The Hearing Examiner shall determine whether the person's explanation justifies reduction of the monetary penalty.

The above mitigation factors or other mitigating explanations shall not be considered for violations of subsections 15.91.002.A.1 and 15.91.002.A.6.

The Hearing Examiner may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.
3. Sufficiency. No citation shall be deemed insufficient for failure to contain a detailed statement of the facts constituting the specific violation which the person cited is alleged to have committed or by reason of defects or imperfections, provided such lack of detail, or defects or imperfections do not prejudice substantial rights of the person cited.
4. Amendment of Citation. A citation may be amended prior to the conclusion of the hearing to conform to the evidence presented if substantial rights of the person cited are not thereby prejudiced.
5. Evidence at Hearing. The certified statement or declaration authorized by RCW 9A.72.085 shall be prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and that the person cited is responsible.

Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 shall also be admissible without further evidentiary foundation.
