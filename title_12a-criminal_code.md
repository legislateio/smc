## Subtitle I - Criminal Code
### Chapter 12A.02 - GENERAL PROVISIONS—DEFINITIONS

Sections:

#### 12A.02.010 - Title—Effective date.

Chapters 12A.02 through 12A.30, hereinafter referred to as "this subtitle" or "this code" shall be known and may be cited as Seattle Criminal Code and shall become effective on December 3, 1974.


#### 12A.02.020 - Applicability of provisions.

The provisions of this subtitle shall apply to any offense which is defined in this subtitle or the general ordinances committed on or after the effective date hereof, unless otherwise expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires, and shall also apply to any defense to prosecution for such an offense.


#### 12A.02.030 - Offenses committed prior to effective date.

The provisions of this subtitle do not apply to or govern the construction of and punishment for any offense committed prior to the effective date of this subtitle, or to the construction and application of any defense to a prosecution for such an offense. Such an offense must be construed and punished according to the provisions of law existing at the time of the commission thereof in the same manner as if this subtitle had not been enacted.


#### 12A.02.035 - Prosecution under expired or repealed ordinance.

No offense committed and no penalty or forfeiture incurred previous to the time when any ordinance expires or is repealed, whether such repeal be express or implied, shall be affected by such expiration or repeal, unless a contrary intention is expressly declared in the expiring or repealing ordinance, and no prosecution for any offense or for the recovery of any penalty or forfeiture pending at the time any ordinance expires or is repealed, whether such repeal be express or implied, shall be affected by such expiration or repeal, but the same shall proceed in all respects as if such ordinance had not expired or been repealed, unless a contrary intention is expressly declared in the expiring or repealing ordinance. Whenever any ordinance defining an offense or making conduct unlawful is amended or repealed, whether such amendment or repeal be express or implied, any offense committed, conduct engaged in or penalty or forfeiture incurred while the ordinance was in force shall be punished or enforced as if the ordinance were in force, notwithstanding such amendment or repeal, unless a contrary intention is expressly declared in the amendatory or repealing ordinance, and every such amendatory or repealing ordinance shall be so construed as to save all proceedings under the amended or repealed ordinance pending at the time of the amendatory or repealing ordinance, unless a contrary intention is expressly declared therein.


#### 12A.02.040 - Purposes—Principles of construction.

1. The general purposes of the provisions governing the definition of offenses are:

    1. To forbid and prevent conduct that unjustifiably and inexcusably inflicts or threatens harm to individual or public interests;
    2. To safeguard conduct that is without culpability from condemnation as criminal;
    3. To give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to constitute an offense.
2. The provisions of this subtitle shall be construed according to the fair import of their terms but when the language is susceptible of differing constructions it shall be interpreted to further the general purposes stated in this section and the special purposes of the particular provision involved. The discretionary powers conferred by this subtitle shall be exercised in accordance with the criteria stated in this subtitle and, insofar as such criteria are not decisive, to further the general purposes stated in this section.

#### 12A.02.050 - City criminal jurisdiction.

1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person is subject to prosecution under the law of this City for an offense committed by his own conduct or the conduct of another for which he is legally accountable if:

    1. Either the conduct which is an element of the offense or the result which is such an element occurs within this City; or
    2. Conduct occurring outside this City intended to cause a result within this City is sufficient under the law of this City to constitute an attempt to commit an offense within this City; or
    3. Conduct occurring within this City establishes complicity in the commission of, or an attempt, to commit, an offense in another jurisdiction which also is an offense under the law of this City; or
    4. The offense consists of the omission to perform a legal duty imposed by the law of this City with respect to residence or a relationship to a person, thing or transaction in this City; or
    5. The offense is based on an ordinance of this City which expressly prohibits conduct outside the City, when the conduct bears a reasonable relation to a legitimate interest of the City and the actor knows or should know that his conduct is likely to affect that interest.
2. Subsection A1 does not apply when either causing a specified result or an intention to cause or danger of causing such a result is an element of an offense and the result occurs or is designed or likely to occur only in another jurisdiction where the conduct charged would not constitute an offense, unless a legislative purpose plainly appears to declare the conduct criminal regardless of the place of the result.
3. Subsection A1 does not apply when causing a particular result is an element of an offense and the result is caused by conduct occurring outside the City which would not constitute an offense if the result had occurred there, unless the actor knowingly caused the result within this City.

#### 12A.02.060 - Offenses shall be crimes or violations.

Every offense defined by this subtitle or conduct made unlawful thereby shall constitute a crime and a jail sentence may be imposed therefor, except for such offenses or unlawful conduct as shall be specifically designated as violations.


#### 12A.02.070 - Punishment of crime.

1. Every crime without a specific penalty provision, and every crime designated as a gross misdemeanor, may be punished by a fine not to exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000), or by imprisonment for a term not to exceed three hundred sixty-four (364) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
2. Every crime designated as a misdemeanor may be punished by a fine not to exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) or by imprisonment for a term not to exceed ninety (90) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

#### 12A.02.080 - Punishment of violation.

A violation may be punished by a civil fine or forfeiture not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500), but a finding that a violation has been committed shall not give rise to any disability or legal disadvantage based on the conviction of a criminal offense. The court may also order a person found to have committed a violation to make or pay restitution. The terms "violation," "infraction," and "civil infraction" are synonymous.


#### 12A.02.085 - Failure to respond to notice of civil infraction.

A person who, after receiving a notice of civil infraction that includes a statement of the options provided in RCW Chapter 7.80 for responding to the notice and the procedures necessary for exercising these options, knowingly fails to exercise one of the options within fifteen (15) days of the date of the notice is guilty of a misdemeanor regardless of the disposition of the notice. A notice of civil infraction may be complied with by an appearance by counsel.


#### 12A.02.090 - Section 12A.02.080 not denial of constitutional rights.

Notwithstanding the civil nature of the penalty for violations, Section 12A.02.080, does not deny to the defendant constitutional rights he would have were the penalty deemed criminal, provided that a defendant charged with a violation shall not be entitled to a jury trial.


#### 12A.02.100 - Violations—Judgment for fine and costs.

Upon a judgment for fine and costs rendered on a conviction of a violation, execution may be issued against the property of a defendant and returned in the same manner as in civil actions.


#### 12A.02.110 - Violations—Intentional failure to comply.

A court may, in its discretion, treat any intentional failure to comply with a court order in respect to fines or costs or both, upon conviction of a violation, as civil contempt.


#### 12A.02.140 - Arrest—Citations—Authority to detain and check for warrants.

1. As used in this section, "crime" has the meaning specified in Section 12A.02.060.
2. A peace officer may arrest a person without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe that such person has committed a crime.
3. Whenever a person is arrested under subsection B, the arresting officer, or any other authorized peace officer, may serve upon the arrested person a citation and notice to appear in Municipal Court, in lieu of continued custody, as provided by the Rules of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction.
4. Whenever a peace officer has probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime, violation or infraction under any ordinance of the City, the officer may detain such person for a reasonable period of time necessary to identify the person and check for outstanding warrants.
5. Whenever a peace officer has probable cause to believe that a person has committed a violation as defined in Section 12A.02.060, the officer will issue such person a citation and notice to appear in Municipal Court in the same manner as provided by the Rules of Courts of Limited Jurisdiction unless:

    1. The officer is unable to reasonably ascertain the actor's identity; or
    2. The officer reasonably believes that the identification is not accurate, in either of which cases the person may be arrested.
6. Upon an arrest as provided in subsection E, such person may be held only to be photographed, administratively searched and fingerprinted, and must be released immediately upon identification.
7. If a person violates his or her promise to appear in court given in accordance with subsections C or E, a warrant may be issued for his or her arrest and bail may be set.

### Chapter 12A.04 - CRIMINAL LIABILITY DEFENSES

Sections:

#### 12A.04.010 - Requirement of a voluntary act—Possession as an act.

1. A person is not guilty of an offense unless his liability is based on conduct which includes a voluntary act or an omission to perform an act of which he is physically capable.
2. The possession of property is a voluntary act if the actor was aware of his physical possession of such property or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient period to have been able to terminate his possession.
3. For purposes of this section:

    1. "Voluntary act" means a bodily movement performed consciously as a result of the actor's effort or determination.
    2. "Omission" means a failure to perform an act as to which a duty of performance is imposed by law.

#### 12A.04.030 - Kinds of culpability defined.

1. Intent. A person acts with intent or intentionally when he or she acts with the objective or purpose to accomplish a result which constitutes a crime.
2. Knowledge. A person knows or acts knowingly or with knowledge when:

    1. He or she is aware of a fact, facts, or circumstances or result described by an ordinance defining an offense; or
    2. He or she has information which would lead a reasonable person in the same situation to believe that facts exist which facts are described by an ordinance defining an offense.
3. Recklessness. A person is reckless or acts recklessly when he or she knows of and disregards a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his or her disregard of such substantial risk is a gross deviation from conduct that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.
4. Criminal Negligence. A person is criminally negligent or acts with criminal negligence when he or she fails to be aware of a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his or her failure to be aware of such substantial risk constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.
5. Requirement of Wilfulness Satisfied by Acting Knowingly. A requirement that an offense be committed wilfully is satisfied if a person acts knowingly with respect to the material elements of the offense, unless a purpose to impose further requirements plainly appears.

#### 12A.04.050 - Substitutes for criminal negligence—Recklessness and knowledge.

When the Seattle Municipal Code or an ordinance provides that criminal negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, such element also is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly or recklessly. When recklessness suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts intentionally or knowingly. When acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, such element also is established if a person acts intentionally.


#### 12A.04.060 - Culpability as determinant of grade of offense.

When the grade or degree of an offense depends on whether the offense is committed intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence, its grade or degree shall be the lowest for which the determinative kind of culpability is established with respect to any material element of the offense.


#### 12A.04.080 - Divergence between result contemplated and actual result.

When intentionally or knowingly causing a particular result is an element of an offense, the element is not established if the actual result is not within the purpose or the contemplation of the actor unless:


1. The actual result differs from that designed or contemplated, as the case may be, only in the respect that a different person or different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm designed or contemplated would have been more serious or more extensive than that caused; or
2. The actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as that designed or contemplated and is not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a bearing on the actor's liability or on the gravity of his offense.

#### 12A.04.090 - Divergence between probable and actual result.

When recklessly or criminally negligently causing a particular result is an element of an offense, the element is not established if the actual result is not within the risk of which the actor is aware or, in the case of criminal negligence, of which he should be aware unless:


1. The actual result differs from the probable result only in the respect that a different person or different property is injured or affected or that the probable injury or harm would have been more serious or more extensive than that caused; or
2. The actual result involves the same kind of injury or harm as the probable result and is not too remote or accidental in its occurrence to have a bearing on the actor's liability or on the gravity of his offense.

#### 12A.04.100 - Construction of ordinances with respect to culpability requirements.

Where an ordinance defining an offense does not clearly indicate a legislative intent to impose absolute liability, it should be construed as defining an offense requiring one of the mental states described in Section 12A.04.030. This section applies to all offenses defined by the ordinances of this City except those in Chapter 11.56 Seattle Municipal Code.


#### 12A.04.110 - Criminal liability of corporations and persons acting in their behalf.

1. As used in this section:

    1. "Agent" means any director, officer or employee of a corporation, or any other person who is authorized to act in behalf of the corporation.
    2. "Managerial agent" means an officer or director of a corporation or any other person in a position of comparable authority with respect to the formulation of corporate policy or the supervision in a managerial capacity of subordinate employees.
    3. "Corporation" has its ordinary meaning and also includes but is not limited to partnerships, professional service corporations, societies and other unincorporated associations whether organized for profit or nonprofit.
2. A corporation is guilty of an offense when:

    1. The conduct constituting the offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty of affirmative performance imposed on corporations by law; or
    2. The conduct constituting the offense is engaged in, authorized, solicited, requested, commanded, or recklessly tolerated by the board of directors or by a managerial agent acting within the scope of his employment and in behalf of the corporation; or
    3. The conduct constituting the offense is engaged in by an agent of the corporation, other than a managerial agent, while acting within the scope of his employment and in behalf of the corporation and the offense is one defined by an ordinance which indicates a legislative intent to impose such criminal liability on a corporation.
3. A person is criminally liable for conduct constituting an offense which he performs or causes to be performed in the name of or in behalf of a corporation to the same extent as if such conduct were performed in his own name or behalf.
4. Whenever duty to act is imposed by law upon a corporation, any agent of the corporation who knows he has or shares primary responsibility for the discharge of the duty is criminally liable for a reckless or, if a managerial agent, for a criminally negligent omission to perform the required act to the same extent as if the duty were by law imposed directly upon such agent.

#### 12A.04.120 - Criminal attempt.

1. A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, with intent to commit a specific crime, he or she does any act:

    1. Which is a substantial step toward the commission of that crime; and
    2. Which strongly corroborates his or her intent to commit that crime.
2. If the conduct in which a person engages otherwise constitutes an attempt to commit a crime, it is no defense to a prosecution of such attempt that the crime charged to have been attempted was, under the attendant circumstances, factually or legally impossible of commission, if such crime could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as such person believed them to be.
3. When the actor's conduct would otherwise constitute a criminal attempt under this section, it is an affirmative defense that, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal intent, he or she:

    1. Abandoned his or her effort to commit the crime; or
    2. Prevented the commission of the crime.
4. A person may not be convicted on the basis of the same course of conduct of both an attempt to commit an offense and either complicity in or the commission of that offense.
5. This section shall not apply to liability for the conduct of another as defined in Section 12A.04.130.
6. An attempt to commit a crime is a misdemeanor.

#### 12A.04.130 - Liability for conduct of another—Complicity.

1. A person is guilty of an offense if it is attempted or committed by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable.
2. A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when:

    1. Acting with the kind of culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the offense, he causes an innocent or irresponsible person to engage in such conduct; or
    2. He is made accountable for the conduct of such other person by this subtitle or by the law defining the offense; or
    3. He is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the offense.
3. A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if:

    1. With the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he:

        1. Solicits, commands, or requests such other person to commit it, or
        2. Aids or agrees to aid such other person in planning or committing it; or
    2. His conduct is expressly declared by law to establish his complicity.
4. A person who is legally incapable of committing a particular offense himself may be guilty thereof if it is committed by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable, unless such liability is inconsistent with the purpose of the provision establishing his incapacity.
5. Unless otherwise provided by this subtitle or by the law defining the offense, a person is not an accomplice in an offense committed by another person if:

    1. He is a victim of that offense; or
    2. The offense is so defined that his conduct is inevitably incident to its commission; or
    3. He terminates his complicity prior to the commission of the offense and:

        1. Deprives it of effectiveness in the commission of the offense, or
        2. Gives timely warning to the law enforcement authorities or otherwise makes a good faith effort to prevent the commission of the offense.
6. An accomplice may be convicted on proof of the commission of the offense and of his complicity therein, though the person claimed to have committed the offense has not been prosecuted or convicted or has been convicted of a different offense or degree of offense or has an immunity to prosecution or conviction or has been acquitted.
7. A person may not be convicted on the basis of the same course of conduct of both the commission of and complicity in that offense.

#### 12A.04.140 - Ignorance or mistake.

1. A person shall not be relieved of criminal liability because he engages in conduct under a mistaken belief of fact, unless:

    1. Such factual mistake negates the mental state required for the commission of an offense; or
    2. The ordinance defining the offense or ordinance related thereto expressly provides that such factual mistake constitutes a defense or exemption; or
    3. Such factual mistake is of a kind that supports a defense of justification.
2. A person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief that it does not, as a matter of law, constitute an offense, unless such mistaken belief is reasonably founded upon an official statement of the law contained in:

    1. A statute, ordinance, or other enactment; or
    2. An administrative order or grant of permission; or
    3. A judicial decision; or
    4. An interpretation of the statute or law relating to the offense, officially made or issued by a public servant, agency or body legally charged or empowered with the responsibility or privilege of administering, enforcing or interpreting such ordinance.
3. A defense based upon this section is an affirmative defense.

#### 12A.04.150 - Intoxication.

No act committed by a person while in a state of voluntary intoxication shall be deemed less criminal by reason of his/her condition, but whenever the actual existence of any particular mental state is a necessary element to constitute a particular species or degree of crime, the fact of his/her intoxication may be taken into consideration in determining such mental state.


#### 12A.04.160 - Insanity.

To establish the defense of insanity, it must be shown that:


1. At the time of the commission of the offense, as a result of mental disease or defect, the mind of the actor was affected to such an extent that:

    1. He/she was unable to perceive the nature and quality of the act with which he/she is charged; or
    2. He/she was unable to tell right from wrong with reference to the particular act charged.
2. The defense of insanity must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.

#### 12A.04.170 - Duress.

1. In any prosecution for a crime, it is a defense that:

    1. The actor participated in the crime under compulsion by another who by threat or use of force created an apprehension in the mind of the actor that in case of refusal he/she or another would be exposed to immediate death or immediate grievous bodily injury; and
    2. That such apprehension was reasonable upon the part of the actor; and
    3. That the actor would not have participated in the crime except for the duress involved.
2. The defense of duress is not available if the actor intentionally or recklessly places himself/herself in a situation in which it is probable that he/she will be subject to duress.
3. The defense of duress is not established solely by a showing that a married person acted on the command of his or her spouse.

#### 12A.04.180 - De minimis infractions.

The court may dismiss a prosecution if, having regard to the nature of the conduct charged to constitute an offense and the nature of the attendant circumstances, it finds that the defendant's conduct:


1. Was within a customary license or tolerance not inconsistent with the purpose of the law defining the offense; or
2. Did not actually cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense or did so only to an extent too trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction; or
3. Presents such other extenuations that it cannot reasonably be regarded as envisioned by the legislature in forbidding the offense.

#### 12A.04.190 - Entrapment.

1. In any prosecution for a crime, it is a defense that:

    1. The criminal design originated in the mind of law enforcement officials, or any person acting under their discretion; and
    2. The actor was lured or induced to commit a crime which the actor had not otherwise intended to commit.
2. The defense of entrapment is not established by a showing only that law enforcement officials merely afforded the actor an opportunity to commit a crime.

#### 12A.04.200 - Use of force—When lawful.

The use, attempt, or offer to use force upon or toward the person of another is not unlawful in the following cases:


1. Whenever necessarily used by a public officer in the performance of a legal duty, or a person assisting him/her and acting under his/her direction;
2. Whenever necessarily used by a person arresting one who has committed a felony and delivering him/her to a public officer competent to receive him/her into custody;
3. Whenever used by a party about to be injured, or by another lawfully aiding him/her in preventing or attempting to prevent an offense against his person, or a malicious trespass, or other malicious interference with real or personal property lawfully in his/her possession, in which case the force is not more than is necessary;
4.

Restrain the respondent from harassing, following, keeping under physical or electronic surveillance, cyberstalking as defined in Section 12A.06.045, and using telephonic, audiovisual, or other electronic means to monitor the actions, location, or communication of a victim of domestic violence, the victim's children, or members of the victim's household. For the purposes of this subsection, "communication" includes both "wire communication" and "electronic communication" as defined in RCW 9.73.260;
    10. Require the respondent to submit to electronic monitoring. The order shall specify who shall provide the electronic monitoring services and the terms under which the monitoring must be performed.

The court may also prohibit the respondent from knowingly coming within or knowingly remaining within a specified distance of specified locations where the pet is regularly found; and
    13. Order use of a vehicle.
2. If a protection order restrains the respondent from contacting the respondent's minor children, the restraint shall be for a fixed period not to exceed one (1) year. With regard to other relief, if the petitioner has petitioned for relief on his or her own behalf or on behalf of the petitioner's family or household members or minor children, and the court finds that the respondent is likely to resume acts of domestic violence against the petitioner or the petitioner's family or household members or minor children when the order expires, the court may either grant relief for a fixed period or enter a permanent order for protection. If the petitioner has petitioned for relief on behalf of the respondent's minor children, the court shall advise the petitioner that if the petitioner wants to continue protection for a period beyond one (1) year the petitioner may either petition for renewal pursuant to the provisions of this section or may seek relief pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 26.09 or 26.26 RCW.

If timely service cannot be made the court shall set a new hearing date and shall either require additional attempts at obtaining personal service or permit service by publication as provided in RCW 26.50.085 or by mail as provided in RCW 26.50.123. If the court permits service by publication or by mail, the court shall set the new hearing date not later than twenty-four (24) days from the date of the order. If the order expires because timely service cannot be made the court shall grant an ex parte order of protection as provided in Section 12A.06.170. The court shall grant the petition for renewal unless the respondent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent will not resume acts of domestic violence against the petitioner or the petitioner's children or family or household members when the order expires. The court may renew the protection order for another fixed time period or may enter a permanent order as provided in this section. The court may award court costs, service fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees as provided in subsection A6 of this section.
4. In providing relief under this chapter, the court may realign the designation of the parties as "petitioner" and "respondent" where the court finds that original petitioner is the abuser and the original respondent is the victim of domestic violence and may issue an ex parte temporary order for protection in accordance with Section 12A.06.170 on behalf of the victim until the victim is able to prepare a petition for an order for protection in accordance with Section 12A.06.160.
5. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, no order for protection shall grant relief to any party except upon notice to the respondent and hearing pursuant to a petition or counter-petition filed and served by the party seeking relief in accordance with Section 12A.06.160 C.
6. The court order shall specify the date the order expires if any. The court order shall also state whether the court issued the protection order following personal service, service by publication or service by mail and whether the court has approved service by publication or mail of an order issued under this section.
7. If the court declines to issue an order for protection or declines to renew an order for protection, the court shall state in writing on the order the particular reasons for the court's denial.
8. Nothing in this section may affect the title to real estate; provided that judgment for costs or fees shall constitute a lien on real estate to the extent provided in RCW Chapter 4.56.

The purchaser produces a valid concealed pistol license and the dealer has recorded the purchaser's name, license number, and issuing agency, such record to be made in triplicate and processed as provided in subsection D of this section. For purposes of this subsection A1, a "valid concealed pistol license" does not include a temporary emergency license, and does not include any license issued before July 1, 1996, unless the issuing agency conducted a records search for disqualifying crimes under RCW 9.41.070 at the time of issuance; or
    2. The dealer is notified in writing by the chief of police or the sheriff of the jurisdiction in which the purchaser resides that the purchaser is eligible to possess a pistol under RCW 9.41.070 and that the application to purchase is approved by the chief of police or sheriff; or
