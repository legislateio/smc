#### 20.04.020 - Council vote required.

No ordinance relating to local improvements shall be considered passed unless it shall have received the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of the City Council; provided, that unless a petition for any improvement is presented, the improvement shall not be ordered except by ordinance passed by the affirmative vote of two-thirds () of all members of the City Council at a regular meeting, or at a meeting which is an adjournment of a regular meeting; provided, that no streets shall be ordered graded without petition, except by a unanimous vote of all members present.


#### 20.04.030 - Notice of hearings—Mailing.

The Director of Transportation shall mail all notices of hearings on proposed improvements and assessment rolls required by law to be mailed, and shall make all certificates of mailing required by law in such connection, and file the same with the City Clerk.


#### 20.04.040 - Plans, contract and management of work.

After the legislative authority has provided by ordinance for the making of any local improvement, plans therefor shall be approved, the contract let and the work supervised and accepted or rejected, all in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of the City Charter (Contracting requirements) and ordinances implementing said provisions.


#### 20.04.050 - Modes of payment.

There shall be two modes of payment for the portion of the cost and expense of any local improvement contemplated by this chapter, and payable by special assessment, to wit: "immediate payment" and "payment by bonds." The mode adopted shall be the mode petitioned for in case the improvement shall be made upon petition. Otherwise, the Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall make a recommendation to the City Council as to the mode of payment, and the mode shall be the one designated in the ordinance ordering such improvement.


#### 20.04.060 - Preliminary assessment roll.

1. After the City has ordered a local improvement and created a local improvement district by ordinance, the Director of Transportation shall prepare, and within 15 days after the improvement of work has been ordered and a local improvement district created, file with the Director of Finance and Administrative Services the following:

    1. The title of the improvement;
    2. The district number;
    3. Copy of a diagram or print showing the boundaries of the district;
    4. Preliminary assessment roll or abstract thereof showing the lots, tracts and parcels of land that will be especially benefited;
    5. The estimated cost and expense of such improvement to be borne by each such lot, tract or parcel; and
    6. The name of the owner thereof, if known, but in no case shall a mistake in the name of the owner affect the validity of any assessment when the description of the property is correct.
2. The Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall immediately post the proposed assessment roll upon his or her index of local improvement district assessments against the properties affected.

#### 20.04.070 - Final assessment roll—Hearing—Date, notice and general procedure.

1. The Director of Transportation shall prepare and file with the City Clerk the proposed final assessment roll. Upon receipt of such roll, the City Council shall by resolution fix a date for a hearing on the roll before the City Council, a committee thereof, the City Hearing Examiner, or an officer, as designated in the resolution, and direct the City Clerk to give notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing by publication at least five (5) times in the official daily newspaper or at least two (2) times in a weekly newspaper of general circulation in the community where the improvement is constructed; provided, that at least fifteen (15) days must elapse between the date of the last publication thereof and the date fixed for the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the City Clerk or a person designated by the City Clerk to do so under his/her supervision to the owner or reputed owner of each property described on the assessment roll, at the address shown on the tax rolls of the County Comptroller at least fifteen (15) days before the date fixed for such hearing. At the time fixed for the hearing, the City Council, a committee thereof, the Hearing Examiner, or designated officer shall sit as a Board of Equalization for the purpose of considering the assessment roll.
2. The City Council may proceed with consideration of the final assessment roll, as follows:

    1. Unless otherwise determined by ordinance or by City Council resolution, the proposed final assessment roll shall be filed within ninety (90) days following the completion and acceptance of the improvement;
    2. If the ordinance authorizing the improvement so states, award of the improvement contract or commencement of work by the City shall be deferred until confirmation and filing of the assessment roll, and until funds for the improvements are assured in the judgment of the City Council expressed by resolution; or
    3. A final assessment roll may be considered at such other time, before, during or after the commencement or completion of improvements, as may be determined by ordinance or City Council resolution.

#### 20.04.080 - Final assessment roll—Departmental representatives at hearing.

One or more representatives of the Director of Transportation and any affected department of the City may be designated by the department head to assist in the presentation of pertinent materials at the hearing.


#### 20.04.090 - Final assessment roll—Hearing—Conduct.

In a hearing before the City Council, a committee thereof, the Hearing Examiner or designated officer, the City Attorney shall be the legal representative of the local improvement district.


1. The City Council, the committee thereof, the Hearing Examiner or officer designated by the City Council shall commence the hearing on the date and at the time and place fixed by the resolution of the City Council, but may in the exercise of discretion recess the hearing to times certain in order to allow the parties to obtain essential additional information, provided, however, that an effort shall be made at all times to avoid delays which unnecessarily allow interest to accumulate upon obligations for which the local improvement district is responsible.

    1. The Hearing Examiner or officer shall reduce his/her findings, recommendations and decisions to writing and shall file them with the City Clerk within twenty (20) days following the conclusion of the hearing. Notice of the filing, together with copies of the findings, recommendations and decisions shall be mailed by the City Clerk or any person designated by the City Clerk to do so under his/her supervision within three (3) business days of the filing to all persons who filed timely written objections to confirmation of the assessment roll as prepared. Instructions as to the filing of any appeal to the City Council shall be included in the mailing.
2. Upon receipt of the report, findings, recommendations and decisions of the Hearing Examiner or officer the City Council or a committee thereof shall review the same. As soon as all timely appeals from the findings, recommendations and decisions of Hearing Examiner or officer have been decided or the time allowed for filing appeals has expired with no appeals having been filed the City Council may accept the assessment roll as prepared, or may correct, revise, raise, lower, change or modify the roll or any part thereof, or may set aside the roll and order the assessment to be made de novo, and at the conclusion thereof, and after the Director of Transportation has made the appropriate changes on the assessment roll at the City Council's direction, confirm the roll by ordinance. If an appeal has been filed from the findings, recommendations and decisions of the Hearing Examiner or officer it shall be heard and determined and the results thereof incorporated into the assessment roll before it is confirmed.
3. Any finding, recommendation or decision of the Hearing Examiner, or officer designated by the City Council to conduct a hearing pursuant to RCW 35.44.070 and RCW 35.44.080, shall be subject to appeal to the City Council, which may direct that the appeal shall be heard by a committee thereof.
4. An appeal pursuant to subsection C of this section may be filed only by a party who timely perfected a protest at the initial hearing. The notice of appeal shall, in addition to requirements as to content specified elsewhere in this chapter, state clearly on the cover or cover page the number of the local improvement district and the appellant's name and shall be filed with the City Clerk no later than the fourteenth (14) day after the day upon which the report and recommendation of the Hearing Examiner or other officer is filed with the City Clerk.

    1. Upon the filing of a notice of appeal the City Clerk shall immediately notify the City Attorney and furnish a copy of the notice to the City Council and the City Departments immediately concerned. Within fifteen (15) days following the filing of a notice of appeal the City Council shall set a time and place for a hearing on the appeal before the City Council or a committee thereof and shall immediately mail or cause to be mailed notice of the time and place to the appellant, provided the time shall be as soon as practicable in order to avoid accumulation of additional interest on the obligations of the local improvement district.
5. Review by the City Council or Council Committee on appeal shall be limited to and shall be based solely upon the record from the hearing below, provided, however, that the City Council or the appropriate City Council committee may permit oral or written arguments or comments when confined to the content of the record of the hearing below. Written arguments shall not be considered unless filed with the City Council or Council Committee prior to the conclusion of the hearing on appeal, and the City Council or committee thereof may determine the appeal on the record, with or without written argument.
6. The recommendation appealed from shall be accorded substantial weight and the burden of establishing the contrary shall be upon the appealing party. In respect to the matter appealed the City Council may adopt or reject, in whole or in part, the findings, recommendations and decisions of the Hearing Examiner or officer or make such other disposition of the matter as is authorized by RCW 35.44.100 and subsection B of this section above. The City Council shall reduce its determination to writing, file the original in the record of the local improvement district, and transmit a copy of the same to the appellant. No ordinance confirming an assessment roll shall be enacted by the legislative authority until all appeals to the City Council or a committee thereof are decided.

#### 20.04.100 - Hearing records—Requirements.

1. All papers, exhibits, protests, documents, verbatim records of proceedings, transcripts and findings, recommendations and decisions of any kind which are filed in connection with a hearing on an assessment roll, preliminary or final, shall be placed in a file created by the City Clerk to receive all materials related to the assessment rolls of such local improvement district. The City Clerk shall cause the contents of the file to be assigned subnumbers, item by item, in the order of filing. Items filed at hearings shall be assigned the next consecutive subnumber according to the order of filing. All hearings shall be electronically recorded and a memorandum identifying and locating the tapes shall become a part of the file aforementioned.
2. The City Council, the Committee thereof, the Hearing Examiner or the officer conducting a hearing on a final assessment roll shall designate a person acceptable to the City Clerk to act as clerk for the hearing. Such person shall be responsible to the City Clerk for all City files required to be at the hearing and for transmitting to the City Clerk, at the conclusion of the hearing, all files obtained from the City Clerk for use during the hearing together with all additional documents, papers or exhibits of any kind which have become additions to any file during the hearing.
3. Separate files, in such numbers as may be convenient, may be created and maintained for the estimate/contract/construction phase of any local improvement district project, in the City Clerk's discretion. All such files shall be cross-referenced to the pertinent local improvement district number and the ordinance creating said district.

#### 20.04.110 - Appeal to City Council.

In the event of an appeal to the City Council or a committee thereof the notice of appeal shall cite by page and line and quote verbatim that portion or portions of the findings, recommendations and decisions of the Hearing Examiner or officer from which the appeal is taken. The notice of appeal shall also include a concise statement of the basis therefor and in the event that appellant deems the references on the findings, recommendations and decisions inadequate, a reference by metered index numbers to the places in the electronically prepared record of the hearing where the pertinent material may be found. The notice of appeal shall also designate by name or title and by subnumber the items or exhibits in the record to which reference will be made in argument or comment before the City Council or committee. Preparation of a written verbatim transcript of all or any designated part of the hearing shall be at the appellant's initiative and expense, but shall not be required unless within five (5) working days after the filing of a notice of appeal the City Council or designated committee thereof so notifies the appellant, who in no event shall be required to pay the cost of any portion of a verbatim transcript not pertinent to appellant's own appeal.


#### 20.04.120 - Confirmation by ordinance—Procedure.

The ordinance confirming any assessment roll shall levy and assess against each lot, tract, or parcel of land, or other property appearing upon such roll, the amount charged against the same. Upon the enactment of the ordinance, the roll shall be delivered to the City Clerk, together with a list containing the lots and the names of the owners thereof upon which the collection of local improvement district assessments will be deferred pursuant to RCW 35.43.250. The City Clerk shall forthwith transmit the same to the Director of Finance and Administrative Services, with his or her certificate that the same has been duly approved by ordinance, and annually thereafter, in the case of assessments payable by the mode of "payment of bonds," the Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall extend the installments of principal and interest upon any unpaid balance as shown upon said approved roll. Interest shall be at the rate fixed by the ordinance confirming the assessment roll.


#### 20.04.130 - Mode of "immediate payment."

1. Whenever the cost and expense of any improvement shall be payable by the mode of "immediate payment," the Director of Finance and Administrative Services, upon receipt of the assessment roll as confirmed by ordinance, shall publish a notice in the official newspaper of the City once a week for two consecutive weeks that the roll is in his or her hands for collection, and that all or any portion of the assessment may be paid within 30 days from the date of the first publication of the notice without penalty, interest or cost, and that unless payment be made within such time, the assessment or unpaid portion thereof will become delinquent. Within 15 days of the first newspaper publication, the Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall notify each owner or reputed owner whose name appears on the assessment roll, at the address shown on the King County tax rolls for each item of property described on the assessment roll, of the nature of the assessment, of the amount of his or her property subject to such assessment, of the total amount of the assessment due, and of the time during which such assessment may be paid without penalty, interest or costs. In the case of assessments the collection of which has been deferred pursuant to RCW 35.43.250 and RCW 35.54.100, as now existing or hereafter amended, the notice shall also state that the assessment shall be paid within the period of deferral and that unless the assessment the collection of which has been deferred is paid within such period of deferral, the assessment or any unpaid portion thereof will become delinquent. Reference to deferred collection assessments may be omitted from the notice when there is no provision for deferred collection in the ordinance creating the district.
2. Upon delinquency a penalty of 20-percent of the assessment shall attach to, and become part of all assessments. Delinquent assessments shall bear interest until paid at a percentage rate to be fixed by the ordinance confirming the assessment roll. Delinquent assessments, penalties and interest shall forthwith be collected and the lien thereof enforced in the manner provided by statute, the City Charter and ordinances of the City.

#### 20.04.135 - Foreclosure of delinquent assessments.

When any local improvement district or utility local improvement district assessment is payable in installments, upon failure to pay any installment due, the assessment shall become immediately due and payable, and the collection thereof shall be enforced by foreclosure. The payment of all delinquent installments, together with interest, penalty and costs, at any time before the entry of judgment in foreclosure shall extend the time of payment on the remainder of the assessment installments as if there had been no delinquency or foreclosure. Foreclosure proceedings may be commenced at any time on or before September 15 of the year in which, on the first day of January of such year, two (2) installments of any local improvement district or utility local improvement district assessment were delinquent or the final installment was delinquent for more than one (1) year. In case of foreclosure, there shall be added to the costs and expenses provided by Chapter 35.50 RCW, such reasonable attorneys' fees as the court may adjudge to be equitable, and the amount thereof shall be apportioned to each delinquent assessment or installment appearing on that roll. When one (1) or more delinquent installments are paid before the foreclosure proceedings are completed, payment of such costs shall be a prerequisite to the city's dismissal of such proceedings unless otherwise ordered by the court.


#### 20.04.140 - Mode of "payment by bonds."

1. Whenever the cost and expense of any improvement shall be payable by the mode of "payment by bonds," the Director of Finance and Administrative Services, upon receipt of the assessment roll as confirmed by ordinance, shall publish a notice in the official newspaper of the City once a week for two consecutive weeks that the roll is in his or her hands for collection and that all or any portion of the assessment may be paid within 30 days from the date of the first publication of the notice without penalty, interest or cost. Within 15 days of the first newspaper publication, the Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall notify each owner or reputed owner whose name appears on the assessment roll, at the address shown on the tax rolls of King County for each item of property described on the assessment roll, of the nature of the assessment, of the amount of his or her property subject to such assessment, of the total amount of the assessment due, and of the time during which such assessment may be paid without penalty, interest or costs. In the case of assessments or of any installment thereof the collection of which has been deferred pursuant to RCW 35.43.250 and RCW 35.54.100, as existing or hereafter amended, the notice shall also state that the assessment or any installment shall be paid within such period of deferral and that unless the assessments or installments, the collection of which have been deferred are paid within such period of deferral, such assessment or unpaid portion or installment thereof will become delinquent.
2. Unless collection of an assessment has been deferred pursuant to RCW 35.43.250 and RCW 35.54.100 as now existing or hereafter amended, the first installment of principal and interest of any assessment payable under the mode of "payment by bonds" shall become due and payable during the 30 day period succeeding a date one year after the date of first publication of the notice by the Director of Finance and Administrative Services that the assessment roll is in his or her hands for collection, and annually thereafter each succeeding installment of principal or interest shall become due and payable in like manner. All installments must be paid in sequential order. Whenever an installment shall become due and payable, the Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall mail a notice thereof to the owner of the property assessed, when the post office address of such owner is known, but failure to mail the same shall not affect the validity of the assessment lien. Any such installment not paid prior to the expiration of the 30 day period during which such installment is due and payable shall thereupon become delinquent.
3. Whenever the collection of an installment of an assessment has been deferred pursuant to RCW 35.43.250 and RCW 35.54.100 as existing or hereafter amended, the installment of principal or interest shall become due and payable upon expiration of the period of such deferral and each succeeding installment of principal or interest shall become due and payable in like manner. Any such installment not paid within 30 days after expiration of the period of such deferral shall thereupon become delinquent.
4. All delinquent installments shall, until paid, be subject to an additional charge of 20-percent levied upon the principal and interest due on such installment or installments.

#### 20.04.145 - Installment notes.

In addition to the issuance of bonds and warrants in payment of the cost of any local improvement, the City Council may, in the ordinance ordering any such improvement and adopting the mode of payment, direct the issuance of local improvement installment notes and certificates payable out of the local improvement district fund, and to the extent provided by law from the Local Improvement Guaranty Fund, when such notes are to be held exclusively by one or more other City funds as authorized by RCW 35.45.150. Loans evidenced by such notes shall comply with RCW 35.45.150. The total sum of all outstanding principal on such installment notes shall not at any time exceed $1,000,000.00.

The Director of Finance and Administrative Services may refund such installment notes by the issuance of local improvement district bonds or consolidated local improvement district bonds in accordance with RCW Chapter 35.45, and may transfer any such notes, at par plus accrued interest among funds of the City.


#### 20.04.150 - Special fund for each district.

The ordinance creating any local improvement district shall also create a special fund to be called "Local Improvement Fund, District No. ," into which shall be placed all sums from any source intended for use in the prosecution of the work contemplated by such ordinance and, when the assessment roll has been confirmed, all sums paid on account of such assessment, including all interest and penalty thereon, and in the event of sale of bonds by the City, all proceeds of sale and all premiums and accrued interest on bonds issued for such improvement. The moneys in such local improvement district fund derived from assessments shall be used for no other purpose than the redemption of warrants drawn upon and bonds issued against the fund to provide payment for the cost and expense of the improvement. Provided, that if the fund is solvent at the time payment is ordered, the Director of Finance and Administrative Services may elect to make payment for the cost and expense of the improvement by check.


#### 20.04.160 - Bonds—Issuance.

Local improvement bonds shall be issued and sold in such denominations, in such form, and with such terms and conditions as shall be authorized by ordinance and as contemplated by state law, presently codified as RCW Chapter 35.45.


#### 20.04.170 - Bonds—Register required.

The Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall keep in his or her office a register of all such bonds issued. He or she shall enter therein the local improvement fund district number, for which the same are issued, and the date, amount and number of each bond and term of payment.


#### 20.04.180 - Consolidated districts authorized when.

The City may, from time to time, authorize the establishment of consolidated local improvement districts for the purpose of issuing bonds to fund or refund outstanding local improvement district obligations in the manner contemplated by state law, presently codified as RCW 35.45.155 and RCW 35.45.160.


#### 20.04.190 - Delinquent assessments—Foreclosure procedures.

The City Attorney may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with RCW Chapter 35.50.


#### 20.04.200 - Warrants—Call and payment.

1. It shall be the duty of the Director of Finance and Administrative Services to call and pay in numerical order such outstanding warrants against any particular improvement fund as he or she may be able to pay with the money on hand credited to such fund, and whenever he or she shall have money on hand to the credit of such fund, but not sufficient to pay the whole of the next succeeding outstanding warrant, he or she may call in and pay such portion thereof as shall exhaust the amount of such fund; provided, however, that the Director of Finance and Administrative Services may call the warrants issued to the contractor on estimates of the department head supervising the construction in any local improvement district as soon as the City Council has, by resolution or ordinance, fixed a date for the issuance of bonds or installment notes in respect to such local improvement district.
2. Whenever the Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall pay a portion of any warrant as above provided, he or she shall endorse upon such warrant the date and amount of such payment and take a receipt from the holder thereof, showing the number and description of such warrant and the date and amount so paid, which receipt the said Director shall record as a voucher for the money so paid.

#### 20.04.210 - Contracts—Requirements generally.

1. Contracts for local improvements shall provide for a retainage from the moneys earned by the contractor on estimates during the progress of the improvement or work of a sum to be used as a trust fund for the protection and payment of any person or persons, mechanics, subcontractors or material men who shall perform any labor upon such contract or the doing of said work, and all persons who shall supply such person or persons or subcontractors with provisions and supplies for the carrying on of such work, and the state with respect to taxes imposed pursuant to RCW Title 82 which may be due from subcontractor. Said fund shall be computed and administered pursuant to Chapter 205, 1st Ex. Sess., Laws of 1977, presently codified as RCW 60.28.010. No improvement shall be deemed completed until the department head supervising the project shall have filed with the City Clerk a statement in duplicate declaring the same to have been completed.
2. During the time allowed for the completion of the contract the department head supervising the project shall each month issue an estimate of the amount of work completed by the contractor during the preceding month; provided, that after the expiration of the time allowed for such completion no estimate other than the final estimate shall be issued. The final estimate shall include a statement of the amount of money due the contractor, a statement of the amount of money expended for abstracts, advertising, accounting and collection, and engineering expense incurred prior to the expiration of the time allowed for the completion of the contract. The City's engineering expenses incurred after the time allowed for the completion of the contract, shall be borne by the contractor as the minimum penalty for failure to complete the work within the specified time.
3. After the issuance of the estimate by the department head supervising the project, the Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall, on or about the 25th day of the month, deliver to the contractor money or warrants in an amount equal to such estimate less the percentage to be retained therefrom as herein provided. After the expiration of 30 days following the final acceptance of said improvement or work and the expiration of the time for the filing of lien claims as provided by law, said reserve, or all amounts thereof in excess of a sufficient sum to meet and discharge the claims of material men and laborers who have filed their claim as provided by law, together with a sum sufficient to defray the cost of such action, and to pay attorney's fees, shall be paid to said contractor.
4. Such warrants shall be drawn against the local improvement district fund and shall bear interest at the rate prevailing in the market from the date of issuance until redeemed; provided, that warrants shall not bear interest after 240 days from the time fixed in the proposal and contract for the completion of the contract.
5. If the work is completed within the time fixed by the contract, or any extension thereof, and there is no money available for payment of contractors' warrants at the expiration of the 240 day period above mentioned, the contractor may be paid by separate non-interest-bearing warrants a sum equivalent to interest at the rate prevailing in the market on outstanding warrants from the date when interest on such warrants ceased to the date when funds are available for the redemption thereof.
6. If an extension of time is granted for the completion of the contract and the work is not completed when the extension period has expired, the contractor may be paid by separate non-interest-bearing warrants a sum equivalent to interest at the rate prevailing in the market on outstanding warrants from the day when interest ceased, as above mentioned, to a date 240 days from the date on which the extension period expires.
7. The Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall immediately upon receipt of the final estimate for a local improvement, file in the office of the City Clerk a certificate setting forth the total amount of said final estimate, together with accrued interest on warrants issued or to be issued.
8. All warrants issued shall be redeemed in cash, in order of issuance within 240 days after the completion and acceptance of the contract, so far as payment into the local improvement district fund shall permit. Warrants not so redeemed in cash shall, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, be redeemed in order of their issuance in local improvement district bonds, the lowest numbered warrants being redeemed with the lowest numbered bonds, if the mode of payment is "payment by bonds"; or, if the mode of payment be "immediate payment," by the issuance of local improvement district fund warrants with interest at the rate prevailing in the market from the date of issuance until redeemed, such redemption to be made in the same manner as that followed under the mode of payment "payment by bonds."
9. If the mode of payment is "payment by bonds" and the bonds are sold as provided in this chapter, all such warrants not so redeemed in cash as above provided, shall be redeemed in order of issuance in cash out of the proceeds of the sale of such bonds.

#### 20.04.220 - Contracts—To lowest bidders—Notice—Check with bid.

All the work to be done in any local improvement district shall be let in one contract or, at the option of the head of the department supervising the project, the work may be subdivided and separate contracts be let for each subdivision thereof. All local improvements to be made by contract shall be let to the lowest and best bidder therefor. Before the award of any such contract, there shall be published for at least two days in the official newspaper of the City a notice, the last publication being at least ten days before the letting of such contract, inviting sealed proposals for such work, and the plans and specifications whereof must, at the time of publication of such notice, be on file in the office of the department head supervising the project, subject to public inspection. Such notice shall state generally the work to be done and shall call for proposals for doing the same, sealed and filed with the City as specified in the notice, on or before the day and hour named therein. All bids shall be accompanied by a certified check, payable to the order of the Director of Finance and Administrative Services, or a surety bond for a sum not less than 5-percent of the amount of the bid, and no bid shall be considered unless accompanied by such check or bond. If, in the discretion of the head of the department supervising the project, the work should be done by the City by day labor, and under the management of the department, it is hereby empowered to proceed with the work irrespective of all such bids, and, in such case, all bids shall be rejected; provided, however, the work shall not be done by the City if the determination so to do is in conflict with the provisions of RCW 35.22.620.

A Department may contract with a Consultant on the appropriate roster for assignments or projects within the described specialty without soliciting proposals as previously set forth in this chapter as long as: (A) each Contract is estimated to cost no more than the amount established pursuant to SMC Section 20.50.110; and (B) the Department has determined that its needs can be fully met without soliciting proposals through public advertising.


#### 20.50.110 - Establishment and operation of rosters.

These provisions apply to the establishment, maintenance, and use of Consultant rosters:


1. Establishment and Duration.

    1. The Director, in conjunction with participating Departments, shall establish Consultant rosters based on the different consultant skills or services that the City is likely to need during the effective time of the Consultant rosters.
    2. The Director, in conjunction with participating Departments, shall issue Requests for Qualifications ("RFQ(s)") to establish Consultant rosters for use by any Department. At a minimum, the RFQ shall describe the skills or services needed by the City; the minimum qualifications to be placed on the particular Consultant roster; the roster contract dollar limits; the expected duration of the roster, if known; standard contract terms and conditions, if any; and a description of the process to be used for selecting Consultants off of the roster.
    3. A Consultant roster shall remain in effect until such time as the Director determines it is in the best interests of the City to disestablish the roster. Departments may petition for the establishment or disestablishment of a roster, or a roster category where the existing rosters or roster categories do not meet the needs of the Department.
2. Opportunities for Small Business. Whenever 15 or more Consultants qualify as "small business concerns" in a single roster category, the category shall consist only of those Consultants who are eligible to be classified as a "small business concern." If 14 or fewer such Consultants are qualified, Consultants for that roster category shall be selected without regard to their eligibility under the small business criteria. A Consultant may evidence its qualification as a "small business concern" by:

    1. Showing its qualification as a Small Business under the Small Business Act of the United States, 15 USC Section 632, and its implementing regulations, 13 CFR Part 121 or any successor legislation or regulations; or
    2. Showing certification as defined in any City program designed to encourage the utilization of small businesses.
3. Limitations.

    1. A Department may contract with the Consultants on the roster for projects estimated to cost no more than $260,000 in 2010 dollars except as may be adjusted pursuant to subsection 20.50.110.C2.
    2. A Department may amend any roster Contract for additional work related to the original roster Contract up to a total Contract amount of $325,000 in 2010 dollars.

4. Deletion From a Roster. The Director may delete a Consultant from the City's certified roster program at his or her discretion.
5. Adding to a Roster. During the existence of a roster, the Department of Finance and Administrative Services will perform, with assistance as needed from participating Departments, ongoing evaluations of any new Consultant application to a roster. All Consultants found to be qualified for a Consultant roster category will be added to that roster, except as a roster category may be limited to small businesses and except as a Consultant may be removed from the roster at the discretion of the Director.
6. Use of Roster Consultants Not Required. Placement on a Consultant roster makes a Consultant eligible for consideration and possible selection by a participating Department for providing services. Placement on a roster does not guarantee any Consultant any Contract for any amount. In addition, the City reserves the power to amend or repeal this chapter and to change or discontinue the roster system at any time.
7. Evaluation Criteria. Consultants shall be evaluated for placement on a roster on the basis of the ability of the Consultant to perform the work or service that the roster category was created for and to meet the minimum qualifications set forth in the request for qualifications.

#### 20.50.120 - Escalation of dollar limitations.

All monetary amounts referenced in this chapter shall be adjusted annually by the Director following publication of the preceding year's annual Consumer Price Index.

The intent of this adjustment is to eliminate the effects of inflation or deflation on purchasing power and the authority granted by this chapter. All such monetary amounts, as adjusted, shall be rounded upwards to the nearest thousand dollars.


#### 20.50.130 - Retention of expert witnesses and legal counsel.

In retaining any provider of legal advice or any expert witness in connection with anticipated or actual litigation, the Law Department, consistent with the City's legal interests, shall make reasonable efforts in good faith to contact and retain women and minorities, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter.

2. The City shall require, whenever practicable, its vendors, contractors and consultants to use recycled content paper on all documents submitted to the City. In addition, the City shall require, whenever practicable, its vendors, contractors, and consultants to use reusable products, recycled-content products and recyclable products. Failure of a vendor, contractor, or consultant to specify how it will comply this requirement may cause the City to determine that a bid is non-responsive.
3. The City shall maintain minimum content standards for the purchase of designated products, as consistent with USEPA and Washington State products and standards.
4. The Director may use recycled material content as a factor in determining the lowest and best bid in its procurement of goods and materials.

8. These policies are intended to be compatible with the strategies and standards of the City's environmental management and sustainable purchasing programs.
9. Existing procurement policies and specifications shall be revised to include recycled content products or recyclable products unless the products do not meet an established performance standard of a department. In such situations, a department must provide the Director with satisfactory evidence that, for technical reasons, and for a particular end use, a product containing such materials will not meet reasonable performance standards.

##### 20.60.206 - Annual report.

The Director shall provide an annual report to the City Council each year on the status of buy recycled activities. This report shall include data on the City's purchases of recycled content products, recyclable products, and reusable products. The Director may require periodic reporting by other departments to the Department of Finance and Administrative Services for the purpose of developing this report.


##### 20.60.207 - Reusable products.

1. City departments shall purchase reusable products including but not limited to office furniture and partitions, removable wall systems, laser printer toner cartridges and retreadable tires.

##### 20.60.208 - Standards for recycled content.

The content standards may address other items as deemed appropriate by the Director.


1. The Director shall adopt standards that specify minimum recycled content, recyclability, reusability, or other aspects of environmental preferability, consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA"). Washington State standard, and any City environmental management plan. In no case shall these standards be less stringent than USEPA standards. In addition, the Department may adopt standards for products that have not been addressed by USEPA or Washington State. The standards shall place primary emphasis upon the percentage of post-consumer waste content and the recyclability of the product.

    1. Recycled content product. The content standards shall address required amounts of recycled materials. The content standards may break down recycled materials into specified required amounts of post-consumer waste and secondary waste. The required amount of recycled materials shall be:

        1. For all products for which the USEPA adopts procurement guidelines under RCRA, the required amount of recycled materials shall be at least that amount as specified in the guidelines and shall change as the guidelines are updated and adopted.
        2. For all other products, the amount of recycled materials shall be at least twenty-five (25) percent of all materials contained in the product.
2. The recyclability of a material shall be determined by whether or not in-City collection systems are in place to divert the material from City solid waste for use as a raw material in the manufacture of another product or the reuse of the same product. The existence of regional markets and identifiable end uses for a material shall also be taken into consideration when determining the recyclability of a material.
3. The Director shall consult with the appropriate departments regarding technical and performance specifications for products in those situations where a department has specific expertise in the use of the product or the establishment of the product's performance specifications.
4. The standards and specifications established pursuant to this section shall guide product purchasing by the Director and all departments.
5. Standards established pursuant to this section shall be developed for any additional products for which either Washington State or USEPA recycled-content standards are developed in the future. In addition, the Director may, at his or her discretion, adopt content standards for products for which standards have not been established by Washington State or the USEPA.

##### 20.60.210 - Price preference.

1. The Director shall adopt rules for applying a price preference toward the purchase of recycled-content products. The rules shall be applicable to purchases by the Director and all departments for those products identified in this subchapter, as well as for other products for which content standards are developed according to SMC Section 20.60.208. The rules shall include a maximum price preference of ten (10) percent of the lowest and best bid or price quoted by suppliers offering products without recycled content for recycled content products (as defined in SMC Section 20.60.202), unless the Director determines that a different price preference is warranted based upon factors such as the prevailing market price, product availability, and product quality. The rules shall include a price preference of fifteen (15) percent of the lowest and best bid or price quoted by suppliers offering products without recycled content, for local recycled-content products (as defined in SMC Section 20.60.202) unless the Director determines that a different preference is warranted based upon factors such as the prevailing market price, availability and product quality.
2. A price preference shall be applied only to those bids where a nonrecycled content product is determined to have the lowest and best bid and similar products with recycled content have also responded to the bid. Where the Director determines that the purchase of a recycled-content, recyclable or reusable product is practicable as defined in SMC Section 20.60.204, a price preference shall not be applied. Upon determination that the purchase of such a product is practicable, the Director shall require that recycled content, recyclability or reusability be required as specifications in any invitations to bid for that product.

##### 20.60.212 - Requirements for purchase contracts.

1. The Director shall use the standards, procedures, and criteria specified in this chapter in conjunction with other factors as authorized by Charter and ordinance. If a bidder, in response to any invitation to bid, offers to supply the City with one (1) or more recycled-content or recyclable products, the Director shall reduce the actual bid amount for each such product by the applicable price preference developed pursuant to SMC Section 20.60.210. The reduced bid amount for each such product shall be used only for purposes of determining the lowest and best bid. However, nothing in this subchapter shall preclude the Director from requiring local recycled content, recycled content or recyclable content as specifications in invitations to bid for any products. The Director may adopt specifications requiring that only local recycled-content products, recycled-content products or recyclable-content products be responsive even though the cost of such goods exceeds ten (10) percent of the price of equivalent products without recycled content.

##### 20.60.214 - Bid notification.

A statement regarding the Director's or a department's intent to procure recycled-content products or recyclable-content products must be prominently displayed in the procurement solicitation or invitation to bid including:


1. A statement in each product specification describing the post-consumer waste content or recycled-content preferred; and
2. A statement describing the City's price preference policy for recycled-content products and the manner in which such price preference for recycled-content products shall be applied in evaluating the responses or bids; and
3. A statement that the Director or any department which procures a product shall have the right to verify the certification by review of the bidder or manufacturer's records as a condition of the bid award.

##### 20.60.216 - Vendor certification of recycled material content.

1. After December 1, 1992, vendors shall certify the percentage of recycled content in products sold to the City, including the percentage of post-consumer waste that is in the product. The certification shall be in the form of a label on the product or a statement by the vendor attached to the bid documents.
2. The certification on multicomponent or multimaterial products shall verify the percentage and type of post-consumer waste and recycled content by volume contained in the major constituents in the product.
3. Products which meet certification rules and guidelines adopted by The State of Washington or USEPA shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this section.

##### 20.60.218 - Rules and regulations for procurement of paper and paper products including the following provisions.

1. The Director and departments shall purchase and/or use only recycled-content paper for all imprinted letterhead, envelope and business card paper, file folders, writing and message tablets, photocopy paper, sanitary papers, packaging papers, and printing papers. In addition, the Director and departments shall purchase recycled-content photocopy paper that has not been bleached with a chlorine-based lighting process, including elemental chlorine gas, chlorine dioxide, or hypochlorite when nonchlorinated bleached photocopy paper is readily available and similarly priced.
2. Departments shall publicize the City's use of recycled paper by printing the words "Printed on Recycled Paper" or a recycled content logo on all letterhead, envelope and business card paper and on the title page of all reports printed on recycled paper, or by using recycled paper which is watermarked with the recycled content logo.

##### 20.60.220 - Requirements and procedures for designation and procurement of other recycled-content products and recyclable products.

Any department or vendor may petition the Director to qualify a product as a recycled content or recyclable product on a case-by-case and/or product-by-product basis. The department or vendor shall be responsible for providing sufficient evidence to the Director that the product qualifies for the purpose of procuring recycled content or recyclable products.


##### 20.60.222 - Capital improvement projects and construction contracts.

1. The City's preference for the purchase and use of recycled-content products shall be included as a factor in the design and development of City capital improvement projects.
2. Where the Seattle Design Commission is required to review proposals for the design of a project, the Commission shall promote reasonable attempts to include recycled-content products.
3. All City departments shall change their standard specifications to include recycled-content products and materials adopted pursuant to this subchapter.

##### 20.60.224 - Responsibilities of the Director.

The Director is responsible for:


1. Collecting data on purchases by departments of recycled-content products, reusable products, and recyclable products on purchase orders;
2. Maintaining a directory of recycled-content products and recyclable products and vendors who carry these products;
3. Disseminating product information to departments;
4. Developing and establishing rules, guidelines and specifications necessary to carry out these functions.

##### 20.60.226 - Exemptions.

Nothing in this Subchapter III shall be construed as requiring a City department or contractor to procure products that do not perform adequately for their intended end use as specified in Section 20.60.208.

#### 20.84.020 - Applicability.

If the Project or Program receives only City Financial Assistance and no State or Federal Financial Assistance, the provisions of this chapter control. The provisions of the state and federal statutes and regulations may be looked to for guidance in interpreting this chapter.

7. Comparable Replacement Dwelling means a Dwelling that is:

    1. Decent, safe and sanitary as defined in subsection I of this section;
    2. Functionally equivalent to the displacement Dwelling. A functionally equivalent Dwelling performs the same function and provides the same utility. While a Comparable Replacement Dwelling need not possess every feature of the displacement Dwelling, the principal features must be present. Generally, functional equivalency is an objective standard, reflecting the range of purposes for which the various physical features of a Dwelling may be used. In determining whether a replacement Dwelling is functionally equivalent to the displacement Dwelling, a Department may consider reasonable trade-offs for specific features when the replacement unit is equal to or better than the displacement Dwelling. (For examples, see appendix A, 49 CFR § 24.2(a)(6));
    3. In an area not subject to unreasonable adverse environmental conditions;
    4. In a location generally not less desirable than the location of the displacement Dwelling with respect to public utilities and commercial and public facilities, and reasonably accessible to the Displaced Person's place of employment;
    5. On a site that is typical in size for residential development with normal site improvements, including customary landscaping. The site need not include special improvements such as outbuildings, swimming pools, or greenhouses;

        1. A replacement Dwelling purchased by a homeowner in occupancy at the displacement Dwelling for at least 180 days prior to Initiation of Negotiations (a 180-day homeowner) is considered to be within the homeowner's financial means if the homeowner will receive the full price differential, all increased Mortgage interest costs, and all incidental expenses described in Section 20.84.400, plus any additional amount required to be paid for Replacement Housing of Last Resort under Section 20.84.430.
        2. For a Tenant or Owner-occupant who actually and lawfully occupied the displacement Dwelling for at least 90 days prior to the Initiation of Negotiations (a 90-day occupant), a Comparable Replacement Dwelling is considered to be within the Displaced Person's financial means if, after receiving rental assistance pursuant to Section 20.84.410, the Displaced Person's portion of the monthly rent plus average monthly Utility Costs for the replacement Dwelling do not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the Displaced Person's gross monthly Household Income from all sources.
        3. For a Displaced Person who is not eligible to receive a replacement housing payment due to failure to meet the length of occupancy requirements contained in Sections 20.84.400 or 20.84.410, comparable replacement housing is considered to be within the Displaced Person's financial means if, for a period of 42 months, the Department pays that portion of the monthly housing costs for a replacement Dwelling that exceed thirty percent (30%) of the Displaced Person's gross monthly Household Income from all sources. Such payments must be paid under the provisions for Replacement Housing of Last Resort pursuant to Section 20.84.430.
8. Contribute Materially means that during the two taxable years prior to the taxable year in which displacement occurs, or during such other period as the Department determines to be more equitable, a Business or Farm Operation:

    2. Had average annual net earnings of at least $1,000; or
    3. Contributed at least 33% of the Owner's or operator's average annual gross income from all sources.
    4. If the application of the above criteria creates an inequity or hardship in any given case, the Department may approve the use of other criteria it determines appropriate.
9. Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling means a Dwelling that meets the applicable standards in the Housing and Building Maintenance Code, Chapter 22.206, is adequate in size to accommodate the occupants, and, for a Displaced Person with a disability, is free of any barriers that would preclude reasonable ingress, egress, or use of the Dwelling by such Displaced Person.
10. Department means The City of Seattle or any of its subdivisions or instrumentalities, including without limitation, any City office, board, or commission, the City Council and any of its committees, and any public corporation defined in Chapter 3.110, that acquires real property, implements a Project, or conducts a Program (including any Program that provides funding for a Project), that directly causes a Person to become a Displaced Person as defined in this chapter. For purposes of a Project or Program that is not undertaken by a Department, the use of the term "Department" throughout this chapter means "Agency."

2. Ascertain the eligibility for and amount of benefits to be paid each applicant;
3. Give all notices required or authorized to be provided by this chapter;

If, absent this restriction, a Person would be eligible for a payment or assistance under both this chapter and Chapter 22.210, Tenant Relocation Assistance, the Person shall be provided the payments or assistance authorized by this chapter.


#### 20.84.065 - Administration of jointly-funded Projects.

Whenever two or more City Departments provide City Financial Assistance to an entity other than a City Department to carry out functionally or geographically related activities for a Program or Project that will result in a Displaced Person, the City Departments shall by agreement designate the City Department Head for purposes of this chapter.


#### 20.84.075 - Notices—General requirements.

Each notice shall be written in plain, understandable language. Persons who are unable to read and understand the notice must be provided with appropriate translation and counseling as determined by the Department.

Each notice required to be provided to a property Owner or occupant pursuant to this chapter shall either be personally served or sent simultaneously by certified or registered first-class mail, return receipt requested, and by regular first class mail. Proof of delivery or mailing shall be documented and kept in the relocation files.


#### 20.84.085 - Relocation notices.

1. General information notice. As soon as feasible, a Person scheduled to be displaced shall be furnished with a general written description of the relocation program, which description does at least the following:

    1. Informs the Person that the Person may be displaced for the Program or Project and generally describes the relocation payment(s) for which the Person may be eligible, the basic conditions of eligibility, and the procedures for obtaining the payment(s).
    2. Informs the Person that the Person will be given reasonable relocation advisory services, including referrals to replacement properties, help in filing payment claims, and other necessary assistance to help the Person successfully relocate.
    3. Informs the Person that the Person will not be required to move without at least 90 days' advance written notice, and informs any Person to be displaced from a Dwelling that the Person cannot be required to move permanently unless at least one Comparable Replacement Dwelling has been made available.
    4. Describes the Person's right to appeal the Department's determination of a Person's eligibility for, or the amount of, any assistance under this chapter.
2. Relocation eligibility and Notice thereof. Eligibility for relocation assistance begins on the date of a Notice of Intent to Acquire, the Initiation of Negotiations for the occupied property, or the date of actual Acquisition, whichever occurs first. When eligibility begins, the Department shall promptly notify all occupants in writing of their eligibility for applicable relocation assistance.
3. Ninety-day notice.

    1. General. No lawful occupant shall be required to move unless the occupant has received at least 90 days advance written notice of the earliest date by which the occupant may be required to move.
    2. Timing of notice. The Department may issue the notice 90 days before it expects the Person to be displaced or earlier.
    3. Content of notice. The 90-day notice shall either state a specific date as the earliest date by which the occupant may be required to move, or state that the occupant will receive a further notice indicating, at least 30 days in advance, the specific date by which he or she must move. If the 90-day notice is issued before a Comparable Replacement Dwelling is made available, the notice must state clearly that the occupant will not have to move earlier than 90 days after such a Dwelling is made available.
    4. Urgent need. In unusual circumstances, an occupant may be required to vacate the property on less than 90 days advance written notice if the Department determines that a 90-day notice is impracticable, such as when the Person's continued occupancy of the property would constitute a substantial danger to health or safety. A copy of the Department's determination shall be included in the applicable case file.

#### 20.84.095 - Availability of Comparable Replacement Dwelling before displacement.

1. General. No Person to be displaced shall be required to move from his or her Dwelling unless at least one Comparable Replacement Dwelling has been made available to the Person. Where possible, three or more Comparable Replacement Dwellings shall be made available. A Comparable Replacement Dwelling will be considered to have been made available to a Person, if:

    1. The Person is informed of its location;
    2. The Person has sufficient time, based on then existing industry practice, to negotiate and enter into a purchase agreement or lease for the property; and
    3. Subject to reasonable safeguards, the Person is assured of receiving the relocation assistance and acquisition payment to which the Person is entitled in sufficient time to complete the purchase or lease of the property.
2. Circumstances permitting waiver. The Department may grant a waiver of the requirement in subsection A where it is demonstrated that a Person must move because of:

    1. A major disaster defined in 42 U.S.C. § 5122;
    2. A presidentially declared national emergency; or
    3. Another emergency that requires immediate vacation of the real property, such as when continued occupancy of the displacement Dwelling constitutes a substantial danger to the health or safety of the occupants or the public.
3. Basic conditions of emergency move. Whenever a Person to be displaced is required to relocate from the displacement Dwelling for a temporary period because of an emergency described in subsection B of this section, the Department shall:

    1. Take whatever steps are necessary to assure that the Person is temporarily relocated to a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling;
    2. Pay the actual reasonable out-of-pocket moving expenses and any reasonable increase in rent and Utility Costs incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; and
    3. Make available to the Displaced Person as soon as feasible, at least one Comparable Replacement Dwelling. (For purposes of filing a claim and meeting the eligibility requirements for a relocation payment, the date of displacement is the date the Person moves from the temporarily-occupied Dwelling.)

#### 20.84.105 - Relocation planning, advisory services, and coordination.

1. Relocation planning. During the early stages of development, Programs or Projects shall be planned in such a manner that the problems associated with the displacement of individuals, families, Businesses, farms, and Nonprofit Organizations are recognized and solutions are developed to minimize the adverse impacts of displacement. Such planning, where appropriate as determined by the Department, shall precede any action by a Department that will cause displacement, and should be scaled to the complexity and nature of the anticipated displacing activity, including an evaluation of Program resources available to carry out timely and orderly relocations. Planning may involve a relocation survey or study that may include the following:

    1. An estimate of the number of households to be displaced including information such as Owner/Tenant status, estimated value and rental rates of properties to be acquired, family characteristics, and special consideration of the impacts on minorities, the elderly, large families, and Persons with disabilities when applicable.
    2. An estimate of the number of Comparable Replacement Dwellings in the area (including price ranges and rental rates) that are expected to be available to fulfill the needs of those households displaced. When an adequate supply of Comparable Replacement Dwellings is not expected to be available, the Department should consider housing of last resort actions.
    3. An estimate of the number, type, and size of the Businesses, farms, and Nonprofit Organizations to be displaced and the approximate number of employees that may be affected.
    4. An estimate of the availability of replacement business sites. When an adequate supply of replacement business sites is not expected to be available, the impacts of displacing the Businesses should be considered and addressed. Planning for displaced Businesses that are reasonably expected to involve complex or lengthy moving processes or Small Businesses with limited financial resources and/or few alternative relocation sites should include an analysis of business moving problems.
    5. Consideration of any special relocation advisory services that may be necessary and the agencies that will provide them.
2. Relocation assistance advisory services.

    1. General. The Department shall carry out a relocation assistance advisory program that offers the services described in subsection B2 of this section. If the Department determines that a Person occupying property adjacent to the real property acquired for the Program or Project is caused substantial economic injury because of such Acquisition, it may offer advisory services to such Person.
    2. Services to be provided. The advisory program shall include such measures, facilities, and services as may be necessary or appropriate as determined by the Department, to:

        1. Determine, for nonresidential (Businesses, farm and Nonprofit Organizations) displacement, the relocation needs and preferences of each Business, farm and Nonprofit Organization, to be displaced and explain the relocation payments and other assistance for which the Business may be eligible, the related eligibility requirements, and the procedures for obtaining such assistance. This shall include a personal interview with each Business. At a minimum, interviews with displaced Business owners and operators should include the following items:

            1. The Business's replacement site requirements, current lease terms and other contractual obligations and the financial capacity of the Business to accomplish the move.
            2. Determination of the need for outside specialists in accordance with Section 20.84.300 G.12 that will be required to assist in planning the move, assistance in the actual move, and in the reinstallation of machinery and/or other personal property.
            3. For Businesses, an identification and resolution of personalty/realty issues. Reasonable efforts must be made to identify and resolve realty/personalty issues prior to, or at the time of, the appraisal of the property.
            4. An estimate of the time required for the Business to vacate the site.
            5. An estimate of the anticipated difficulty in locating a replacement property.
            6. An identification of any advance relocation payments required for the move, and the Department's legal capacity to provide them.
        2. Determine, for residential displacements, the relocation needs and preferences of each Person to be displaced and explain the relocation payments and other assistance for which the Person may be eligible, the related eligibility requirements, and the procedures for obtaining such assistance. This shall include a personal interview with each residential Displaced Person.

            1. Provide current and continuing information on the availability, purchase prices, and rental costs of Comparable Replacement Dwellings, and explain that the Person cannot be required to move unless at least one Comparable Replacement Dwelling is made available.
            2. As soon as feasible, the Department shall inform the Person in writing of the specific Comparable Replacement Dwelling, the price or rent used for establishing the upper limit of the replacement housing payment, and the basis for the determination, so that the Person is aware of the maximum replacement housing payment for which the Person may qualify.
            3. Where feasible, housing shall be inspected prior to being made available to assure that it meets applicable standards. If such an inspection is not made, the Department shall notify the Person to be displaced that a replacement housing payment may not be made unless the replacement Dwelling is subsequently inspected and determined to be Decent, Safe, and Sanitary.
            4. Whenever possible, minority Persons shall be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwellings that are not located in an area of minority concentration and that are within their financial means. This does not require a Department to provide a Person a larger payment than is necessary to enable a Person to relocate to a Comparable Replacement Dwelling.
            5. The Department shall offer all Persons, transportation to inspect housing to which they are referred.
            6. Any Displaced Person that may be eligible for government housing assistance at the replacement Dwelling shall be advised of any requirements of such government housing assistance program that would limit the size of the replacement Dwelling, as well as of the long term nature of such rent subsidy, and the limited (42 month) duration of the relocation rental assistance payment.
        3. Provide, for nonresidential moves, current and continuing information on the availability, purchase prices, and rental costs of suitable commercial and farm properties and locations. Assist any Person displaced from a Business or Farm Operation to obtain and become established in a suitable replacement location.
        4. Minimize hardships to Persons in adjusting to relocation by providing counseling, advice as to other sources of assistance that may be available, and such other help as may be appropriate by the Department.
        5. Supply Persons to be displaced with appropriate information, as determined by the Department, concerning federal, state and local housing programs, disaster loan and other programs administered by the Small Business Administration, and other federal, state and local programs offering assistance to Displaced Persons, as well as technical help to Persons applying for such assistance.
3. Coordination of relocation activities. Relocation activities shall be coordinated with other Project work so that, to the extent feasible, Persons displaced receive consistent treatment and duplication of functions is minimized.
4. Advisory services for Persons not displaced. Any Person who occupies property acquired by a Department, when such occupancy began subsequent to the Acquisition of the property, and the occupancy is permitted by a short term rental agreement or an agreement subject to termination when the property is needed for a Program or Project, shall be eligible for advisory services, as determined by the Department, even if not eligible for relocation assistance.

#### 20.84.115 - Eviction for cause.

1. Evictions must conform to applicable state and local law. Any Person who lawfully occupies the real property on the date of the Initiation of Negotiations is presumed to be entitled to relocation payments and other assistance set forth in this chapter unless the Department determines that the Person is evicted after the date of Initiation of Negotiations: 1) for cause, 2) pursuant to an eviction notice received by the Person prior to the Initiation of Negotiations, or 3) because a non-residential term lease has ended.
2. In any case an eviction may not be undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to make available the payments and other assistance provided for by this chapter.
3. For purposes of determining eligibility for relocation payments, the date of displacement is the date the Person moves, or the date a Comparable Replacement Dwelling is made available, whichever is later. This section applies only to Persons who would otherwise have been displaced by the Program or Project.

#### 20.84.205 - General requirements—Claims for relocation payments.

1. Documentation. Any claim for a relocation payment shall be supported by such documentation as may be reasonably required by the Department to support expenses incurred, such as bills, certified prices, appraisals, or other evidence of such expenses. A Displaced Person must be provided reasonable assistance necessary to complete and file any required claim for payment.
2. Expeditious payments. The Department shall review claims in an expeditious manner. The claimant shall be promptly notified of any additional documentation required to support the claim. Payment for a claim shall be made as soon as feasible following receipt of sufficient documentation to support the claim.
3. Advance payments. If a Person demonstrates need for an advance relocation payment in order to avoid or reduce a hardship, the Department shall issue the payment, subject to such safeguards as are appropriate as determined by the Department to ensure that the objective of the payment is accomplished.
4. Time for filing.

    1. All claims for a relocation payment shall be filed with the Department within 18 months after:

        1. For Tenants, the date of displacement;
        2. For Owners, the date of displacement or the date of the final payment for the Acquisition of the real property, whichever is later.
    2. The Department may waive this time period for good cause.
5. Notice of denial of claim. If the Department disapproves all or part of a payment claimed or refuses to consider the claim on its merits because of untimely filing or other grounds, it shall promptly notify the claimant in writing of its determination, the basis for its determination, and the procedures for appealing that determination.
6. No waiver of relocation assistance. A Department shall not propose or request that a Displaced Person waive a right or entitlement to relocation assistance and benefits provided by this chapter.
7. Expenditure of payments. Payments provided pursuant to this chapter shall not be considered to constitute City Financial Assistance and do not cause the Person receiving them to be considered a City Project or Program. Accordingly, the requirements of this chapter do not apply to the expenditure of relocation assistance payments by, or for, a Displaced Person.

#### 20.84.215 - Relocation payments not considered income.

1. As provided by state and federal law, no relocation payment received by a Displaced Person as a result of displacement for a program or project with Federal or State Financial Assistance shall be considered income for the purpose of any income tax or any tax imposed under Title 82 RCW or for purposes of determining eligibility or the extent of eligibility of any Person for assistance under state law, the Social Security Act or any other Federal law, except for any Federal law providing low-income housing assistance. Such payments shall not be deducted from any amount to which any recipient would otherwise be entitled under Title 74 RCW.
2. A relocation assistance payment received pursuant to this chapter by a Displaced Person as a result of displacement for a Program or Project shall not be considered income to the extent allowed by state and federal law, and shall not be considered income for purposes of determining eligibility for or the extent of eligibility of any Person for City programs.

#### 20.84.225 - Hearing Examiner appeals.

1. Actions that may be appealed. Whenever a Person believes a Department has failed to properly consider the Person's application for assistance under this chapter or when a Person believes that an Agency has improperly decided an appeal under Section 20.84.640, including but not limited to the Person's eligibility for, the method of determination of, or the amount of a relocation payment required under this chapter, the aggrieved Person may file a written appeal with the Hearing Examiner.

    A non-occupant Owner of a rented Mobile Home is eligible for actual cost reimbursement to relocate the Mobile Home.

#### 20.84.330 - Fixed payment for moving expenses—Nonresidential moves.

1. Business. A displaced Business may be eligible to choose a fixed payment in lieu of the payments for actual moving and related expenses and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses provided by Sections 20.84.300 and 20.84.320. The payment, except for payment to a Nonprofit Organization, shall equal the average annual net earnings of the Business, computed in accordance with subsection E of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. The displaced Business is eligible for the payment if the Department determines that:

    1. The Business owns or rents personal property that must be moved in connection with such displacement and for which an expense would be incurred in such move; and the Business vacates or relocates from its displacement site;
    2. The Business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing patronage (clientele or net earnings). A Business is assumed to meet this test unless the Department determines that it will not suffer a substantial loss of its existing patronage;
    3. The Business is not part of a commercial enterprise having more than three other entities that are not being acquired by the Department, and that are under the same ownership and engaged in the same or similar Business activities;
    4. The Business is not operated at a displacement Dwelling solely for the purpose of renting such Dwelling to others;
    5. The Business is not operated at the displacement site solely for the purpose of renting the site to others; and
    6. The Business Contributed Materially to the income of the Displaced Person.
2. Determining the number of Businesses. In determining whether two or more displaced legal entities constitute a single Business that is entitled to only one fixed payment, all pertinent factors shall be considered, including the extent to which:

    1. The same premises and equipment are shared;
    2. Substantially identical or interrelated business functions are carried out and business and financial affairs are commingled;
    3. The entities are held out to the public, and to those customarily dealing with them, as one Business; and
    4. The same Person or closely related Persons own, control, or manage the affairs of the entities.
3. Farm Operation. A displaced Farm Operation may choose a fixed payment in lieu of a payment for actual moving and related expenses and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses, in an amount equal to its average annual net earnings as computed in accordance with subsection E of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. In the case of a partial Acquisition of land that was a Farm Operation before the Acquisition, the fixed payment shall be made only if the Department determines that:

    1. The Acquisition of part of the land caused the operator to be displaced from the Farm Operation on the remaining land; or
    2. The partial Acquisition caused a substantial change in the nature of the Farm Operation.
4. Nonprofit Organization. A displaced Nonprofit Organization may choose a fixed payment of $1,000 to $20,000 in lieu of the payments for actual moving and related expenses and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses, if the Department determines that it cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of existing patronage (membership or clientele). A Nonprofit Organization is assumed to meet this test unless the Department demonstrates otherwise. Any payment in excess of $1,000 must be supported with financial statements for the two 12-month periods prior to the Acquisition. The amount to be used for the payment is the average of two years annual gross revenues less administrative expenses. (See Appendix A, 49 CFR § 24.305(d).)
5. Average annual net earnings of a Business or Farm Operation. The average annual net earnings of a Business or Farm Operation are one-half of its net earnings before federal, state, and local income taxes during the 2 taxable years immediately prior to the taxable year in which it was displaced. If the Business or farm was not in operation for the full 2 taxable years prior to displacement, net earnings shall be based on the actual period of operation at the displacement site during the 2 taxable years prior to displacement, projected to an annual rate. Average annual net earnings may be based upon a different period of time when the Department determines it to be more equitable. Net earnings include any compensation obtained from the Business or Farm Operation by its Owner, the Owner's spouse, and dependents. The Displaced Person shall furnish the Department proof of net earnings through income tax returns, certified financial statements, or other reasonable evidence the Department determines is satisfactory.

#### 20.84.400 - Replacement housing payment for 180-day homeowner-occupants.

1. Eligibility. A Displaced Person is eligible for the replacement housing payment for a 180-day homeowner-occupant if the Person:

    1. Has actually owned and occupied the displacement Dwelling for not less than the 180 days immediately prior to the Initiation of Negotiations; and
    2. Purchases and occupies a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwelling within one year after the later of the following dates (except that the Department may extend such one year period for good cause):

        1. The date the Displaced Person receives final payment for the displacement Dwelling or, in the case of condemnation, the date the required amount of just compensation is deposited in the court, or
        2. The date the obligation to make a Comparable Replacement Dwelling available is met.
2. Amount of payment. The replacement housing payment for an eligible 180-day homeowner-occupant may not exceed $22,500. The payment is limited to the amount necessary to relocate to a Comparable Replacement Dwelling within one year from the date the displaced homeowner-occupant is paid for the displacement Dwelling, or the date a Comparable Replacement Dwelling is made available to such Person, whichever is later. The payment shall be the sum of:

    1. The amount by which the cost of a replacement Dwelling exceeds the acquisition cost of the displacement Dwelling (price differential), determined in accordance with subsection C of this section; and
    2. The increased interest costs and other debt service costs that are incurred in connection with the Mortgage(s) or other purchase loan on the replacement Dwelling, determined in accordance with subsection D of this section; and
    3. The necessary and reasonable expenses incidental to the purchase of the replacement Dwelling, determined in accordance with subsection E of this section.
3. Price differential.

    1. Basic computation. The price differential to be paid under subsection B1 of this section is the amount that must be added to the acquisition cost of the displacement Dwelling and site to provide a total amount equal to the lesser of:

        1. The reasonable cost of a Comparable Replacement Dwelling determined in accordance with Section 20.84.420; or
        2. The purchase price of the Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwelling actually purchased and occupied by the Displaced Person.
    2. Owner retention of displacement Dwelling. If the Owner retains ownership of his or her Dwelling, moves it from the displacement site, and reoccupies it on a replacement site, the purchase price of the replacement Dwelling shall be the sum of:

        1. The cost of moving and restoring the Dwelling to a condition comparable to that prior to the move; and
        2. The cost of making the unit a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwelling; and
        3. The current market value for residential use of the replacement site, unless the claimant rented the displacement site and there is a reasonable opportunity for the claimant to rent a suitable replacement site; and
        4. The retention value of the Dwelling, if such retention value is reflected in the "acquisition cost" used when computing the replacement housing payment.
4. Increased Mortgage interest costs. The Department shall determine the factors to be used in computing the amount to be paid to a Displaced Person under subsection B2 of this section. The payment for increased Mortgage interest cost shall be the amount that will reduce the balance on a new purchase loan or Mortgage to an amount that could be amortized with the same monthly payment for principal and interest as that for the Mortgage(s) on the displacement Dwelling. In addition, payments shall include other debt service costs, if not paid as incidental costs, and shall be based only on bona fide Mortgages that were valid liens on the displacement Dwelling for at least 180 days prior to the Initiation of Negotiations. Subsections D1 through D5 of this section apply to the computation of the increased Mortgage interest cost payment, which payment shall be contingent upon a Mortgage or other purchase loan being placed on the replacement Dwelling.

    1. The payment shall be based on the unpaid Mortgage balance(s) on the displacement Dwelling; however, in the event the Person obtains a smaller Mortgage or purchase loan than the Mortgage balance(s) computed in the buydown determination, the payment will be prorated and reduced accordingly. In the case of a home equity loan the unpaid balance is the balance that existed 180 days prior to the Initiation of Negotiations or the balance on the date of Acquisition, whichever is less.
    2. The payment shall be based on the remaining term of the Mortgage(s) on the displacement Dwelling or the term of the new Mortgage or purchase loan, whichever is shorter.
    3. The interest rate on the new Mortgage or purchase loan used in determining the amount of the payment shall not exceed the prevailing fixed interest rate for conventional Mortgages currently charged by Mortgage lending institutions in the area in which the replacement Dwelling is located.
    4. Purchaser's points and loan origination or assumption fees, but not seller's points, shall be paid to the extent:

        1. They are not paid as incidental expenses;
        2. They do not exceed rates normal to similar real estate transactions in the area;
        3. The Department determines them to be necessary; and
        4. The computation of such points and fees is based on the unpaid Mortgage balance on the displacement Dwelling, less the amount determined for the reduction of such Mortgage balance under this section.
    5. The Displaced Person shall be advised of the approximate amount of this payment and the conditions that must be met to receive the payment as soon as the facts relative to the Person's current Mortgage(s) are known. The payment shall be made available at or near the time of closing on the replacement Dwelling in order to reduce the new Mortgage or purchase loan as intended.
5. Incidental expenses. The incidental expenses to be paid under subsection B3 of this section or for downpayment assistance under Section 20.84.410 C are those necessary and reasonable costs actually incurred by the Displaced Person incident to the purchase of a replacement Dwelling, and customarily paid by the buyer, including the following costs, but limited to the lesser of the amount actually paid or the amount that would have been paid based on the cost of a Comparable Replacement Dwelling:

    1. Legal, closing, and related costs, including those for title search, preparing conveyance instruments, notary fees, preparing surveys and plats, and recording fees;
    2. Lender, FHA, or VA application and appraisal fees;
    3. Loan origination or assumption fees that do not represent prepaid interest;
    4. Professional home inspection, certification of structural soundness and termite inspection;
    5. Credit report;
    6. Owner's and Mortgagee's evidence of title, e.g., title insurance, not to exceed the costs for a Comparable Replacement Dwelling;
    7. Escrow agent's fee;
    8. State revenue or documentary stamps, sales or transfer taxes (not to exceed the costs for a Comparable Replacement Dwelling); and
    9. Such other costs as the Department determines to be incidental to the purchase.
6. Rental assistance payment for 180-day homeowner. A 180-day homeowner-occupant who could be eligible for a replacement housing payment under subsection A of this section but elects to rent a replacement Dwelling, is eligible for a rental assistance payment not to exceed $5,250, computed and disbursed in accordance with Section 20.84.410.

#### 20.84.410 - Replacement housing payment for 90-day occupants.

1. Eligibility. A Tenant or Owner-occupant displaced from a Dwelling is entitled to a payment not to exceed $5,250 for rental assistance, computed in accordance with subsection B of this section, or down payment assistance, computed in accordance with subsection C of this section, if such Displaced Person:

    1. Has actually and lawfully occupied the displacement Dwelling for at least 90 days immediately prior to the Initiation of Negotiations; and
    2. Has rented, or purchased, and occupied a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwelling within 1 year (unless the Department extends this period for good cause) after:

        1. For a Tenant, the date he or she moves from the displacement Dwelling, or
        2. For an Owner-occupant, the later of:

            1. The date the Owner receives final payment for the displacement Dwelling, or in the case of condemnation, the date the required amount is deposited with the court; or
            2. The date the Owner moves from the displacement Dwelling.
2. Rental assistance payment.

    1. Amount of payment. An eligible Displaced Person who rents a replacement Dwelling is entitled to a payment not to exceed $5,250 for rental assistance. Such payment shall be 42 times the amount obtained by subtracting the base monthly rental for the displacement Dwelling from the lesser of:

        1. The monthly rent and estimated average monthly cost of utilities for a Comparable Replacement Dwelling; or
        2. The monthly rent and estimated average monthly cost of utilities for the Decent, Safe, and Sanitary replacement Dwelling actually occupied by the Displaced Person.
    2. Base monthly rental for displacement Dwelling. The base monthly rental for the displacement Dwelling is the lesser of:

        1. The average monthly cost for rent and utilities at the displacement Dwelling for a reasonable period prior to displacement, as determined by the Department. (For an Owner-occupant, use the market rent for the displacement Dwelling. For a Tenant who paid below market rent for the displacement Dwelling, use the market rent, unless its use would result in a hardship because of the Person's income or other circumstances); or
        2. Thirty (30) percent of the Displaced Person's average monthly gross Household Income if the amount is classified as "low income" by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Annual Survey of Income Limits for the Public Housing and Section 8 programs. The base monthly rental shall be established solely on the criteria in subsection B2a of this section for Persons with income exceeding the survey's "low income" limits, for Persons refusing to provide appropriate evidence of income, as determined by the Department, and for Persons who are dependents. A full time student or resident of an institution may be assumed to be a dependent, unless the Person demonstrates otherwise; or
        3. The total of the amounts designated for shelter and utilities if the Displaced Person is receiving a welfare assistance payment from a program that designates the amounts for shelter and utilities.
    3. Manner of disbursement. A rental assistance payment may, at the Department's discretion, be disbursed in either a lump sum or in installments. However, except as limited by Section 20.84.420 F providing for payments after death, the full amount vests immediately, whether or not there is any later change in the Person's income or rent, or in the condition or location of the Person's housing.
3. Down payment assistance payment.

    1. Amount of payment. An eligible Displaced Person who purchases a replacement Dwelling is entitled to a down payment assistance payment in the amount the Person would receive under subsection B of this section if the Person rented a Comparable Replacement Dwelling. At the discretion of the Department, a down payment assistance payment that is less than $5,250 may be increased to any amount not to exceed $5,250. However, the payment to a displaced homeowner shall not exceed the amount the Owner would receive under Section 20.84.400 if he or she met the 180-day occupancy requirement. If the Department elects to provide the maximum payment of $5,250 as a downpayment, the Department shall exercise this discretion in a uniform and consistent manner, so that eligible Displaced Persons in like circumstances are treated equally. A Displaced Person eligible to receive a payment as a 180-day Owner-occupant under Section 20.84.400 is not eligible for this payment.
    2. Application of payment. The full amount of the replacement housing payment for down payment assistance must be applied to the purchase price of the replacement Dwelling and related incidental expenses.

#### 20.84.420 - Additional rules governing replacement housing payments.

1. Determining cost of Comparable Replacement Dwelling. The upper limit of a replacement housing payment shall be based on the cost of a Comparable Replacement Dwelling.

    1. If available, at least three Comparable Replacement Dwellings shall be examined and the payment computed on the basis of the Dwelling most nearly representative of, and equal to, or better than, the displacement Dwelling. An adjustment shall be made to the asking price of any Dwelling, to the extent justified by local market data. An obviously overpriced Dwelling may be ignored.
    2. If the site of the Comparable Replacement Dwelling lacks a major exterior attribute of the displacement Dwelling Site, (e.g., the site is significantly smaller or does not contain a swimming pool), the value of such attribute shall be subtracted from the acquisition cost of the displacement Dwelling for purposes of computing the replacement housing payment.
    3. If the Acquisition of a portion of a typical residential property causes the displacement of the Owner from the Dwelling and the remainder is a buildable residential lot, the Department may offer to purchase the entire property. If the Owner refuses to sell the remainder to the Department, the market value of the remainder may be added to the acquisition cost of the displacement Dwelling for purposes of computing the replacement housing payment.
    4. To the extent feasible, Comparable Replacement Dwellings shall be selected from the neighborhood in which the displacement Dwelling was located or, if that is not possible, in nearby or similar neighborhoods where housing costs are generally the same or higher.
    5. Multiple occupants of one displacement Dwelling. If two or more occupants of the displacement Dwelling move to separate replacement Dwellings, each occupant is entitled to a reasonable prorated share, determined by the Department, of any relocation payments that would have been made if the occupants moved together to a Comparable Replacement Dwelling. However, if the Department determines that two or more occupants maintained separate households within the same Dwelling, such occupants have separate entitlements to relocation payments.
    6. Deductions from relocation payments. A Department shall deduct the amount of any advance relocation payment from the relocation payment(s) to which a Displaced Person is otherwise entitled. Where such a deduction would not prevent the Displaced Person from obtaining a Comparable Replacement Dwelling, a Department may deduct from relocation payments any rent that the Displaced Person owes the Department. The Department shall not withhold any part of a relocation payment to a Displaced Person to satisfy an obligation to any other creditor.
    7. Mixed-use and multifamily properties. If the Displacement Dwelling was part of a property that contained another Dwelling unit and/or space used for non-residential purposes, and/or is located on a lot larger than typical for residential purposes, only that portion of the acquisition payment that is actually attributable to the displacement Dwelling shall be considered the acquisition cost when computing the replacement housing payment.
2. Inspection of replacement Dwelling. Before making a replacement housing payment or releasing the initial payment from escrow, the Department or its designated representative shall inspect the replacement Dwelling and determine whether it is a Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling.
3. Purchase of replacement Dwelling. A Displaced Person is considered to have met the requirement to purchase a replacement Dwelling, if the Person:

    1. Purchases a Dwelling;
    2. Purchases and rehabilitates a substandard Dwelling;
    3. Relocates a Dwelling which he or she owns or purchases;
    4. Constructs a Dwelling on a site he or she owns or purchases;
    5. Contracts for the purchase or construction of a Dwelling on a site provided by a builder or on a site the Person owns or purchases; or
    6. Currently owns a previously purchased Dwelling and site, valuation of which shall be on the basis of current market value.
4. Occupancy requirements for displacement or replacement Dwelling. No Person shall be denied eligibility for a replacement housing payment solely because the Person is unable to meet the occupancy requirements set forth in this ordinance for a reason beyond his or her control, including:

    1. A disaster, an emergency, or an imminent threat to the public health or welfare, as determined by the President, a federal, state or local agency authorized to make such a determination, or the Department; or
    2. Another reason, such as a delay in the construction of the replacement Dwelling, military duty, or hospital stay, as determined by the Department.
5. Conversion of payment. A Displaced Person who initially rents a replacement Dwelling and receives a rental assistance payment under Section 20.84.410 B is eligible to receive a payment under Section 20.84.400 or Section 20.84.410 C if he or she meets the eligibility criteria for such payments, including purchase and occupancy within the prescribed 1-year period. Any portion of the rental assistance payment that has been disbursed shall be deducted from the payment computed under either of those sections.
6. Payment after death. A replacement housing payment is personal to the Displaced Person and upon his or her death the undisbursed portion of any such payment shall not be paid to the heirs or assigns, except that:

    1. The amount attributable to the Displaced Person's period of actual occupancy of the replacement housing shall be paid.
    2. Any remaining payment shall be disbursed to the remaining family members of the displaced household who continue to occupy the replacement Dwelling in any case in which a member of a displaced family dies.
    3. Any portion of a replacement housing payment necessary to satisfy the legal obligation of an estate in connection with the selection of a replacement Dwelling by or on behalf of a deceased Person shall be disbursed to the estate.
7. Insurance proceeds. To the extent necessary to avoid duplicate compensation, the amount of any insurance proceeds received by a Person in connection with a loss to the displacement Dwelling due to a catastrophic occurrence (fire, flood, etc.) shall be included in the acquisition cost of the displacement Dwelling when computing the price differential.

#### 20.84.430 - Replacement housing of last resort.

1. Determination to provide replacement housing of last resort. Whenever the Department determines that a Program or Project cannot proceed on a timely basis because Comparable Replacement Dwellings are not available within the monetary limits for Owners or Tenants specified in Section 20.84.400 or Section 20.84.410, the Department is authorized to take cost effective measures under the provisions of this section to provide such a Dwelling. The Department's obligation to make available a Comparable Replacement Dwelling shall be met when such a Dwelling, or assistance necessary to provide such a Dwelling, is offered under the provisions of this section. Any decision to provide last resort housing assistance must be adequately justified either:

    1. On a case-by-case basis, for good cause, which means that appropriate consideration, as determined by the Department, has been given to:

        1. The availability of Comparable Replacement Dwellings in the Program or Project area; and
        2. The resources available to provide Comparable Replacement Dwellings; and
        3. The individual circumstances of the Displaced Person; or
    2. By a determination that:

        1. There are few, if any, Comparable Replacement Dwellings available to Displaced Persons within an entire Program or Project area; and, therefore, last resort housing assistance is necessary for the area as a whole; and
        2. A Program or Project cannot be advanced to completion in a timely manner without last resort housing assistance; and
        3. The method selected for providing last resort housing assistance is cost effective, considering all elements that contribute to total Program or Project costs. (For example, will the Project or Program delay justify waiting for less expensive Comparable Replacement Dwellings to become available?)
2. Basic rights of Persons to be displaced. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, no Person shall be required to move from a displacement Dwelling unless comparable replacement housing is available to such Person. No Person may be deprived of any rights the Person may have under this chapter. The Department shall not require any Displaced Person to accept a Dwelling provided by the Department under these procedures (unless the Department and the Displaced Person have entered into a contract to do so) in lieu of any acquisition payment or any relocation payment for which the Person may otherwise be eligible.
3. Methods of providing replacement housing of last resort. The Department shall have broad latitude in implementing this section, but implementation shall be for reasonable cost, on a case-by-case basis unless an exception to case-by-case analysis is justified for an entire Program or Project.

    1. The methods of providing replacement housing of last resort include, but are not limited to:

        1. A replacement housing payment in excess of the limits set forth in Section 20.84.400 or Section 20.84.410. A replacement housing payment under this section may be provided in installments or in a lump sum at the Department's discretion.
        2. Rehabilitation of and/or additions to an existing replacement Dwelling.
        3. Construction of a new replacement Dwelling.
        4. Provision of a direct loan that requires regular amortization or deferred repayment. The loan may be unsecured or secured by the real property. The loan may bear interest or be interest-free.
        5. Relocation and, if necessary, rehabilitation of a Dwelling.
        6. Purchase of land and/or a replacement Dwelling by the Department and subsequent sale or lease to, or exchange with a Displaced Person.
        7. Removal of barriers for Persons with disabilities.
        8. Change in status of the Displaced Person with his or her concurrence from Tenant to homeowner when it is more cost effective to do so, as in cases where a downpayment may be less expensive than a last resort rental assistance payment.
    2. Under special circumstances, consistent with the definition of a Comparable Replacement Dwelling, modified methods of providing replacement housing of last resort permit consideration of replacement housing based on space and physical characteristics different from those in the displacement Dwelling, including upgraded, but smaller replacement housing that is Decent, Safe, and Sanitary and adequate to accommodate individuals or families displaced from marginal or substandard housing with probable functional obsolescence. In no event, however, shall a Displaced Person be required to move into a Dwelling that is not functionally equivalent.
    3. The Department shall provide assistance under this section to a Displaced Person who is not eligible to receive a replacement housing payment under Section 20.84.400 and Section 20.84.410 because of failure to meet the length of occupancy requirement when comparable replacement rental housing is not available at rental rates within the Person's financial means, which is 30 percent of the Person's gross monthly Household Income. Such assistance shall cover a period of 42 months.
4. The actual amount of assistance shall be limited to the amount necessary to relocate to a Comparable Replacement Dwelling within 1 year from the date the displaced homeowner-occupant is paid for the displacement Dwelling or the date the Person is initially offered a Comparable Replacement Dwelling, whichever is later.
5. The Department is not required to provide Persons owning only a fractional interest in the displacement Dwelling a greater level of assistance to purchase a replacement dwelling than the Department would be required to provide such Persons if they owned fee simple title to the displacement Dwelling. If such assistance is not sufficient to buy a replacement Dwelling, the Department may provide additional purchase assistance or rental assistance.

#### 20.84.500 - Relocation assistance—Mobile Homes.

1. Except as otherwise provided by Sections 20.84.510 through 20.84.530, a Person displaced from a Mobile Home and/or mobile home site who meets the basic eligibility requirements of this chapter is entitled to a moving expense payment and a replacement housing payment to the same extent and subject to the same requirements as Persons displaced from conventional Dwellings. Eligible moving cost payments to Persons occupying Mobile Homes are listed in Section 20.84.300 G1—G10.
2. Partial Acquisition of a mobile home park. The Acquisition of a portion of a mobile home park may leave a remaining part of the property that is not adequate to continue the operation of the park. If the Department determines that a Mobile Home located in the remaining part of the property must be moved as a direct result of the Program or Project, the occupant of the Mobile Home shall be considered a Displaced Person who is entitled to relocation payments and other assistance under this chapter.

#### 20.84.510 - Replacement housing payment for 180-day Mobile Homeowner displaced from a Mobile Home, and/or from the acquired Mobile Home site.

1. An Owner-occupant displaced from a Mobile Home or site is entitled to a replacement housing payment, not to exceed $22,500, under Section 20.84.400 if:

    1. The Person occupied the Mobile Home as a Dwelling on the displacement site for at least 180 days immediately before:

        1. The Initiation of Negotiations to acquire the Mobile Home, if the Person owned the Mobile Home and the Mobile Home is real property under state law;
        2. The Initiation of Negotiations to acquire the mobile home site if the Mobile Home is personal property under state law, but the Person owns the mobile home site;
        3. The date of the Department's written notification to the Owner-occupant that the Owner is determined to be displaced from the Mobile Home as described in subsections A3a—d of this section.
    2. The Person meets the other basic eligibility requirements of Section 20.84.400 A; and
    3. The Department acquires the Mobile Home as real estate, or acquires the mobile home site from the displaced Owner, or the Mobile Home used as a Dwelling is personal property under state law but the Owner is displaced from the Mobile Home because the Department determines that the Mobile Home:

        1. Is not and cannot economically be made Decent, Safe, and Sanitary;
        2. Cannot be relocated without substantial damage or unreasonable cost;
        3. Cannot be relocated because there is no available comparable replacement site; or
        4. Cannot be relocated because it does not meet mobile home park entrance requirements.
2. Replacement housing payment computation for a 180-day Owner who is displaced from a Mobile Home. The replacement housing payment for an eligible displaced 180-day Owner is computed as described in Section 20.84.400 B incorporating the following, as applicable:

    1. If the Department acquires the Mobile Home as real estate and/or acquires the Mobile Home site, the acquisition cost used to compute the price differential payment is the actual amount paid to the Owner as just compensation for the Acquisition of the Mobile Home, and/or site, if owned by the displaced mobile homeowner.
    2. If the Department does not purchase the Mobile Home as real estate but the Owner is determined to be displaced from the Mobile Home and eligible for a replacement housing payment based on subsection A1a of this section, the eligible price differential payment for the purchase of a comparable replacement Mobile Home, is the lesser of the displaced mobile homeowner's net cost to purchase a replacement Mobile Home (i.e., purchase price of the replacement Mobile Home less trade-in or sale proceeds of the displacement Mobile Home); or, the cost of the Department selected comparable Mobile Home less the Department's estimate of the salvage or trade-in value for the Mobile Home from which the Person is displaced.
    3. If a comparable replacement mobile home site is not available, the price differential payment shall be computed on the basis of the reasonable cost of a conventional Comparable Replacement Dwelling.
3. Rental Assistance payment for a 180-day Owner-occupant who is displaced from a leased or rented mobile home site. If the displacement mobile home site is leased or rented, a displaced 180-day Owner-occupant is entitled to a rental assistance payment computed as described in Section 20.84.410 B. This rental assistance payment may be used to lease a replacement site; may be applied to the purchase price of a replacement site; or may be applied, with any replacement housing payment attributable to the Mobile Home, to the purchase of a replacement Mobile Home or conventional Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling.
4. Owner-occupant not displaced from the Mobile Home. If the Department determines that a Mobile Home is personal property and may be relocated to a comparable replacement site, but the Owner-occupant elects not to do so, the Owner is not entitled to a replacement housing payment for the purchase of a replacement Mobile Home. However, the Owner is eligible for moving costs described in Section 20.84.300 and any replacement housing payment for the purchase or rental of a comparable site as described in this section or Section 20.84.520 as applicable.

#### 20.84.520 - Replacement Housing Payment for 90-day Mobile Home occupants.

A displaced Tenant or Owner-occupant of a Mobile Home used as a Dwelling and/or site is eligible for a replacement housing payment, not to exceed $5,250, under Section 20.84.410 if:


1. The Person actually occupied the displacement Mobile Home and used it as a Dwelling on the displacement site for at least the 90 days immediately prior to the Initiation of Negotiations;
2. The Person meets the other basic eligibility requirements of Section 20.84.410 A; and
3. The Department acquires the Mobile Home and/or mobile home site, or the Mobile Home is not acquired by the Department but the Department determines that the occupant is displaced from the Mobile Home because of one of the circumstances described in Section 20.84.510 A3.

#### 20.84.620 - Assurances, monitoring and corrective action.

1. Assurances. Before The City approves any grant to, or contract or agreement with an Agency under which City Financial Assistance will be made available for a Program or Project that may result in a Displaced Person under this chapter, the Agency must provide appropriate assurances to the City that it will comply with and be responsible for compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
2. Monitoring and corrective action. The Department Head responsible for the contract is authorized to monitor compliance with this chapter. Upon notice and request from the Department Head, the Agency shall take the corrective action requested or necessary to comply with this chapter.

1. Records. An Agency shall maintain adequate records of its displacement activities in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this chapter. These records shall be retained for at least 3 years after the displacement occurs.
2. Confidentiality of records. Unless otherwise provided by law, records maintained by an Agency in accordance with this chapter are confidential, except that they may be made available to the Department to determine compliance with this chapter.
3. Reports. An Agency shall submit a report of its displacement activities under this chapter when requested by the City Department Head. Normally, such reports will be submitted every 3 years, unless the Department Head requests a report more frequently.

#### 20.84.640 - Agency appeals.

1. Actions that may be appealed.
