### ARTICLE IV - Legislative Department

Section 1. A. LEGISLATIVE POWER, WHERE VESTED: The legislative powers of The City of Seattle shall be vested in a Mayor and City Council, who shall have such powers as are provided for by this Charter; but the power to propose for themselves any ordinance dealing with any matter within the realm of local affairs or municipal business, and to enact or reject the same at the polls, independent of the Mayor and the City Council, is also reserved by the people of The City of Seattle, and provision made for the exercise of such reserved power, and there is further reserved by and provision made for the exercise by the people of the power, at their option, to require submission to the vote of the qualified electors and thereby to approve or reject at the polls any ordinance, or any section, item or part of any ordinance dealing with any matter within the realm of local affairs or municipal business, which may have passed the City Council and Mayor, acting in the usual prescribed manner as the ordinary legislative authority.

B. INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM; HOW EXERCISED; PETITIONS; VERIFICATION OF SIGNATURES; COMPLETION OF PETITION, CONSIDERATION IN COUNCIL: The first power reserved by the people is the initiative. It may be exercised on petition of a number of registered voters equal to not less than ten (10) percent of the total number of votes cast for the office of Mayor at the last preceding municipal election, proposing and asking for the enactment as an ordinance of a bill or measure, the full text of which shall be included in the petition. Prior to circulation for signatures, such petition shall be filed with the City Clerk in the form prescribed by ordinance, and by such officer assigned a serial number, dated, and approved or rejected as to form, and the petitioner so notified within five (5) days after such filing. Signed petitions shall be filed with the City Clerk within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of approval of the form of such petitions. Upon such filing, the City Clerk shall convey the signed petition to the officer responsible for the verification of the sufficiency of the signatures to the petition under state law for such verification, and transmit it, together with his or her report thereon to the City Council at a regular meeting not more than twenty (20) days after the City Clerk has received verification of the sufficiency of such petition signatures from the officer responsible for verification of the sufficiency of signatures under state law, and such transmission shall be the introduction of the initiative bill or measure in the City Council. If the officer responsible for verification of the sufficiency of signatures under state law notifies the City Clerk that any petition, which, upon filing had a sufficient number of signatures, has insufficient verified signatures, the City Clerk shall notify the principal petitioners, and an additional twenty (20) days shall be allowed them in which to complete such petition to the required percentage. Consideration of such initiative petition shall take precedence over all other business before the City Council, except appropriation bills and emergency measures.

C. COUNCIL MAY ENACT OR REJECT BUT NOT MODIFY; COUNCIL MAY PASSSUBSTITUTE: The City Council may enact, or reject, any initiative bill or measure, but shall not amend or modify the same. It may, however, after rejection of any initiative bill or measure, propose and pass a different one dealing with the same subject.

D. WHEN REJECTED MEASURE AND SUBSTITUTE SUBMITTED TO PEOPLE; GENERAL AND SPECIAL ELECTIONS: If the City Council rejects any initiative measure, or shall during forty-five (45) days after receipt thereof have failed to take final action thereon, or shall have passed a different measure dealing with the same subject, the said rejected initiative measure and such different measure dealing with the same subject, if any has been passed, shall be taken in charge by the City Clerk and the City Council shall order the measure submitted to the qualified electors for approval or rejection at the next regularly scheduled election, irrespective of whether it is a state or municipal election or a primary or general election; but the City Council may in its discretion designate submission be at a general election rather than a primary or call an earlier special election.

E. WHEN A SPECIAL ELECTION REQUIRED: If an initiative petition shall be signed by a number of qualified voters of not less than twenty (20) percent of the total number of votes cast for the office of Mayor at the last preceding municipal election, or shall at any time be strengthened in qualified signatures up to said percentage, then the City Council shall provide for a special election upon said subject, to be held within sixty (60) days from the proof of sufficiency of the percentage of signatures.

F. MEASURES ADOPTED TO BECOME ORDINANCES, WHEN: Any measure thus submitted to the vote of the people, which shall receive in its favor a majority of all the votes cast for and against the same, shall become an ordinance, and be in full force and effect from and after proclamation by the Mayor, which shall be made, and published in the City official newspaper, within five (5) days after certification of the results of the election. Provided that if such adopted ordinance contemplates any expenditure which is not included in the current budget, or which is not to be paid from an existing bond issue or which eliminates or reduces an existing revenue; such expenditure or elimination shall not be lawful until after the next succeeding budget shall take effect; Provided, further, that the above restriction shall not be operative when less than Twenty Thousand ($20,000.00) Dollars is involved.

G. SUBMISSION OF SUBSTITUTE AND INITIATIVE MEASURES; IF BOTH APPROVED, THAT HAVING HIGHEST VOTE ADOPTED: In case the City Council shall, after rejection of the initiative measure, have passed a different measure, dealing with the same subject, it shall be submitted at the same election with the initiative measure and the vote of the qualified electors also taken for and against the same, and if both such measures be approved by a majority vote, if they be conflicting in any particular, then the one receiving the highest number of affirmative votes shall thereby be adopted, and the other shall be considered as rejected.

H. POWER OF SIMPLE REFERENDUM AS TO ORDINANCES; EXCEPTIONS; BY PETITION OR BY COUNCIL: The second power reserved by the people is the simple referendum, and it may be exercised and ordered (except as to ordinances necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, or providing for the approval of local improvement assessment rolls, or for the issuance of local improvement bonds), as to any ordinance which has passed the City Council and Mayor (acting in their usual prescribed manner as the ordinary legislative authority of the City), either upon a petition signed by a number of registered voters equal to not less than eight (8) percent of the total number of votes cast for the office of Mayor at the last preceding municipal election, or by the City Council itself without petition.

I. EMERGENCY MEASURES, WHAT TO CONTAIN; VOTE REQUIRED TO PASS: When an emergency exists in which it is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, that an ordinance shall become effective without delay, such emergency and necessity, and the facts creating the same, shall be stated in one section of the bill, and it shall not become an ordinance unless on its final passage by the City Council at least three-fourths (/) of all the members vote in its favor (the vote being taken by yeas and nays, and the names of those voting for and against being entered in the journal), and it shall have been approved by the Mayor, whereupon it shall be of full force and effect.

J. REFERENDUM BY PETITION; EFFECT OF; VERIFICATION OF SIGNATURES: The referendum may be invoked by petition bearing the signatures of the required percentage of qualified voters as to any non-emergency law or ordinance or any section, item or part of any such law or ordinance, which petition shall be filed with the City Clerk before the day fixed for the taking effect of the said law or ordinance, which shall in no case be less than thirty (30) days after the final favorable action thereon by the Mayor and City Council, acting in their usual prescribed manner as the ordinary legislative authority of the City, and the filing of such referendum petition as to any such ordinance or section, item or part thereof, shall operate to suspend the taking effect of the same, or any further action thereon, except as herein provided, viz: The City Clerk shall verify the sufficiency of the signatures to the petition and transmit it, together with his or her report thereon, to the City Council, at a regular meeting not less than twenty (20) days after the filing of the petition.

K. SUBMISSION AT GENERAL OR SPECIAL ELECTION: The City Council shall thereupon provide for submitting the said ordinance or section, item or part thereof, to the vote of the qualified electors for ratification or rejection, either at the next regularly scheduled election, irrespective of whether it is a state or municipal election, or at a sooner special election, as the City Council in its discretion may provide.

L. NOTICE AND CONDUCT OF ELECTION: Official publication shall be made, notices of election given, and the manner and conduct of election, the preparation of the official ballots, the counting and canvassing of the votes, and the certifying of the returns of the election, shall in the exercise of both the initiative and referendum be as provided by law for the submission of propositions to the voters.

M. IF ORDINANCE APPROVED, WHEN TO TAKE EFFECT: If the ordinance thus submitted to the referendum shall receive in its favor a majority of all the votes cast for and against the same, it shall be in full force and effect from and after the proclamation by the mayor, which shall be made and published in the City official newspaper, within five (5) days after the election. Provided, however, that if the ordinance itself shall designate a subsequent date for taking effect, the proclamation shall name the said date as the time for taking effect. If the ordinance shall fail to receive the majority vote in its favor, it shall be considered as rejected and shall be of no force or effect.

N. AMENDMENT OR REPEAL OF INITIATED AND REFERRED ORDINANCES: No ordinance so initiated or referred and approved shall be amended or repealed by the City Council within a period of two (2) years following such approval.
 (As amended at November 6, 1973 election, and at September 15, 1981 election.)

Sec. 2. CITY COUNCIL, MEMBERS: To ensure members of the city council are closer to the people they represent, to enable voters to better know their Councilmembers, and to provide a mixed system of district and at-large representation, the City Council shall consist of nine (9) members, with positions 1 through 7 elected by districts and positions 8 and 9 elected from the City at-large.
