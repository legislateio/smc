It is the specific intent of this subtitle to place the obligation of complying with its requirements upon the owner or operator of the vehicles or upon the pedestrian within its scope, and no provision of nor term used in this subtitle is intended to impose any duty whatsoever upon the City or any of its officers or employees, for whom the implementation or enforcement of this subtitle shall be discretionary and not mandatory. Nothing contained in this subtitle is intended to be nor shall be construed to create or form the basis for any liability on the part of the City, or its officers, employees or agents, for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of the owner or operator of a vehicle or a pedestrian to comply with the provisions of this subtitle, or by reason or in consequence of any act or omission in connection with the implementation or enforcement of this subtitle on the part of the City by its officers, employees or agents.

Whenever any ordinance defining an offense or making conduct unlawful is amended or repealed, whether such amendment or repeal be express or implied, any offense committed, conduct engaged in or penalty or forfeiture incurred while the ordinance was in force shall be punished or enforced as if the ordinance were in force, notwithstanding such amendment or repeal, unless a contrary intention is expressly declared in the amendatory or repealing ordinance, and every such amendatory or repealing ordinance shall be so construed as to save all proceedings under the amended or repealed ordinance pending at the time of the amendatory or repealing ordinance, unless a contrary intention is expressly declared therein.

Separate from the program authorized by Section 11.16.316, the Director of Transportation shall consider requests from employers within an RPZ for employee permits under certain conditions provided that this can be done while maintaining the following goals of the RPZ program: reduce neighborhood traffic impacts by large parking demand generators; support mixed-use neighborhoods and local business districts; continue to reduce overall energy use and vehicle emissions; keep demand by residents and employees from exceeding available on-street parking spaces in residential areas; and implement a customer-oriented permit program. If resident RPZ permits are subsidized in a particular RPZ, an employee is not eligible for such a subsidy. Among the criteria the Director shall consider in determining whether to grant requests for employee RPZ permits are:

    1. Availability of on-street parking on non-RPZ-signed blocks that is within a reasonable walking distance of the employer;
    2. Availability of alternate modes of transportation within a reasonable distance;

    5. Time of day that employees work;
    6. Number of permits requested by the employer;

##### 11.16.316 - Restricted Parking Zone Permits for Use by Businesses

1. The purpose of this section is to authorize the Director of Transportation or his or her designee to administer a specific program for qualified businesses and institutions to apply for and receive restricted parking zone permits to park in a restricted parking zone that have been or may be created in the Initial Segment LINK Light Rail transit station areas, including Rainier Beach, Othello, Columbia City, Mount Baker, Beacon Hill, SODO and Stadium stations. This is in addition to permits issued to qualified residents in these RPZs.
2. The Director of Transportation or his or her designee is authorized to establish rules and regulations for this program, including establishing permit eligibility, application submittal for qualifying businesses and institutions, permit use, and alternate eligibility procedures as needed.
3. In order to be issued a restricted parking permit, the permit holder must be an owner, employee, or volunteer of a business or institution within or adjacent to an RPZ boundary. Property owners for a business or institution within or adjacent to an RPZ boundary can also obtain one permit per owner.
4. Permit holders who violate this section or the RPZ program rules may have their permit revoked and may be excluded from obtaining future permits.
5. The Seattle Department of Transportation shall cease to renew RPZ permits for businesses and institutions in the next RPZ cycle for an RPZ, excluding the SODO and Stadium station RPZs, when any monitoring or surveying of the RPZ indicate that twenty-five (25) percent or more of streets within any particular RPZ have the following conditions: (1) at least seventy-five (75) percent of the capacity of the street available for parking is generally occupied and (2) more than thirty-five (35) percent of the vehicles parked on the street are owned by non-residents of the designated area. In this subsection, the term "non-resident" includes businesses, institutions, and their employees and volunteers located in the area.

##### 11.16.317 - Establishing, expanding and reducing restricted parking zones

1. The Director of Transportation or the Director's designee shall consider whether a restricted parking zone (RPZ) within a designated area, would promote certain benefits or would result in adverse impacts.

    1. Benefits that may lead to establishing an RPZ include, but are not limited to: increased access for area residents, reduced traffic congestion, increased traffic or pedestrian safety, reduced air or noise pollution, reduced commuter parking in neighborhoods, prevention of blighted areas, and promoting the use of alternative modes of transportation.
    2. Adverse impacts that may prevent establishing and RPZ include, but are not limited to: transferring a parking problem to a different area, inability to effectively enforce program restrictions, lack of alternative transportation modes, and availability of simpler, cheaper or more effective solutions.
    3. Regardless of potential benefits or adverse impacts that may result, the Seattle Department of Transportation will not install RPZs in any downtown zone, including all zones contained in Map 1A of Chapter 23.49, in part because of high demand and multiple, competing needs for on-street parking.
2. The Director of Transportation may establish a new or expand an existing restricted parking zone whenever 75 percent or more of the capacity of the streets available for parking on ten contiguous blocks (and/or 20 block faces) in such designated area is generally occupied; over 35 percent of the vehicles parked on the street in the area are not owned by residents of the designated area; a strong and effective community engagement effort indicating that generally stakeholders in the designated area have reviewed and support the restricted parking zone, which could include a petition signed by a majority of the residents in the designated area in support of the restricted parking zone; and the public interest would be served. In cases where the criteria listed above are not met, the Director of Transportation is authorized to establish a restricted parking zone when, in the Director's judgment, the parking problem will be ameliorated by a restricted parking zone and the public interest would be served.
3. The Director of Transportation or the Director's designee is authorized to engage affected and interested community stakeholders to review and assist in refining any future RPZ proposals.

    1. The public information and involvement program may include department presentations to business and community organizations, information distribution through the City's web site, news releases and related media, direct mailings of informational materials, facilitated meetings, sounding boards, walking tours, surveys, and other techniques as appropriate to the scale of the proposal.
    2. Prior to the Director of Transportation's decision to establish, not to establish, to dissolve, to expand, or to reduce an RPZ by more than two contiguous blocks, the Seattle Department of Transportation shall hold a public hearing where it will provide interested persons an opportunity to submit written and spoken comment into the public record.
    3. At least 20 days prior to the public hearing, the Seattle Department of Transportation shall mail a notice of hearing containing the hearing time and location to all owners, commercial lessees and residents of property within 300 feet of the affected restricted parking zone.
    4. At least 20 days prior to the public hearing, the Seattle Department of Transportation shall publish in a local newspaper a notice of the hearing that states the hearing time and location.
4. The Director of Transportation's decision to establish, not to establish, to expand, to reduce, or to dissolve a restricted parking zone is subject to reconsideration within 15 days of publication in a local newspaper. Requests for reconsideration may be initiated, in writing, by residents, business owners, or employees or volunteers in or adjacent to the proposed RPZ. On reconsideration, the Director shall designate a review officer, who shall, after reviewing the reconsideration materials and other relevant information, make a recommendation to the Director. The Director may, at the Director's discretion, stay implementation of a decision pending review. The Director shall have 30 days to issue a Decision. The Director's decision on reconsideration shall be final unless appealed to the Office of the Hearing Examiner under subsection 11.16.317.D.2. Grounds for reconsideration include the validity of any parking study or compliance with the process to establish a zone.

    1. The Director's decision on reconsideration may be appealed to the Hearing Examiner.

        1. Time limit for initiation of an appeal. A notice of appeal shall be filed with the Hearing Examiner within 20 days following issuance of the Director's Decision on Reconsideration.
        2. Form of Appeal. The notice of appeal must contain a brief statement of the issues on appeal, the specific objections to the decision being appealed, along with supporting facts and documentation, and the relief sought. The notice of appeal must list the name of the appellant, and the signature, address, phone number, and fax and e-mail address if available, of the person appealing.
        3. Decision. After reviewing the notice of appeal and supporting documentation and conducting a hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall issue a written decision within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing. The written decision shall contain the reasons for the decision and the provisions for further appeal and shall be provided to the person appealing and to the Director. This decision is the final decision of the City.
5. The Director may modify hours of an existing RPZ or expand or reduce boundaries of an existing RPZ by two contiguous blocks or less by following an administrative process that seeks to identify possible changes suggested by the community, review proposed changes to the RPZ with affected community stakeholders, and make a determination for what best serves the public interest, without holding the public hearing required by subsection 11.16.317.C.2.
6. A restriction of parking shall first take effect on a street segment when it is signed or posted, and shall cease when the signs or posting are removed pursuant to lawful order; provided that vandalism or destruction of parking control signs shall not affect the validity of a restriction upon parking on any street segment designated by the Director of Transportation if other signs or traffic control devices give notice that parking in the street segment is restricted.
7. The Director may initiate dissolution of an RPZ when the Director determines that dissolution best serves the public interest and meets at least one of the following criteria, including but not limited to, low permit sales in a zone, a small number of blocks with RPZ signs, or the absence of the original traffic generator. The zone would be removed at the beginning of a new permit cycle.

##### 11.23.160 - Free-floating car sharing parking

1. A free-floating car sharing parking program is established in order to:

    1. Provide Seattle residents an alternative to personal vehicle ownership, complement the use of public transportation, and reduce personal vehicle ownership, the overall number of car trips and/or vehicle miles traveled within the City, consistent with the City of Seattle's Transportation Strategic Plan;
    2. Achieve emission reduction goals through use of car sharing, as outlined by the City of Seattle's Climate Action Plan;
    3. Achieve curb space priority objectives in commercial districts and residential districts, as outlined by the City of Seattle's Comprehensive Plan; and
    4. Provide low-income access to transportation options.
2. In order to qualify for the free-floating car sharing program as set forth in this Section 11.23.160, all of the following standards must be met:

    1. Permittee must obtain a free-floating car sharing permit for each free-floating car sharing vehicle by paying the free-floating car sharing permit fee to the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT);
    2. Free-floating car sharing vehicles must be parked in the Free-Floating Zone, the area in which the car must be parked at the end of each trip as stated in the permit;
    3. Each free-floating car share vehicle permitted by SDOT shall display a permit and contact information, in a manner determined by SDOT;
    4. Each free-floating car share vehicle must be registered, in a manner determined by SDOT, in Seattle in the free-floating car share program;
    5. Permittee shall comply with the terms of free-floating car sharing permit;
    6. Permittee shall utilize on-street parking within City rights-of-way in compliance with all applicable federal, state, County and City laws and regulations;
    7. Permittee must demonstrate that the free-floating car sharing vehicles have the technical capacity to accurately track each permitted vehicle's actual meter use in paid parking areas, such as GPS or other technology, and provide regular reports to SDOT to verify such use; and
    8. Permittee shall establish a service area for the entire city, as determined by SDOT within their free-floating car sharing permit, within two years of the issue date of the operator's first free-floating car share permit.
3. In 2015, SDOT may issue free-floating car sharing permits to no more than four free-floating car sharing operators. In 2015, each free-floating car sharing operator may receive up to 500 free-floating car share permits, or up to 750 free-floating car sharing permits with the establishment of a service area for the entire city. For subsequent years, SDOT shall determine by Director's Rule the number of permits and operators based on data received as a part of the operator reporting requirements specified in the free-floating car sharing permit. In determining the number of permits and operators, SDOT will consider effects on reductions in personal vehicle ownership, effects on neighborhood business district customer access, whether free-floating car share is sufficiently serving low income communities, and other considerations that affect the public's use of the right of way and travel behavior.
4. SDOT can deny issuance of subsequent permits to the same permittee for either (i) Non-payment of outstanding meter usage fees by permittee pursuant to SMC 11.23.150.C, or (ii) Failure to maintain a service area that serves the entire city.
5. During all hours when it is otherwise lawful to park in specified parking spaces within the Free-Floating Zone, free-floating car sharing vehicles that comply with Section 11.23.160 may park in any of the following parking spaces or stalls: (1) parking spaces or stalls where the posted time limit is one hour or greater, regulated by a parking payment device without displaying a payment receipt and without regard to posted time-limits; (2) time-limited parking spaces or stalls where the posted time limit is one hour or greater, without regard to the posted time; (3) parking spaces or stalls located in any restricted parking zone (RPZ) without regard to time limits imposed on vehicles without RPZ permits; or (4) any other parking space in the public right-of-way not otherwise restricted for exclusive use.
6. Free-floating car sharing vehicles shall be prohibited from parking in the following zones or areas: 1) zones designated as bus zones; 2) car share vehicle zones, unless separately permitted; 3) commercial vehicle load zones; 4) emergency zones; 5) food-vehicle zones; 6) pedestrian zones; 7) roadway construction zones; 8) school loading zones; 9) taxicab, pedicab, and other for-hire car stands; 10) tow-away zones; 11) truck load zones; 12) parking areas adjacent to parking payment device controlled with a service parking meter hood; or 13) any other zone restricted by the Traffic Engineer.
7. Free-floating car sharing vehicles shall be prohibited from parking in a parking space or stall reserved for a person with a disability, unless the member of the free-floating car sharing group utilizing the free-floating car sharing vehicle meets the criteria for special parking privileges under RCW 46.19.010 and the disabled parking permit is displayed as described in RCW 46.19.030 for the duration of the time the free-floating car sharing vehicle is parked within the parking space or stall reserved for a person with a disability.
8. Permittee must provide a report to SDOT at an address specified in the free-floating car sharing permit that provides data showing actual paid parking meter use for each free-floating car share vehicle for the preceding year. The report shall be submitted no later than January 31 of each year. In the event a free-floating car sharing operator's total actual meter use in paid parking areas during the prior permit term exceeds the total paid parking area reimbursement fees required under SMC 11.23.150.C and paid for in the prior permit period, the free-floating car sharing permittee shall reimburse the City for the difference no later than February 28 of each year.
9. SDOT may establish permit conditions and limitations to address neighborhood impacts, equitable access, peak right-of-way usage, or other considerations that affect the public's use of the right of way.

#### Chapter 11.25 - PARADE PERMITS

Sections:

##### 11.25.010 - Purpose and findings.

This Chapter is intended to establish procedures to provide fair and equal access to free speech rights and opportunities to parade in the city, while at the same time preserving the safety of all persons, minimizing disruptions in the orderly and safe circulation of traffic, and avoiding unreasonable risk of injury or damage to parade participants, other persons, and property.

The City Council finds that hazards to participants, vehicles and pedestrians increase when the free flow of traffic is impeded. Such hazards are caused by decreased access for emergency and aid vehicles, an increase in the probability that collisions will occur due to increased traffic density, an increase in obstructions to visibility for pedestrians and vehicles, an increase in hazardous and/or unlawful driving behavior due to driver impatience and an increase in the need for manual traffic control by police officers, among other things. Management of significant traffic congestion requires the use of police resources, which decreases the availability of such police resources for other traffic and police duties. Safety of pedestrians and vehicles, therefore, requires that traffic be safely managed and that the free flow of traffic be facilitated to the fullest extent possible.

The City Council finds that the number of marchers in a roadway affects vehicular and pedestrian traffic safety. An insufficient number of marchers on a roadway that is not readily visible to motorists, or that contains gaps that motorists may try to drive through despite the presence of police officers, creates an unreasonable traffic hazard. In such cases, marchers shall be required to remain on sidewalks while police provide traffic control at intersections. Conversely, a large number of marchers on a sidewalk creates an unreasonable traffic hazard where the number is so large that pedestrians or marchers are forced into lanes of vehicular traffic. In such cases, marchers shall be required to remain in a street or portions thereof while police restrict traffic to such portions, provided that the number of marchers in the street is sufficiently large to avoid an unreasonable traffic hazard.

The City Council finds that pedestrian and vehicular traffic safety relating to the use of streets and sidewalks during a parade depends on factors such as the width of streets, traffic lanes and sidewalks; vehicular speed limits and the known customary vehicle speeds; known traffic hazards or dangerous conditions; normal anticipated vehicular and pedestrian traffic volume at the date, time and place of a proposed parade; the number and location of traffic control devices along the route; whether access to or for emergency vehicles will be obstructed; the number of qualified police personnel necessary and available to control traffic in the surrounding area in order to prevent accidents or injury because of congestion caused by the closure of the street; seasonal weather conditions that may create hazardous conditions; actual weather conditions at the time of the parade; the availability of alternate parade routes, dates or times; and the availability of an adequate number of police personnel without unduly hindering the ability of the Seattle Police Department to provide other necessary police services.


##### 11.25.020 - Definitions.

The following terms, when used in this chapter, shall have the following meanings:

"Application" means a written request to conduct a parade.

"Chief of Police" or "Chief" means the Chief of the Seattle Police Department or the Chief's designated appointee.

"Closure of Streets" means the restriction of vehicular traffic to a roadway or portion thereof, and includes the manual control of traffic at intersections by police or other persons authorized to do so.

"Fixed Point Parade" means a parade in which streets along the entire route are cleared of parked vehicles and traffic in both directions and are controlled by police officers stationed at fixed points along the parade route prior to the starting time of the parade. Parades that include persons on foot along with motorized vehicles, bicycles, floats, animals, or large objects that require more than one person to move and control shall in all cases proceed only as fixed point parades.

"March" means a parade of 50 or more persons on foot, in wheelchairs, or strollers, and does not include the use of motorized vehicles, bicycles, floats, non-domesticated animals including horses, or other large objects that require more than one person to move and control, and is facilitated by mobile police officers on motorcycles, bicycles, on foot or in vehicles who create and maintain a zone of protection around marchers and provide traffic control as they move along the route. "March" includes permitted marches of 50 or more persons on sidewalks with the provision by police officers of traffic control at intersections.

"Marcher" or "marchers" means a person or persons on foot, in wheelchairs or in strollers that participate with the permission of the parade applicant in a march as defined in this section.

Available police personnel means personnel available without unduly hindering the Seattle Police Department from providing other necessary police services.


##### 11.25.030 - Constitutional provisions.

1. No parade permit shall be denied, revoked or modified, and no parade permit restrictions shall be imposed, due in whole or in part, to the contents of statements or viewpoints expressed by the parade participants. The Chief of Police may impose those reasonable and content neutral time, place, and manner restrictions authorized by this ordinance to the extent such restrictions are consistent with the Washington state and United States constitutions.
2. When a parade will include activities that are an exercise of rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, or Article I, Sections 3, 4, 5, or 11 of the Washington Constitution, the application shall be processed promptly, without charging a fee or requiring insurance for the constitutionally protected activities, or imposing terms or conditions that impermissibly infringe constitutional freedoms. The application form shall contain clear and conspicuous language stating that no fee or insurance requirement shall be imposed on any parade that is an exercise of rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, or Article I, Sections 3, 4, 5, or 11 of the Washington Constitution.

##### 11.25.040 - When permit is required.

A parade permit is required for marches of 50 or more persons, or for parades involving motorized vehicles, bicycles, floats, animals or large objects that require more than one person to move and control or for any march conducted in the street or that would require closure of any portion of a public street. No person shall conduct or participate in a parade upon any street or alley in the City without first submitting an application to the Chief of Police and obtaining a permit from the Chief of Police to do so. Upon submitting a written application to the Chief of Police, the Chief of Police shall grant a permit in accordance with this Chapter.

A parade permit is also required for marches that are conducted on sidewalks that also require traffic control at intersections (See SMC 11.25.110). No parade permit is required where marchers remain on sidewalks and obey all traffic signals and laws at intersections. No parade permit is required, nor will one be issued, for any procession of less than 50 persons on foot, in wheelchairs or in strollers. Closure of streets, or a portion thereof, is required whenever the parade includes the use of vehicles, floats, non-domesticated animals or other objects or things whose size or dimensions are incompatible with use on a sidewalk.


##### 11.25.050 - Parade permit applications—Time to submit.

1. Where to apply. A person seeking a parade permit shall submit a written application to the Special Events Committee or to the Chief of Police. Upon receipt of an application for a parade permit, each shall immediately forward the other a copy of the application.
2. General rules.

    1. Marches. Upon the submission of a written application for a parade of 50 persons or more the Chief of Police shall issue a permit on the fifth business day after the submission of a completed application. If an applicant submits a parade permit application less than five business days prior to the requested parade date, the Chief of Police shall issue a permit no later than 24 hours prior to the requested starting time of the parade. In any event, a completed written application for a parade permit for a march shall be delivered to the Chief of Police more than 48 hours before the proposed starting time of the march: Provided, that the 48 hour time limit for the written application shall be waived by the Chief of Police if, at the time the written notice is submitted, the Chief of Police anticipates being able to make reasonable preparations for the march within less time than 48 hours.
    2. Fixed point parades; parades with vehicles, etc. A written application for a parade permit for a fixed point parade or for any parade involving the use of motorized vehicles, bicycles, floats, non-domesticated animals including horses, or other large objects that require more than one person to move and control shall be delivered to the Chief of Police more than 30 days before the proposed date of the parade: Provided, that the 30 day time limit for the written application shall be waived by the Chief of Police if, at the time the written notice is submitted, the Chief of Police anticipates being able to make reasonable preparations for the march within less time than 30 days. The Chief of Police shall issue a parade permit for such parade on or before fourteen calendar days after the submission of a completed application.
3. Rescheduling. The Chief of Police shall issue a parade permit for the date requested unless the proposed parade is proximate in time and place to another previously permitted special event or parade, so that the combined impacts and required public services exceed what the City, after all reasonable efforts have been made to accommodate both events in accordance with the requirements of both the Washington state and United States constitutions, can reasonably provide.
4. When conditions or modifications may be imposed. Terms of parade permits granted under this Section shall be imposed or modified in accordance with this Chapter in order to prevent any unreasonable traffic hazard or when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of persons, property and to ensure the safe conduct of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The Chief of Police shall state in writing the reasons for all modifications and shall provide the statement to the applicant prior to or at the time of issuance of the permit. Where modifications are necessary at the time of or during the parade, the Chief of Police shall state in writing the reasons for all modifications within 24 hours of the end of the parade and shall provide a copy to the applicant upon request.
5. Last-minute parade permits. Because the Seattle Police Department normally requires at least 48 hours to summon qualified personnel to serve on an overtime basis, parade permit applications submitted less than 48 hours before the proposed parade shall be granted only for marches and only if, after making reasonable efforts to identify available Department resources including overtime personnel, such resources are sufficient to prevent an unreasonable traffic hazard without unduly hindering the Department from providing other necessary police services. In such cases, a last-minute parade permit issued under this section shall be issued only under the following circumstances:

    1. The parade is an exercise of rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, or Article I, Sections 3, 4, 5, or 11 of the Washington Constitution.
    2. The parade is a march that does not include motorized vehicles, bicycles, floats, non-domesticated animals including horses or other large objects that require more than one person to move and control. Strollers, hand-pulled wagons and wheelchairs are allowed.
    3. The parade can be conducted in a manner consistent with the policies, terms and conditions set forth in this Chapter so as to prevent any unreasonable traffic hazard.
6. Other permits. If an applicant is required to obtain other permits in accordance with SMC Chapter 15.52 (Crowd Control Events), such written applications must be submitted to the Special Events Committee before the proposed date of the parade in order to ensure consideration by the Special Events Committee of related permits other than a parade permit. The granting of a parade permit pertains only to parades and does not authorize any activity for which a separate permit is required.

##### 11.25.060 - Form of application.

The Special Events Committee shall prescribe a form of application consistent with the requirements of this Chapter. A parade permit application shall be deemed submitted only when a fully completed and executed application form has been received at the office of the Special Events Committee or the Chief of Police. If an application is received that is not fully completed and executed, the application shall not be deemed submitted, and the Special Events Committee or the Chief of Police will send within three business days an oral or written notification to the designated contact person indicated on the application by either telephone contact, voice mail, fax, email or mail.

##### 11.25.080 - Unreasonable traffic hazard.

No parade permit shall allow any route, terms, or conditions that pose an unreasonable traffic hazard to pedestrians, parade participants, vehicles or property. Where an applicant has requested a particular route, terms or conditions that pose such an unreasonable traffic hazard, the Seattle Police Department shall permit alternative dates, times, locations, routes or other terms or conditions that will not present such an unreasonable traffic hazard. The Department shall state in writing the reasons for its determination that the applicant's request would pose an unreasonable traffic hazard.


##### 11.25.090 - Parades prohibited on limited access highways.

No person shall march or participate in any parade or assembly on any limited access highway facility which is open for public travel and no permit will be issued for a parade or assembly thereon.

Nothing in this Chapter is intended to create any liability or responsibility on the part of the Police Department where any person places himself or herself in a dangerous situation in contravention to the directions of police or in violation of the terms of any parade permit.


##### 11.25.110 - Marches - use of streets and sidewalks.

1. Use of streets - minimum number of marchers. The Seattle Police Department shall close portions of the street to vehicular traffic for the purpose of allowing marchers to march in the street only when there is a sufficient number of marchers so that:

    1. The marchers are easily and immediately visible to motorists traveling in the street;
    2. Police are able to close gaps in any group of marchers within the marchers' lanes of travel so as to prevent motorists from attempting to drive through such gaps or around such marchers within the marchers' lane of travel; and
    3. Police are able to keep pedestrians, marchers, vehicles, and police officers in positions that are safe from any undue risk of collision.
2. Factors. In determining the minimum safe number of marchers, the following conditions shall be considered:

    1. The width of streets, traffic lanes, and sidewalks along the proposed route;
    2. The vehicular speed limits and the known customary vehicle speeds along the route;
    3. Known traffic hazards or dangerous conditions along the route;
    4. Normal anticipated vehicular and pedestrian traffic volume at the date, time and place of the proposed march;
    5. The number and direction of traffic lanes;
    6. The number and location of traffic control devices along the route;
    7. Whether access to or for emergency vehicles will be obstructed;
    8. The number of qualified police personnel necessary to control traffic in the surrounding area in order to prevent accidents or injury because of congestion caused by the closure of the street, and whether such qualified police personnel are available without unduly hindering the ability of the Department to provide necessary other police services;
    9. Seasonal weather conditions that may create hazardous conditions;
    10. Actual weather conditions at the time of the parade; and
    11. The availability of alternate parade routes, dates or times.

4. Marches - use of sidewalks. Where the number of marchers is insufficient to conduct a safe march in a street after consideration of the factors in subsection B, above, such march shall be conducted on a sidewalk. Police shall provide a police escort for the march including traffic control at intersections in order to allow marchers to stay together as a single group, provided, however, that police shall not be required to delay cross-traffic on intersecting streets in contravention to traffic signals and stop signs for participants that unreasonably do not remain with the main group of marchers. Police shall state in writing the reasons why the number of marchers is insufficient to conduct a safe march at the time of issuance of the permit. Where placement of marchers on the sidewalk is necessary during a march, police shall document in writing the reasons therefor as soon as practicable and no later than 24 hours after the termination of the march.

##### 11.25.120 - Dangerous or unlawful conduct prohibited.

For purposes of this subsection, conduct that creates a danger to persons or property does not include merely engaging in expressive conduct that is constitutionally protected.

    1. engage in any conduct that creates a danger to persons or property; or
    2. carry, employ, conceal, push, pull or transport any article, object, vehicle, device or other thing that creates a danger to persons or property.

2. Compliance with parade permit. Any person who intentionally fails to comply with the terms of a parade permit may be subject to arrest for any act that would otherwise constitute a violation of law notwithstanding the parade permit. In addition to the violation of specific terms contained in a parade permit, failure to comply with the terms of a parade permit includes, but is not limited to, deviation from the prescribed route without being directed to do so by the police; sitting, standing, lying in any roadway or otherwise remaining in a roadway beyond the time limits set forth in the parade permit; and failure to follow the line of movement at the pace or speed set forth in the parade permit.

##### 11.25.130 - Regularly recurring parades.

1. In cases of conflicting applications for parade permits, regularly recurring parades shall be given a preference for a permit to conduct the parade on or about the regular annual date and customary route in order to protect the expectations and enjoyment of the public. The organizers of any regularly recurring parade shall contact the Special Events Committee no later than six months prior to the anniversary of the last date on which such a regularly recurring parade occurred to indicate the intent to submit an application in the coming year. Any regularly recurring parades for which no intention has been indicated within three months of the proposed parade date shall lose its status as a regularly recurring parade and shall lose any preference. The Special Events Committee shall maintain and make available for public inspection by appointment a list of regularly recurring parades for which an intention has been timely indicated.
2. Where two or more applications are filed purporting to represent the prior organizer of a regularly recurring parade, the Special Events Committee may request those involved to submit documentation to resolve such a conflict. Where the Special Events Committee finds no clear resolution of the conflict, it shall conduct a lottery to select the permittee.

##### 11.25.140 - Denial and modification of specific requests within an application.

The Chief of Police shall not deny a timely submitted parade permit, but may deny or modify specific requests contained in a parade permit application relating to the time, place and manner, including the date, of a parade if:


1. The proposed parade is proximate in time and place to another previously permitted event or parade, so that the combined impacts and required public services exceed what the City, after all reasonable efforts have been made to accommodate both events in accordance with the requirements of both the Washington state and United States constitutions, can reasonably provide;
2. The proposed parade would interfere with already-scheduled or ongoing construction or maintenance work in the immediate vicinity;
3. The proposed parade would create an unreasonable traffic hazard or would unduly compromise the safety of persons, property and vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
4. The proposed parade would unreasonably disrupt the orderly or safe circulation of traffic, would unreasonably disrupt the normal provision of other public services or would present an unreasonable risk of injury or damage to the public;
5. The proposed parade would unreasonably hinder or disrupt the operations of emergency services to the public such as ambulance, fire or police;
6. An emergency, disaster, public calamity or supervening occurrence or other emergency or condition that threatens the public health or safety requires that the parade permit be modified; or
7. The Chief finds that the applicant or the person on whose behalf the application for the permit was made has on prior occasions knowingly made material misrepresentations regarding the nature or scope of an event or activity previously permitted or has violated the terms of prior permits issued to or on behalf of the applicant. Where such a finding is made, the person upon whom such a finding has been made may be substituted by another person as a representative for the applicant. The person upon whom the finding is made may also seek an administrative review of the finding in accordance with SMC 11.25.180.

##### 11.25.150 - Alternative terms; agreement.

If the Chief of Police denies a specific request in a timely submitted parade permit application, he or she shall issue a permit with alternative terms or conditions that are consistent with this Chapter. The Chief shall state in writing the reasons for denying or modifying the requested terms. The Chief or the Special Events Committee may attempt to reach agreement with the applicant on the terms of the permit. Should agreement not be reached, the Chief of Police shall issue a permit as provided in this Chapter, and shall notify the applicant of the applicant's rights to administrative or judicial review as provided in SMC 11.25.180. Nothing in this section requires an applicant to meet, confer with or speak with the Chief of Police. Applicants are also not required to reach agreement with the Chief. An applicant may timely request an administrative review whether or not any attempts at agreement have been made by any party.


##### 11.25.160 - Modification of permit already issued.

The Chief of Police may modify a parade permit already issued if:


1. Conditions that could not have been anticipated at the time the permit was issued require the modification of the parade in order to avoid an unreasonable traffic hazard or would unduly compromise the safety of persons, property and vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
2. When combined with the parade, conditions that could not have been anticipated at the time the permit was issued would unreasonably disrupt the safe circulation of general traffic so as to create an unreasonable traffic hazard;
3. The conditions and circumstances at the time and location of the parade are substantially different than those described in the application and as a result a term or terms of the permit are either unnecessary or inadequate to prevent an unreasonable traffic hazard or to protect the safety of persons, property and vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
4. The parade permit allows vehicles, non-domesticated animals or other such objects but at the time and place designated for the start of the parade, an unreasonable traffic hazard exists or the safety of persons, property and vehicular and pedestrian traffic is unduly compromised because the number of such vehicles, non-domesticated animals or other such objects is either significantly below or significantly above the number allowed by the parade permit; or
5. An unreasonable traffic hazard exists or the safety of persons, property and vehicular and pedestrian traffic is unduly compromised because the applicant unreasonably fails to comply with the terms or conditions contained in the parade permit by the time of the designated start as set forth in the parade permit.
The Chief of Police shall state in writing the reasons for the modifications as soon as practicable, and, if made at the time of or during the parade, no later than 24 hours after the termination of the parade.

3. If the Special Events Committee or the Chief of Police modifies a parade permit, the Chief of Police or the Special Events Committee shall send prompt written notice explaining the reasons and advising the applicant of the applicant's rights to administrative or judicial review as provided in SMC 11.25.180. If the modification occurs less than four days before the scheduled parade, the Chief of Police shall also make reasonable efforts to notify the parade organizer in the most timely manner (such as telephone, e-mail, or other electronic communication). A record shall be kept of each attempt to contact the applicant.
4. The Chief of Police or the Special Events Committee may modify a parade permit less than 24 hours before the scheduled start of the parade only to avoid an unreasonable traffic hazard, or where the safety of persons, property and vehicular and pedestrian traffic is unduly compromised, or where any of the circumstances described in Subsection A of this Section arise at the time of or during the parade. No prior written notification is required if any such modification of a parade permit is made at the time and place of the parade, provided that the Chief of Police shall orally inform the applicant of the reasons for the modification. The Chief of Police shall promptly make a written report of the modifications and the reasons for the modifications and shall make a copy of such report available to the applicant as soon as practicable and no later than 24 hours after the termination of the parade.

##### 11.25.180 - Administrative Review.

Where a parade permit has been issued more than seven days prior to the starting time of the parade, an applicant may seek an administrative review of any terms of a permit by submitting a written request for an appeal to the Special Events Administrative Review Committee established under SMC 15.52.060 D. Requests for an administrative appeal must be submitted to the Special Events Administrative Review Committee at least seven business days prior to the requested date of the parade. Upon receipt of a timely submitted request, the Administrative Review Committee shall convene at an open public meeting to consider the request and render a decision within seven days but in any event no later than two business days prior to the requested starting time. The Administrative Review Committee may modify the permit consistent with this Chapter. Thereafter, an applicant may appeal the decision of the Administrative Review Committee to a court of competent jurisdiction. If an applicant has not or is unable to timely submit a written request to the Administrative Review Committee, the applicant may appeal directly to a court of competent jurisdiction at any time after the seventh business day prior to the requested parade.


##### 11.25.190 - Application and administrative review forms.

Applications for parade permits and requests for administrative review shall be made on forms approved of and provided by the Chief of Police. All application and administrative review request forms shall be provided in a single packet to any parade permit applicant free of charge upon request to the Seattle Police Department or the Coordinator of the Special Events Committee.

For the purposes of this subsection, "owner's agent" means the legal owner of the vehicle, a driver in possession of the vehicle with the registered owner's permission, or an adult member of the registered owner's family; a person who is determined and verified by the operator to have the permission of the registered owner of the vehicle; or a person who has purchased the vehicle from the registered owner, who produces proof of ownership or authorization and signs a receipt therefore. A person redeeming a vehicle impounded pursuant to Section 11.30.105 must prior to redemption establish that he or she has a valid driver's license and is in compliance with Section 11.20.340. A vehicle impounded pursuant to Section 11.30.105 can be released only pursuant to a written release authorization from the Seattle Police Department pursuant to Section 11.30.120 C or a written release authorization or order from Municipal Court pursuant to Section 11.30.120 B or C.
2. Any person so redeeming a vehicle impounded by the City shall pay the towing contractor for costs of impoundment (removal, towing, and storage) and administrative fee prior to redeeming such vehicle. Such towing contractor shall accept payment as provided in RCW 46.55.120(1)(b), as now or hereafter amended. If the vehicle was impounded pursuant to Section 11.30.105 and was being operated by the registered owner when it was impounded, it may not be released to any person until all penalties, fines, or fees owed by the registered owner to the City of Seattle have been satisfied by payment in full, by establishment of a time payment agreement with the Municipal Court, or by other means acceptable to the Municipal Court. If the vehicle was impounded pursuant to Section 11.30.040.A.7, it may not be released to any person until all penalties, fines, or fees on all parking infractions described in that section, and all booting, removal, towing, storage, lost boot, and administrative fees charged against the vehicle and owed by the registered owner to the City of Seattle have been satisfied by payment in full or through a time payment plan. Upon payment in full or time payment arrangement of such obligations, the court may issue a written release authorization allowing the vehicle to be released from impoundment.
3. The Chief of Police or Municipal Court shall release a vehicle impounded pursuant to Section 11.30.105 prior to the expiration of any period of impoundment:

    1. Upon petition of the spouse of the driver, or the person registered pursuant to Ordinance 117244 as the domestic partner of the driver, based on economic or personal hardship to such spouse or domestic partner resulting from the unavailability of the vehicle and after consideration of the threat to public safety that may result from release of the vehicle, including, but not limited to, the driver's criminal history, driving record, license status, and access to the vehicle; or
    2. If the registered owner of the vehicle was not the driver, did not know that the driver's license was suspended or revoked and has not received a prior release under this Subsection 11.30.120 C2 or Subsection 11.30.040 A9.
In order to avoid discriminatory application, the Chief of Police and Municipal Court shall deny release without discretion in all circumstances other than for the reasons set forth in this Subsection 11.30.120 C. If such release is authorized, the person redeeming the vehicle still must satisfy the requirements of Section 11.30.120 A and B.


1. Any person seeking to redeem a vehicle impounded as a result of a parking or traffic citation or under Section 12A.10.115 has a right to a hearing before a Municipal Court judicial officer to contest the validity of an impoundment or the amount of removal, towing, and storage charges or administrative fee if such request for hearing is in writing, in a form approved by the Municipal Court and signed by such person, and is received by the Municipal Court within ten (10) days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of the latter of the date the notice was mailed to such person pursuant to Section 11.30.100 A or B, or the date the notice was given to such person by the registered tow truck operator pursuant to RCW 46.55.120(2)(a). Such hearing shall be provided as follows:

    1. If all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including expiration of any period of impoundment under Section 11.30.105, have been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall be released immediately, and a hearing as provided for in Section 11.30.160 shall be held within ninety (90) days of the written request for hearing.
    2. If not all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including expiration of any period of impoundment under Section 11.30.105, have been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall not be released until after the hearing provided pursuant to Section 11.30.160, which shall be held within two (2) business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the written request for hearing.
    3. Any person seeking a hearing who has failed to request such hearing within the time specified in Section 11.30.120 D may petition the Municipal Court for an extension to file a request for hearing. Such extension shall only be granted upon the demonstration of good cause as to the reason(s) the request for hearing was not timely filed. For the purposes of this section, "good cause" shall be defined as circumstances beyond the control of the person seeking the hearing that prevented such person from filing a timely request for hearing. In the event such extension is granted, the person receiving such extension shall be granted a hearing in accordance with this chapter.
    4. If a person fails to file a timely request for hearing and no extension to file such a request has been granted, the right to a hearing is waived, the impoundment and the associated costs of impoundment and administrative fee are deemed to be proper, and the City shall not be liable for removal, towing, and storage charges arising from the impoundment.
    5. In accordance with RCW 46.55.240 (1)(d), a decision made by a Municipal Court judicial officer may be appealed to Municipal Court for final judgment. The hearing on the appeal under this subsection shall be de novo. A person appealing such a decision must file a request for an appeal in Municipal Court within fifteen (15) days after the decision of the Municipal Court judicial officer and must pay a filing fee in the same amount required for the filing of a suit in district court. If a person fails to file a request for an appeal within the time specified by this section or does not pay the filing fee, the right to an appeal is waived and the Municipal Court judicial officer's decision is final.

##### 11.30.160 - Post-impoundment hearing procedure.

Hearings requested pursuant to Section 11.30.120 shall be held by a Municipal Court judicial officer, who shall determine whether the impoundment was proper and whether the associated removal, towing, storage, and administrative fees were proper. The Municipal Court judicial officer shall not have the authority to determine the commission or mitigation of any parking infraction unless a timely response under Section 11.31.050 A was filed to that notice of infraction requesting a hearing and the hearing date for that infraction has not passed, in which case the Municipal Court judicial officer has discretion to consolidate the impoundment hearing and the notice of infraction hearing.


1. At the hearing, an abstract of the driver's driving record is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the status of the driver's license, permit, or privilege to drive and that the driver was convicted of each offense shown on the abstract. In addition, a certified vehicle registration of the impounded vehicle is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the identity of the registered owner of the vehicle.
2. If the impoundment is found to be proper, the Municipal Court judicial officer shall enter an order so stating. In the event that the costs of impoundment (removal, towing, and storage) and administrative fee have not been paid or any other applicable requirements of Section 11.30.120 B have not been satisfied or any period of impoundment under Section 11.30.105 has not expired, the Municipal Court judicial officer's order shall also provide that the impounded vehicle shall be released only after payment to the City of any fines imposed on any underlying traffic or parking infraction and satisfaction of any other applicable requirements of Section 11.30.120 B and payment of the costs of impoundment and administrative fee to the towing company and after expiration of any period of impoundment under Section 11.30.105. In the event that the Municipal Court judicial officer grants time payments for the costs of impoundment and administrative fee, the City shall be responsible for paying the costs of impoundment to the towing company. The Municipal Court judicial officer shall grant such time payments only in cases of extreme financial need, and where there is an effective guarantee of payment.
3. If the impoundment is found to be improper, the Municipal Court judicial officer shall enter an order so stating and order the immediate release of the vehicle. If the costs of impoundment and administrative fee have already been paid, the Municipal Court judicial officer shall enter judgment against the City and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment and administrative fee in the amount of the costs of the impoundment and administrative fee.
4. In the event that the Municipal Court judicial officer finds that the impound was proper, but that the removal, towing, storage, or administrative fees charged for the impoundment were improper, the Municipal Court judicial officer shall determine the correct fees to be charged. If the costs of impoundment and administrative fee have been paid, the Municipal Court judicial officer shall enter a judgment against the City and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment and administrative fee for the amount of the overpayment.
5. No determination of facts made at a hearing under this section shall have any collateral estoppel effect on a subsequent criminal prosecution and such determination shall not preclude litigation of those same facts in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
6. An appeal of the Municipal Court judicial officer's decision in Municipal Court shall be conducted according to, and is subject to, the procedures of this section. If the court finds that the impoundment or the removal, towing, storage, or administrative fees are improper, any judgment entered against the City shall include the amount of the filing fee.

##### 11.30.180 - Responsibility for fees as to standby time or vehicles held for investigatory purposes.

1. No fee shall be assessed against the owner of a vehicle for time elapsed after the towing equipment has arrived at the location of the vehicle to be towed and prior to the operation of the towing equipment or performance of the impound service.
2. No impoundment fee and/or towing or storage charges shall be assessed against the owner of a vehicle which is being held for investigatory purposes pursuant to Section 11.30.040 A6 and which is redeemed within forty-eight (48) hours after the Police Department shall have notified the owner of the release of such vehicle in writing in the manner provided in Section 11.30.100 C; provided that such owner or person authorized to obtain possession of such impounded vehicle shall pay any charges assessed for storage after such forty-eight (48) hour period; provided further, that if the registered owner or the driver authorized by the registered owner is arrested or charged with a crime in connection with the incident leading to impoundment, the City shall not pay the towing or storage charges.

##### 11.30.200 - Abandoned vehicles.

1. Any impounded vehicle not redeemed within fifteen (15) days of mailing of the notice required by Section 11.30.100 shall be deemed abandoned.
2. No tow truck operator shall sell or otherwise dispose of an abandoned vehicle unless all applicable provisions of State law have been complied with.

The Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall audit such claim and any payment thereof at least once annually. A warrant or warrants for payment of such claim shall be drawn and paid by the Director from such expenditure allowances as may be provided therefor in the annual budget or from such moneys as may otherwise be appropriated for such purpose.

"Immobilize" means the use of a locking wheel boot that, when attached to the wheel of a vehicle, prevents the vehicle from moving without damage to the tire to which the locking wheel boot is attached.
2. A violation of this section is a gross misdemeanor. (RCW 46.55.300)

##### 11.30.360 - Violations constituting abandoning—Evidence—Penalty.

##### 11.31.090 - Traffic infractions detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera

Timely mailing of this statement to the peace officer relieves a rental car business of any liability under Chapter 11.31 for the notice of infraction.


1. A notice of infraction based on evidence detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera must be mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle within 14 days of the violation, or to the renter of a vehicle within 14 days of establishing the renter's name and address under subsection C1 of this section, SMC 11.31.090. The peace officer issuing the notice of infraction shall include with it a certificate or facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images produced by an automated traffic safety camera, stating the facts supporting the notice of infraction. This certificate or facsimile is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in it and is admissible in a proceeding charging a violation of Section 11.50.140, Section 11.50.150, Section 11.52.040, or Section 11.52.100. The photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images evidencing the violation must be available for inspection and admission into evidence in a proceeding to adjudicate the liability for the infraction.
2. A person receiving such a notice of infraction may respond to the notice by mail. The registered owner of a vehicle is responsible for such an infraction unless the registered owner overcomes the presumption in SMC subsection 11.31.090.E, or, in the case of a rental car business, satisfies the conditions under SMC subsection 11.31.090.C. If appropriate under the circumstances, a renter identified under SMC subsection 11.31.090.C1 is responsible for such an infraction.
3. If the registered owner of the vehicle is a rental car business, the peace officer shall, before such a notice of infraction is issued, provide a written notice to the rental car business that a notice of infraction may be issued to the rental car business if the rental car business does not, within 18 days of receiving the written notice, provide to the peace officer by return mail:

    1. A statement under oath stating the name and known mailing address of the individual driving or renting the vehicle when the infraction occurred; or
    2. A statement under oath that the business is unable to determine who was driving or renting the vehicle at the time the infraction occurred; or
    3. In lieu of identifying the vehicle operator, the rental car business may pay the applicable penalty.
4. The term "automated traffic safety camera" means a device that uses a vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction with an intersection traffic control system, a railroad grade crossing system or speed measuring device, and a camera synchronized to automatically record one or more sequenced photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images of the rear of a motor vehicle at the time the vehicle fails to stop when facing a steady red traffic control signal or an activated railroad grade crossing control signal or exceeds a speed limit in a school speed zone as detected by a speed measuring device. An automated traffic safety camera includes a camera used to detect violations other than stoplight, railroad crossing and school speed zone violations as authorized by and subject to the restrictions imposed by the Washington Legislature.
5. In a traffic infraction case involving an infraction detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera, proof that the particular vehicle described in the notice of traffic infraction was in violation of Section 11.50.140, Section 11.50.150, 11.52.040, or Section 11.52.100, together with proof that the person named in the notice of traffic infraction was at the time of the violation the registered owner of the vehicle, constitutes in evidence a prima facie presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person in control of the vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, the violation occurred. This presumption may be overcome only if the registered owner states, under oath, in a written statement to the court or in testimony before the court that the vehicle involved was, at the time, stolen or in the care, custody, or control of some person other than the registered owner.

#### Chapter 11.35 - IMMOBILIZATION

Sections:

##### 11.35.010 - Scofflaw list

1. When there are four or more parking citations issued against a vehicle for each of which a person has failed to respond, failed to appear at a requested hearing, or failed to pay amounts due for at least 45 days from the date of the filing of each of those citations, the Seattle Municipal Court shall place the vehicle on a list of scofflaws, and shall mail, by first class mail, a notice to the last known registered owner of the vehicle, as disclosed by the vehicle license number as provided by the Washington State Department of Licensing or equivalent vehicle licensing agency of the state in which the vehicle is registered. If there is no last known address that can be ascertained from the Washington Department of Licensing, or if the vehicle has no Washington vehicle license number or is not registered in the State of Washington, the notice, in the form of a readily visible notification sticker, may be affixed to the vehicle while left within a public right-of-way or other publicly owned or controlled property. A notification sticker may be used in lieu of mailing even if the last known address is ascertainable for vehicles registered in the State of Washington.
2. The registered vehicle owner may request an administrative review at the Seattle Municipal Court at any time that the vehicle is on the scofflaw list until the vehicle has been immobilized or impounded. The review should only examine whether the vehicle is properly on the scofflaw list and shall not review the underlying citations that caused the vehicle to be included on the scofflaw list. The vehicle shall be removed from the list only upon a showing by the registered owner that either:

    1. fewer than four of the citations that caused the vehicle to be included on the scofflaw list were committed while the current registered owner was the legal owner of the vehicle; or
    2. all amounts due pertaining to the citations that met the criteria for scofflaw under Section 11.35.010 A have been satisfied in full.
3. A vehicle shall remain on the scofflaw list until all outstanding parking infraction penalties, court costs (including but not limited to collection agency remuneration authorized under RCW 3.02.045), default penalties on parking traffic infractions imposed under Section 11.31.120, immobilization release fees imposed under subsection 11.35.020.H, costs of impoundment (including removal, towing and storage fees) imposed under Section 11.30.120, towing administrative fees imposed under Section 11.30.290 and immobilization administrative fees under subsection 11.35.020.H, and interest, have been paid, or a time payment plan has been arranged with the Seattle Municipal Court or their authorized agent.
4. When a time payment plan is created, the subject vehicle shall be temporarily removed from the scofflaw list and the payment amounts shall be applied on a pro rata basis until all penalties, fines or fees owed relating to all parking citations are satisfied. A vehicle that has been temporarily removed from the scofflaw list shall be returned to the list if the owner defaults on the time payment agreement, in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Seattle Municipal Court.

##### 11.35.020 - Immobilization

1. Effective July 1, 2011 and thereafter, if the notice requirements under Section 11.35.010 A have been met, and if parked in public right-of-way or on other publicly owned or controlled property, a vehicle on the scofflaw list may be immobilized by installing on such vehicle a device known as a "boot," which clamps and locks onto the vehicle wheel and impedes vehicle movement. If a vehicle is immobilized, it shall not be released until full payment has been made, or a time payment agreement has been entered into for all outstanding penalties, fines, or fees owed for all parking citations, plus all immobilization, towing, and storage charges and administrative fees.
2. Any vehicle that remains booted for 48 hours or more, not including any of the 48 hours from the beginning of Saturday until the end of Sunday, or which becomes illegally parked while booted, shall be subject to towing and impoundment pursuant to Section 11.30.040. The Seattle Department of Transportation and Seattle Police Department shall issue joint guidelines for vehicle towing related to immobilization, based on Sections 11.30.040 and 11.16.320.
3. The person installing the boot shall leave under the windshield wiper or otherwise attach to the vehicle a notice advising the owner that the vehicle has been booted by the City of Seattle for failure to respond, failure to appear at a requested hearing, and failure to pay amounts due for four or more adjudicated parking infractions for at least 45 days from the date of the last such adjudication issued against the vehicle; that release of the boot may be obtained by paying all outstanding penalties, fines, or forfeitures owed relating to all adjudicated violations, plus all booting, removal, towing, and storage charges and administrative fees; that unless such payment is made within two business days of the date of the notice, the vehicle will be impounded; that it is unlawful for any person to remove or attempt to remove the boot, to damage the boot, or to move the vehicle with the boot attached, unless authorized by the Seattle Police Department or an authorized agent of the City; and that the owner may seek an administrative review of the booting by submitting a request to the Seattle Municipal Court within ten days of the release of the boot. The notice shall further state that the vehicle remains subject to impoundment regardless of whether the owner requests an appeal.
4. The vehicle may be released from immobilization when the vehicle owner or an agent of the owner pays all outstanding parking infraction penalties, court costs (including but not limited to collection agency remuneration authorized under RCW 3.02.045), default penalties on parking traffic infractions imposed under Section 11.31.120, immobilization release fees imposed under subsection 11.35.020.H, costs of impoundment (including removal, towing and storage fees) imposed under Section 11.30.120, towing administrative fees imposed under Section 11.30.290 and immobilization administrative fees under subsection 11.35.020.H, and interest, or enters into a time payment agreement for the payment thereof. Upon full payment or upon entry into a time payment agreement, the Seattle Police Department or other authorized agent of the City shall promptly remove or enable the removal of the boot from the vehicle. If payment is made in full, the vehicle shall be removed from the scofflaw list and shall not be subject to immobilization or impoundment for the paid citations. Upon entry into a time payment agreement, the vehicle shall be temporarily removed from the scofflaw list and shall not be subject to immobilization, provided, however, that the vehicle shall be returned to the scofflaw list and be subject to immobilization if the owner defaults on the time payment agreement. A registered owner who defaults on a time payment agreement shall not be given another opportunity to make a time payment arrangement and therefore, payment for all outstanding amounts above shall be made in full before the vehicle may be removed from the scofflaw list or released from immobilization or impound. Any person who has previously removed or enabled removal of a booting device in violation of subsection E while on the scofflaw list for any four or more parking infractions, and subsequently is booted a second time while on the scofflaw list for the same parking infractions, shall not be eligible for a time payment plan.
5. No person other than an authorized employee of the Seattle Police Department or an authorized agent of the City shall remove or enable the removal of the boot described in subsection A of this Section from any vehicle on which it has been installed unless the requirements of subsection D have been met.
6. If the Seattle Police Department or an authorized agent of the City enables the vehicle owner to remove the boot, the owner shall return the boot to a location designated by the Department within two calendar days of the removal.
7. No person, other than an authorized employee of the Seattle Police Department or other authorized agent of the City, shall move, by towing or other means, any vehicle after it has been immobilized but before the boot has been removed.
8. The Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall determine and set an immobilization fee and an administrative fee in amounts such that the sum of such fees do not exceed the sum of the lowest impound fee, minimum storage fee, and administrative fee for vehicle impoundment under Section 11.30.120. An administrative fee, if any, shall be levied when the boot is removed. The administrative fee shall be collected by the contractor releasing the vehicle from immobilization, shall be remitted to the Department of Finance and Administrative Services, and shall be deposited in an appropriate account.
9. A person who fails to return the booting device within the time frame required by subsection F of this section may be charged a late fee as determined by the Director of Finance and Administrative Services.
10. A person who intentionally damages the booting device may be charged a replacement fee as determined by the Director of Finance and Administrative Services and also may be prosecuted for the crime of property destruction under section 12A.08.020.
11. The Director of Finance and Administrative Services shall adopt rules governing the imposition of fees under this Section 11.35.020.

##### 11.35.030 - Post-immobilization review

The registered vehicle owner may seek a post-deprivation review of the immobilization by submitting a written request to the Seattle Municipal Court within ten days of the placement of the notice on the vehicle, as established by the notice date. Upon timely receipt of such written request, the Seattle Municipal Court shall, within a reasonable time as established by the Court, conduct a review on the issue of whether the immobilization was proper and shall issue a written decision setting forth the reasons on which the decision is based, provided, however, that any previously adjudicated parking infractions that formed the basis of the vehicle's scofflaw status shall not be subject to the review. The person seeking review shall have an opportunity to present evidence on his or her behalf in accordance with requirements established by the Court.

In addition to any nonsuspendable and nondeferrable jail sentence required by this subsection 11.56.025.I, whenever the court imposes less than 364 days in jail, the court shall also suspend but shall not defer a period of confinement for a period not exceeding five years. The court shall impose conditions of probation that include: (1) not driving a motor vehicle within this state without a valid license to drive; (2) not driving a motor vehicle within this state without proof of liability insurance or other financial responsibility for the future pursuant to Section 11.20.340; (3) not driving or being in physical control of a motor vehicle within this state while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more or a THC concentration of 5.00 nanograms per milliliter of whole blood or higher within two hours after driving or being in physical control; (4) not refusing to submit to a breath or blood test to determine alcohol or drug concentration upon request of a law enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe the person was driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within this state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug; and (5) not driving a motor vehicle in this state without a functioning ignition interlock device as required by the Washington Department of Licensing.

The court shall notify the Washington State Department of Licensing of a person's violation of any mandatory condition of probation imposed under this subsection 11.56.025.I and the suspension of or extension of the suspension, revocation, or denial of a person's license, permit, or privilege to drive. The court may impose conditions of probation that include nonrepetition, installation of an ignition interlock device on the probationer's motor vehicle, alcohol or drug treatment, supervised probation, or other conditions that may be appropriate, including attendance at an educational program, such as a victim impact panel meeting the minimum standards established under RCW 10.01.230, focusing on the emotional, physical, and financial suffering of victims who were injured by persons convicted of driving while under the influence of intoxicants.

The fee shall be collected by the clerk of the court and distributed according to RCW 46.61.5054.
11. A court may waive the electronic home monitoring requirements of this section when (1) the offender does not have a dwelling, telephone service, or any other necessity to operate an electronic home monitoring system. However, if a court determines that an alcohol monitoring device utilizing wireless reporting technology is reasonably available, the court may require the person to obtain such a device during the period of required electronic home monitoring; (2) the offender does not reside in the State of Washington; or (3) the court determines that there is reason to believe that the offender would violate the conditions of the electronic home monitoring penalty. Whenever the mandatory minimum term of electronic home monitoring is waived, the court shall state in writing the reason for granting the waiver and the facts upon which the waiver is based, and shall impose an alternative sentence with similar punitive consequences. The alternative sentence may include, but is not limited to, use of an ignition interlock device, the 24/7 sobriety program monitoring, additional jail time, work crew, or work camp. Whenever the combination of jail time and electronic home monitoring or alternative sentence would exceed three hundred sixty-four (364) days, the offender shall serve the jail portion of the sentence first, and the electronic home monitoring or alternative portion of the sentence shall be reduced so that the combination does not exceed three hundred sixty-four (364) days.
12. The court shall require any person convicted of an alcohol-related violation of Subsection 11.56.020 A or B to comply with the rules and requirements of the Washington Department of Licensing regarding the installation and use of a functioning ignition interlock device installed on all motor vehicles operated by the person. If the court orders that a person refrain from consuming any alcohol, the court may order the person to submit to alcohol monitoring through an alcohol detection breathalyzer device, transdermal sensor device, or other technology designed to detect alcohol in a person's system.

The parking brakes shall be capable of being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements by the driver's muscular effort or by spring action or by equivalent means. The operation of parking brakes may be assisted by the service brakes or other source of power; provided, that failure of the service brake actuation system, or other power assisting mechanism, will not prevent the parking brakes from being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements. The parking brakes shall be so designed that when once applied, they shall remain applied with the required effectiveness, despite exhaustion of any source of energy or leakage of any kind. The same brake drums, brake shoes and lining assemblies, brake-shoe anchors and mechanical brake shoe actuation mechanism normally associated with the wheel brake assemblies may be used for both the service brakes and the parking brakes. If the means of applying the parking brakes and the service brakes are connected in any way, they shall be so constructed that failure of any one (1) part shall not leave the vehicle without operative brakes.
3. Brakes on All Wheels. Every vehicle shall be equipped with brakes acting on all wheels except:

    1. Trailers, semitrailers, or pole trailers of a gross weight not exceeding three thousand (3,000) pounds, provided that:

        1. The total weight on and including the wheels of the trailer or trailers shall not exceed forty percent (40%) of the gross weight of the towing vehicle when connected to the trailer or trailers; and
        2. The combination of vehicles consisting of the towing vehicle and its total towed load, is capable of complying with the performance requirements of Section 11.84.040.
    2. Trailers, semitrailers, or pole trailers manufactured and assembled prior to July 1, 1965, shall not be required to be equipped with brakes when the total weight on and including the wheels of the trailer or trailers does not exceed two thousand (2,000) pounds.
    3. Any vehicle being towed in drive-away or tow-away operations, provided the combination of vehicles is capable of complying with the performance requirements of Section 11.84.040.
    4. Trucks and truck-tractors having three (3) or more axles need not have brakes on the front wheels, except that when such vehicles are equipped with at least two (2) steerable axles, the wheels of one (1) steerable axle need not have brakes. However, such trucks and truck-tractors must be capable of complying with the performance requirements of Section 11.84.040.
    5. Special mobile equipment as defined in Section 11.14.840.
    6. The wheel of a sidecar attached to a motorcycle or to a motor-driven cycle, or the front wheel of a motor-driven cycle need not be equipped with brakes, provided that such motorcycle or motor-driven cycle is capable of complying with the performance requirements of Section 11.84.040.

6. Trailer Air Reservoirs Safeguarded. Airbrake systems installed on trailers manufactured or assembled after January 1, 1964, shall be so designed that the supply reservoir used to provide air for the brakes shall be safeguarded against backflow of air from the reservoir through the supply line.
7. Two (2) Means of Emergency Brake Operation.

    1. Air Brakes. Every towing vehicle, when used in other than drive-away or tow-away operations to tow another vehicle (trailer) equipped with air-controlled brakes, shall be equipped with two (2) means for emergency application of the trailer brakes. One (1) of these means shall apply the trailer brakes automatically in the event of a reduction of the towing vehicle's air supply to a fixed pressure. The fixed pressure shall be not lower than twenty (20) pounds per square inch, nor higher than forty-five (45) pounds per square inch. The other means of applying the trailer brakes shall be a manually controlled device for applying and releasing of the brakes, readily operable by a person seated in the towing vehicle's driving seat; and its emergency position or method of operation shall be clearly indicated. In no instance may the manual means of operation of trailer brakes be so arranged as to permit its use to prevent operation of the automatic means of applying trailer brakes. The automatic and the manual means of operation of trailer brakes required by this section may be, but are not required to be, separate.
    2. Vacuum Brakes. Every towing vehicle used to tow other vehicles equipped with vacuum brakes, in operations other than drive-away or tow-away operations, shall have, in addition to the single control device required by subsection H, a second control device which can be used to operate the brakes on towed vehicles in emergencies. The second control shall be independent of brake air, hydraulic and other pressure, and independent of other controls, unless the braking system be so arranged that failure of the pressure upon which the second control depends will cause the towed vehicle brakes to be applied automatically. The second control is not required to provide modulated braking.
8. Single Control to Operate All Brakes. Every motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer and pole trailer, and every combination of such vehicles, except motorcycles and motor-driven cycles, equipped with brakes shall have the braking system so arranged that one (1) control device can be used to operate all service brakes. This requirement does not prohibit vehicles from being equipped with an additional control device to be used to operate brakes on the towed vehicles. This regulation does not apply to drive-away or tow-away operations unless the brakes on the individual vehicles are designed to be operated by a single control in the towing vehicle.
9. Reservoir Capacity and Check Valve.

    1. Air Brakes. Every bus, truck or trucktractor with air-operated brakes shall be equipped with at least one (1) reservoir sufficient to insure that, when fully charged to the maximum pressure as regulated by air compressor governor cut-out setting, a full service brake application may be made without lowering such reservoir pressure by more than twenty percent (20%). Each reservoir shall be provided with means for readily draining accumulated oil or water.
    2. Vacuum Brakes. Every truck with three (3) or more axles equipped with vacuum assistor type brakes and every truck-tractor and truck used for towing a vehicle equipped with vacuum brakes shall be equipped with a reserve capacity or a vacuum reservoir sufficient to insure that, with the reserve capacity or reservoir fully charged and with the engine stopped, a full service brake application may be made without depleting the vacuum supply by more than forty percent (40%).
    3. Reservoir Safeguarded. All motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers and pole trailers, when equipped with air or vacuum reservoirs or reserve capacity as required by this section, shall have such reservoirs or reserve capacity so safeguarded by a check valve or equivalent device that in the event of failure or leakage in its connection to the source of compressed air or vacuum, the stored air or vacuum shall not be depleted by the leak or failure.
10. Warning Devices.

    1. Air Brakes. Every bus, truck or trucktractor using compressed air for the operation of its own brakes or the brakes on any towed vehicle, shall be provided with a warning signal, other than a pressure gauge, readily audible or visible to the driver, which will operate at any time the air reservoir pressure of the vehicle is below fifty percent (50%) of the air compressor governor cut-out pressure. In addition, each such vehicle shall be equipped with a pressure gauge visible to the driver, which indicates in pounds per square inch the pressure available for braking.
    2. Vacuum Brakes. Every truck-tractor and truck used for towing a vehicle equipped with vacuum-operated brakes and every truck with three (3) or more axles using vacuum in the operation of its brakes, except those in drive-away or tow-away operations, shall be equipped with a warning signal, other than a gauge indicating vacuum, readily audible or visible to the driver, which will operate at any time the vacuum in the vehicle's supply reservoir or reserve capacity is less than eight inches (8") of mercury.
    3. Combination of Warning Devices. When a vehicle required to be equipped with a warning device is equipped with both air and vacuum power for the operation of its own brakes or the brakes on a towed vehicle, the warning devices may be, but are not required to be, combined into a single device which will serve both purposes. A gauge or gauges indicating pressure or vacuum shall not be deemed to be an adequate means of satisfying this requirement. (RCW 46.37.340)
