2. Provide information, assistance, supplies, and the use of equipment as necessary and appropriate to community advisory councils;
3. Make facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department available for use by ARC for programs and activities for the general public at charges or rentals which allow for the benefit provided to the Department thereby and grant preference in the usage of such facilities for such programs and activities for the general public over requests by other persons or groups for uses that are not open to the general public;
4. Include information concerning ARC programs for the general public in information and publicity provided to the public as to Departmental operations and/or activities and events occurring at its facilities, and encourage members of the general public to participate in ARC member advisory councils as a way of expressing opinions and guiding Departmental and ARC policy and activities at Departmental facilities; and
5. Contract with ARC to provide recreation and lifelong learning programs and other services and to serve such other functions as ARC and the Superintendent may from time to time agree may be necessary or helpful in expanding educational and recreational opportunities for Seattle residents, and, in so doing, increase public use and enjoyment of Department facilities and improve its overall responsiveness to the public; engage ARC to recognize community advisory councils on behalf of the Superintendent and to provide management services for, coordinate and support its member community advisory councils; and, in recognition of the role played by ARC, support ARC through the provision of information, assistance, services, equipment and office space in Department facilities, all as more specifically provided in the Master Services Agreement (called "MSA" in this chapter).
6. In consultation with ARC, call upon ARC and the community advisory councils from time to time for assistance in other matters that further the programs and activities of the Department; all as the Superintendent shall deem appropriate and generally as provided in the MSA for the purpose of increasing educational and recreational opportunities for Seattle residents, providing greater public use and enjoyment of the City's park and recreation system and establishing a variety of activities, and, through a sound system of accounts and records, preserving public confidence in programs and activities offered at City facilities.

## Chapter 18.12 - PARKS CODE

Sections:

### Subchapter I - General Provisions
#### 18.12.010 - Citation.

This chapter shall constitute the Parks Code of the City and may be cited as such.


#### 18.12.020 - Police power.

This chapter is declared to be an exercise of the police power of the City, and its provisions shall be liberally construed for the preservation and protection of the natural environment, public peace, health, safety and welfare.


#### 18.12.025 - Purpose and findings.

The City of Seattle finds as follows, and declares that the ordinance codified in this section is passed in response to the following facts:


1. Unlawful and inappropriate behavior in the City's parks diminishes these precious assets and deprives citizens of the full use and enjoyment of the natural beauty, recreational opportunities and peaceful repose that parks are intended to preserve in an urban setting.
2. In addition to more serious criminal acts that threaten personal injury and property damage, a wide range of illegal disorderly behavior can transform a park into an unwelcoming, unattractive and ultimately unsafe public space requiring increased expenditures for public safety and maintenance.
3. The laws intended to preserve and protect the parks for the benefit of all are effective only if those who use the parks obey the law. The current criminal and civil penalties for violating the law are frequently inadequate alone to deter illegal behavior, prevent its recurrence or provide for the removal of the offender from the park.
4. Compliance with the law, including the Parks Code and regulations, will be enhanced by the immediate administrative sanction of excluding from a park those who violate the law. In addition, for repeat offenders and for more serious offenses, exclusion for extended periods of time will provide a necessary additional remedy to protect the parks.
5. Due to the geographic proximity of some parks, the similarity of some park functions and the potential displacement of illegal behavior from one park to another, it is necessary to provide for exclusion from groups of parks or all parks under certain circumstances.

#### 18.12.030 - Definitions—Rules of construction.

        2. A City park that is not included in a City park zone defined in subsection A5a is itself a City park zone.

    12. "Superintendent" means the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation of the City and authorized agents of the Superintendent, who may include, without limitation, the Chief of Police of The City of Seattle and his or her subordinate officers, Seattle animal control officers, and staff of the Department of Parks and Recreation.
    13. "Superintendent's Hearing Officer" means the individual who is the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation and each person or panel of persons on whom the Superintendent has conferred responsibility to conduct the hearing authorized in Section 18.12.278 E.

#### 18.12.045 - Terms and conditions.

If an applicant asserts that a term or condition proposed by the Superintendent infringes upon a constitutional right, the Superintendent shall have the burden of showing that the proposed term or condition is a reasonable restriction on the time, place and manner of exercising the right and is valid.


#### 18.12.047 - Refund of deposits and fees.

The offender need not be charged, tried, or convicted of any crime or infraction in order for an exclusion notice to be issued or effective. The exclusion may be based upon observation by the Superintendent or upon the sort of civilian reports that would ordinarily be relied upon by police officers in the determination of probable cause.


1. The Superintendent may, by delivering an exclusion notice in person to the offender, exclude from a City park zone or zones, anyone who within a City park:

    1. Violates any provision within this chapter; or
    2. Violates any park rule as defined in Section 18.12.030; or
    3. Violates any provision of the Seattle Municipal Code or Revised Code of Washington.
2. If the offender:

    1. Has not been excluded from any City park zone by an exclusion notice issued within one (1) year prior to the violation and the current violation is not a felony violation or weapon violation, then the Superintendent may exclude the offender from the City park zone in which the current violation occurred for a period not exceeding seven (7) days from the date of the exclusion notice;
    2. Has been the subject of only one (1) prior exclusion notice issued within one (1) year prior to the current violation and neither the current nor the past violation was a felony violation or weapon violation, then the Superintendent shall exclude the offender from the City park zone in which the current violation occurred for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the exclusion notice;
    3. Has been the subject of two (2) or more prior exclusion notices issued within one (1) year prior to the current violation, all from the same City park zone in which the current violation occurred, or if the current violation is a felony violation or weapon violation, then the Superintendent shall exclude the offender from the City park zone in which the current violation occurred for a period of one (1) year from the date of the exclusion notice;

5. An offender receiving an exclusion notice longer than seven (7) days may seek a hearing before the Superintendent's Hearing Officer to have the exclusion notice rescinded or the period of exclusion shortened. The request for a hearing shall be delivered to the Superintendent's Hearing Officer or postmarked no later than seven (7) days after the issuance date of the exclusion notice. The request for hearing shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by a copy of the exclusion notice on which the hearing is sought.

The offender shall be responsible for serving any subpoena issued at the offender;s request.
7. At the hearing, the violation must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence in order to uphold the exclusion notice. If the exclusion notice was issued because of the alleged violation of any criminal law, the offender need not be charged, tried, or convicted for the exclusion notice to be upheld. The exclusion notice establishes a prima facie case that the offender committed the violation as described. The Superintendent's Hearing Officer shall consider a sworn report or a declaration under penalty of perjury as authorized by RCW 9A.72.085, written by the individual who issued the exclusion notice, without further evidentiary foundation. The certifications authorized in Rule 6.13 of the Criminal Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction shall be considered without further evidentiary foundation. The Superintendent's Hearing Officer may consider information that would not be admissible under the evidence rules in a court of law but which the Superintendent's Hearing Officer considers relevant and trustworthy.
8. If the violation is proved, the exclusion notice shall be upheld; but upon good cause shown, the Superintendent's Hearing Officer may shorten the duration of the exclusion. If the violation is not provided by a preponderance of the evidence, the Superintendent's Hearing Officer shall rescind the exclusion. If the Superintendent's Hearing Officer rescinds an exclusion, the exclusion shall not be considered a prior exclusion for purposes of Seattle Municipal Code Section 18.12.278 B.
9. The decision of the Superintendent's Hearing Officer is final. An offender seeking judicial review of the Superintendent's Hearing Officer's decision must file an application for a writ of review in the King County Superior Court within fourteen (14) days of the date of that decision.
10. The exclusion shall remain in effect during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding.
11. No determination of facts made by a person conducting a hearing under this section shall have any collateral estoppel effect on a subsequent criminal prosecution or civil proceeding and shall not preclude litigation of those same facts in a subsequent criminal prosecution or civil proceeding.
12. This section shall be enforced so as to emphasize voluntary compliance with laws and park rules, and so that inadvertent minor violations that would fall under subsection B1 of this section can be corrected without resort to an exclusion notice.

A waiver or reduction from the established fees for special promotional or marketing purposes shall comply with the following five (5) criteria:

    1. The waiver or reduction of the fee shall accord with sound management practices for municipal facilities of like character. It shall fulfill a declared objective furthering a departmental purpose such as acquainting the public with the facility or the service provided by the department thereby establishing or broadening public usage; reaching out to people who would not otherwise make use of the facility; or securing advertising, services or other benefits from a sponsor or those attending.
    2. The promotion and the fee waiver or reduction shall appear appropriate to the City's facility. It should avoid the appearance of a City endorsement or approval of a private product, service, or activity; the use of public facilities for electoral purposes prohibited by RCW 42.17.130; or the granting of special privileges to a particular portion of the populace.
    3. The promotion and attendance under the waiver or lower charge shall respect the use and enjoyment of the facility by people paying the established fee. In addition, those attending under the promotion should have an opportunity to use and enjoy the facility, without overcrowding.

    5. The opportunity to sponsor an arrangement under conditions set forth in Exhibit B, shall be made available to individuals, associations, and businesses, similarly situated, on an equal basis, in accord with and subject to the Superintendent's rules.
2. The circumstances when waivers or reduced fees are available shall be defined by rules promulgated by the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation pursuant to the Administrative Code, Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 3.02.

### 18.28.030 - Waiver of fees for individuals or groups.

1. The Superintendent of Parks and Recreation may waive or reduce an entry or use fee contained in the established fee schedule for an organization, association, group of individuals, or an individual, and authorize the supervisor of a facility to do so, irrespective of any special promotion or event whenever:

    1. Such a waiver vindicates a constitutional right guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution through its Fourteenth Amendment or Article I, Section 3 of the Washington Constitution;
    2. The user, including but not limited to departmental advisory councils or societies organized to assist the Woodland Park Zoo or the Aquarium, the conservatory in Volunteer Park, the Arboretum at Washington Park, or horticultural areas provides services or assistance to the Department in lieu of the fee that would otherwise apply, or provides in-kind services or leaves improvements to the facility that offset the reduced fee revenue;
    3. The user is poor or infirm or is a charitable organization assisting the poor or infirm, and charging the fee would have the effect of depriving the individual of reasonable access to the facility or of opportunity to participate in a public event, and would cause hardship or directly reduce the assistance such organization provides to the poor or infirm;
    4. The user is an organization serving the public or the community, lacks its own facility as a result of a calamity or other temporary distress, and there is a perceived moral obligation toward the organization or its members at a moment of crisis;
    5. Another government requests use of the facility for a public purpose; or the use is granted under a reciprocal use of facilities agreement with another municipal government;
    6. Free admission to the facility furthers a departmental purpose, e.g., the person is a volunteer for a department-sponsored or co-sponsored event, participates in an athletic event for public spectators, or enters in connection with a work assignment or to assist a concessionaire or as a parent or guardian to assist the Department in the instruction or care of a minor or ward;
    7. The entry is under authority of law (e.g., governmental inspectors, law enforcement officers, officials with subpoenas who act in the scope and course of their duties) or under a contract right or privilege; or
    8. In the opinion of the Superintendent, the waiver or reduction is in the overall public interest due to extraordinary facts or circumstances.
2. In determining whether a fee should be waived or reduced, the Superintendent shall be guided by the benefit to the public and the Department when granting the request, the frequency and amount of usage requested, the effect on and fairness to other users, its consistency with policies underlying the fee schedule and this chapter, and the consequences of denying the request.

### 18.28.040 - Experimental rates.

1. With the concurrence of the City Budget Director, the Superintendent of Parks and Recreation is authorized to adjust the fee or charge contained in the established fee schedule for any particular facility on a temporary basis of up to 60 days in order to increase public attendance or usage and the resulting revenues. Temporary rates may take the form of special price during a special time, e.g., a half-price rate for entry to a park facility during the final hour before closing, a lower rate for children when half or more of the allotted time for family or children's usage has expired, or a two for one entry for a handicapped individual and a person who accompanies and assists a handicapped individual.
2. The Superintendent shall report to the City Council in conjunction with the presentation of the Department's proposed budget, the Department's experience with any experimental rates during the preceding 12 months.

### 18.30.020 - Violation of chapter

It is a violation of Title 18, subject to enforcement under Chapter 18.30, for any person to:


1. Engage in any unauthorized use of park property or dumping on park property;
2. Remove or deface any sign, notice, complaint or order required by or posted in accordance with Title 18;
3. Misrepresent any material fact in any application, plans or other information submitted to obtain any permit or authorization to use or dump on park property;
4. Fail to comply with the requirements of Title 18.

### 18.30.024 - Authority to enforce

1. The Superintendent is authorized to enforce Title 18. The Superintendent may call upon the police, fire, health or other appropriate City departments or government agencies to assist in enforcement.
2. The Superintendent may enter any park property at any time to perform the duties imposed by Title 18. If necessary, the Superintendent will obtain the consent of the owner or occupier of a building or premises or obtain a lawfully issued inspection warrant to enter buildings or premises that are owned by the Department of Parks and Recreation, but leased to or being used by a private entity.
3. Title 18 shall be enforced for the benefit of the health, safety and welfare of the general public and the parks system, and not for the benefit of any particular person or class of persons.
4. It is the intent of Title 18 to place the obligation of complying with its requirements upon the adjacent property owner, occupant or other person responsible for the unauthorized use of park property. The abatement of an unauthorized use and restoration of park property is still the responsibility of the responsible party currently benefitting from the encroachment or unauthorized use, even if the unauthorized use may have been installed or created by a previous owner or other responsible party.
5. No provision of or term used in Title 18 is intended to impose any duty upon the City or any of its officers or employees that would subject them to damages in a civil action.

### 18.30.028 - Investigation and notice of violation

1. The Superintendent is authorized to investigate any use of a park property that the Superintendent reasonably believes does not comply with the requirements of Title 18.
2. If after investigation the Superintendent determines that Title 18 has been violated, the Superintendent may issue a notice of violation to the adjacent property owner, occupant or other responsible party. The notice of violation shall briefly describe each violation; state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply with Title 18; and set a reasonable time for compliance, not to exceed 90 days. Compliance may be achieved by abating an unauthorized use and restoring the park property, or by applying for and obtaining a permit for the use.
3. The notice shall be served upon the adjacent property owner, occupant or other responsible party, by personal service as provided by RCW 4.28.080 for service of a summons, or sent by first class mail, addressed to the last known address of such person(s) and posted at a conspicuous place on the site. Service shall be complete at the time of personal service; or if mailed, three days following the date of mailing.
4. Nothing in this section shall limit or preclude any action or proceeding pursuant to Section 18.30.032, Stop Work Orders, and nothing in this section shall obligate or require the Superintendent to issue a notice of violation prior to the imposition of civil penalties.
5. A notice of violation may be amended at any time to:

    1. Correct clerical and other errors, or
    2. Cite additional authority for a stated violation.
6. Unless a request for review is made according to Section 18.30.044, the notice of violation shall become the final order of the Superintendent. After the notice of violation becomes the final order of the Superintendent, a copy of the notice of violation may be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections.

### 18.30.032 - Stop Work Orders

1. The Superintendent may issue a Stop Work Order to halt:

    1. An ongoing unauthorized use of park property that creates a substantial risk of injury to persons, park property, utilities serving the park property and/or park improvements, or impairs the Superintendent's ability to obtain compliance with Title 18; or
    2. Dumping on park property.
2. The Superintendent shall post the Stop Work Order at a conspicuous place on the site and, if possible, serve a copy upon a person doing or responsible for the activity. Once the Superintendent posts the Stop Work Order, all unauthorized use and dumping in the park shall cease immediately.
3. The Stop Work Order shall state the activity or unauthorized use being stopped and the basis of the Stop Work Order. The Stop Work Order may require the responsible party to correct the violation or hazard that prompted the Stop Work Order and restore the affected park property.
4. A person aggrieved by a Stop Work Order of the Superintendent has five working days after the Stop Work Order is posted to request reconsideration from the Superintendent. The request for reconsideration must be in writing, and shall include any objections and evidence supporting the request for reconsideration. Within five working days after receiving a request, the Superintendent shall make a decision, in writing, as to whether the Stop Work Order shall remain in force and mail a copy of the decision to the requestor by first-class mail. The decision of the Superintendent upon reconsidering the matter is final. No decision to impose or continue a Stop Work Order may give rise to a claim for damages. The Stop Work Order shall remain in effect pending reconsideration. The Superintendent may record the Stop Work Order with the King County Recorder's Office.
5. A responsible party who fails to comply with a Stop Work Order is subject to penalties as provided by Section 18.30.050.

### 18.30.036 - Time to comply

When calculating a reasonable time for compliance, the Superintendent shall consider the following:


1. The type and degree of violation cited in the notice;
2. The stated intent, if any, of an adjacent property owner, occupant or other responsible party to take steps to comply;
3. The procedural requirements for obtaining a permit;
4. The complexity of the corrective action; and
5. Any circumstances beyond the control of the adjacent property owner, occupant or other party responsible for the violation.

### 18.30.040 - Extension of compliance date

The Superintendent may grant an extension of time for compliance with any notice or Order, not to exceed 90 days, whether pending or final, upon the Superintendent's finding that substantial progress toward compliance has been made and that the public will not be adversely affected by the extension.

The Superintendent may rescind an extension of time if it is shown that the conditions at the time the extension was granted have changed, the Superintendent determines that a party is not performing corrective actions as agreed, or if the extension creates an adverse effect on the public. Notice rescinding the extension date shall be mailed to all responsible parties via first class mail and the compliance date shall then be three days after mailing the notice.


### 18.30.044 - Review by the Superintendent

1. Any person aggrieved by a notice of violation issued by the Superintendent pursuant to SMC 18.30.028 may obtain a review of the notice by requesting such review in writing within 10 days of the date of the notice. When the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day. Within 30 days of the request for review, the aggrieved person shall submit any additional information to be considered for the review. Before the deadline for submitting information, any person aggrieved by or interested in the notice of violation may submit any additional information in the form of written material to the Superintendent for consideration as part of the review.
2. The review will be made by a representative of the Superintendent who is familiar with the case and the applicable ordinances. The Superintendent's representative will review all additional information received by the deadline for submitting information. The reviewer may also request clarification of information received and a site visit. After review of the additional information, the Superintendent may:

    1. Sustain the notice of violation;
    2. Withdraw the notice of violation;
    3. Continue the review to a date certain, not to exceed 90 days, for receipt of additional information; or
    4. Modify the notice of violation, including extending the compliance date, not to exceed 90 days.
3. The Superintendent shall issue an Order of the Superintendent containing the decision and shall mail the Order by first-class mail to the person or persons named on the notice of violation. The Superintendent may record the Order with the King County Recorder's Office.

### 18.30.050 - Civil Penalty, Abatement, and Additional Relief.

1. If a responsible party does not abate an unauthorized use or dumping and restore the park property or apply for and obtain a permit to authorize the use by the date set for compliance by the Superintendent in a notice of violation, order of the Superintendent, or Stop Work Order, the Superintendent may:

    1. Impose a civil penalty of $500 for each day the unauthorized use continues beyond the compliance date, plus the pro-rata fee for a Revocable Use Permit for the use, as set forth in the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation Fee Schedule established by Section 18.28.010, starting the date the violation began and continuing until a Revocable Use Permit is issued or the unpermitted use is abated;
    2. Impose a civil penalty of $500 for each day dumping occurs or remains unabated, starting the date the violation began or occurred and continuing until the date the dumping is abated.
    3. Abate the unauthorized use or dumping and restore the affected park property, at the responsible party's expense;
    4. Refer the matter to the City Attorney, who may bring an action for civil penalties, equitable relief, or any other appropriate civil or criminal remedy, including the recovery of its enforcement costs. Enforcement costs include, but are not limited to: administrative expenses and fees; the cost of any land surveys related to enforcement; the costs of any abatement and restoration of park property after abatement; recording fees; and litigation costs and statutory attorneys' fees; or
    5. Use any combination of the above remedies.
2. A subaccount shall be established in the Parks Fund to receive revenue from penalties under this Section 18.30.050, which shall be allocated to fund the enforcement of this Chapter 18.30.

### 18.30.055 - Department abatement of unauthorized uses—Unidentified responsible parties and emergency situations

If the Department cannot identify a party responsible for the unauthorized use despite using all reasonable means, or if the Department determines that the unauthorized use creates substantial risk of injury to persons, to park property, to utilities serving the park property and/or to park improvements, the Superintendent may, without notice, abate the unauthorized use and restore the affected park property. If the responsible party is identified after abatement occurs the violation will be deemed to begin on the date the Department became aware of the violation and the Superintendent may pursue the remedies provided by Section 18.30.050.


### 18.30.100 - Severability.

All sections and subsections of this chapter are severable, and if any section or subsection is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the validity and effectiveness of any other section or subsection.
