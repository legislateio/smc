The Director of Transportation may waive compliance with the terms and conditions of this section with permit applications by the United States of America and its agencies, by the state and by municipal corporations, and in the case of an application for moorage of a vessel listed upon the national historic register maintained by the United States, with the bond requirements in subsection G of this section.

Subject to subsection D4 below, the fee schedule may provide a special classification for nonprofit organizations that, under a contract with the City, participate actively in City water-safety and boating programs for youth in which the rate or the calculation of the area used takes into account the activities of the organization at the site for the youth program.
    4. The exception and allowance in subsections D2 and D3 apply whenever the Director of Transportation and the Port Warden determine that upon application and issuance of a permit no substantial administration or policing would be involved and the usage would not interfere with commerce or navigation nor be unduly prolonged.

The fee schedule, when approved by the City Council by ordinance, shall govern the amount of the fee for any such permit, which fee shall be collected as a condition to the issuance or continuance of any such permit other than permits issued to the United States and its agencies, the state, or any municipal corporation.
