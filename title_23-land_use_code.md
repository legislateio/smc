Introduction: User Information

The Land Use Code contains provisions typically associated with determining what use may be made of a person's property. It is organized in subtitles which describe the general provisions of Title 23 (Subtitle I), incorporate City approvals necessary for the division of land (Subtitle II), detail the establishment of zones and the use regulations and development standards applicable within zones (Subtitle III) and coordinate the administrative and enforcement procedures necessary to implement the land use regulations (Subtitle IV).

While the provisions of Title 23 are integrated and extensive, they do not include all requirements conceivably related to development. For example, with the exception of the coordination of environmental review requirements in the Master Use Permit process, those regulations detailing construction specifications, i.e., building, grading, drainage, etc., are set forth in Title 22, "Building and Construction Codes." Landmark districts and landmark preservation provisions are found in Title 25. The City's SEPA ordinance and environmentally critical areas ordinance are also set forth in Title 25.

## Subtitle I. - General Provisions
### Chapter 23.02 - TITLE AND PURPOSE

Sections:

#### 23.02.010 - Title.

This title shall be known as the Land Use Code of The City of Seattle.


#### 23.02.020 - General purpose and general provisions

1. The purpose of this Land Use Code is to protect and promote public health, safety and general welfare through a set of regulations and procedures for the use of land which are consistent with and implement the City's Comprehensive Plan. Procedures are established to increase citizen awareness of land use activities and their impacts and to coordinate necessary review processes. The Land Use Code classifies land within the City into various land use zones and overlay districts in order to regulate uses and structures. The provisions are designed to provide adequate light, air, access, and open space; conserve the natural environment and historic resources; maintain a compatible scale within an area; minimize traffic congestion and enhance the streetscape and pedestrian environment. They seek to achieve an efficient use of the land without major disruption of the natural environment and to direct development to lots with adequate services and amenities.
2. Other regulations apply, such as but not limited to building and construction codes (SMC Title 22) and provisions for environmental review, critical areas, noise control, tree protection, and historic preservation (SMC Title 25).
3. All structures or uses shall be built or established on a lot or lots.
4. A grant of a waiver, modification, departure, exception or variance from one specific development standard does not relieve the applicant from compliance with any other standard.


### Chapter 23.04 - APPLICABILITY

Sections:

#### 23.04.010 - Transition to the Land Use Code

1. General Rules of Interpretation. Except as otherwise provided, all permits and land use approvals lawfully issued pursuant to repealed provisions of Title 24 or pursuant to a Title 24 zoning classification no longer applicable to the property shall remain in full force and effect for two (2) years from the effective date of repeal or zoning reclassification or until the expiration date of the respective permit or approval if the date is less than two (2) years from the effective date of repeal or zoning reclassification; provided, that permits issued after the effective date of repeal or zoning reclassification shall remain in full force and effect for two (2) years from the date the permit is approved for issuance as described in Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions.
2. Existing Contract Rezones. Contract rezones approved under Title 24 shall remain in effect until the date specified in the rezone property use and development agreement (PUDA). If no expiration date is specified, the rezone shall remain in effect for two years from the effective date of Title 23 zoning for the property or, in the case of downtown, from the effective date of Ordinance 112303 adopting permanent Title 23 zoning for downtown. When Title 23 zoning goes into effect, the property may, at the election of the property owner, be developed pursuant to either the existing rezone property use and development agreement or Title 23. When the contract rezone expires the property shall be regulated solely by the requirements of Title 23. If a property is subject to a PUDA approved under Title 24 and the owner wishes to develop under Title 23, the property may be released from the conditions of the PUDA by the City Council without following the PUDA amendment procedures in 23.76.058.
3. Existing Planned Unit Developments. Planned unit developments (PUDs) in an SF or multifamily zone regulated under Title 23 which were authorized pursuant to Title 24 shall be permitted to develop according to the specific terms of such authorizations. This shall include the opportunity to apply to the Council for an extension of time for completion of PUDs. Upon completion of the PUDs, the provisions of Title 23, including all use and development standards, shall apply.

#### 23.04.040 - Major Institution transition rule.

The following transition rules shall apply only to Major Institution master plans and Major Institution projects:


1. The development program component, as described in subsections D and E of Section 23.69.030, of a master plan which was adopted before the effective date of the 1996 Major Institutions Ordinance, or for which an application was filed before the effective date of the 1996 Major Institutions Ordinance and which was subsequently adopted, shall remain effective through its adopted expiration date. If no expiration date was adopted for a development program that was adopted before the effective date of the 1996 Major Institutions Ordinance, it shall expire on May 2, 2000. Amendments to a development program component shall be subject to the provisions of Section 23.69.035. The institution may choose to update the entire development program component, as described in subsections D and E of Section 23.69.030, by applying for an amendment pursuant to Section 23.69.035. The Director may require new or changed development standards as part of this process, and any prior expiration date would be eliminated.
2. The development standards component, as described in subsections B and C of Section 23.69.030, of a master plan which was adopted before the effective date of the 1996 Major Institutions Ordinance, or for which an application was filed before the effective date of the 1996 Major Institutions Ordinance and which was subsequently adopted, shall remain in effect unless amended. Amendments to a development standard component shall be subject to the provisions of Section 23.69.035.
3. A transportation management program, as described in subsection F of Section 23.69.030, which was approved before the effective date of the 1996 Major Institutions Ordinance shall remain in effect unless amended. Amendment of such a transportation management program shall be subject to the provisions of Section 23.69.035.
4. Master Plan Proceeding Under Code in Effect at Time of Filing. When an application and applicable fees have been filed for a master plan prior to the effective date of the 1996 Major Institutions Ordinance, the master plan shall be subject either to the procedures and provisions in effect at the time of filing or to the newly adopted procedures and provisions, at the discretion of the applicant, provided that:

    1. The applicant may elect only one (1) set of procedures and provisions which shall apply throughout the process; and
    2. The election of applicable procedures and provisions shall be made within sixty (60) days following the effective date of the 1996 Major Institutions Ordinance; and
    3. The election shall be irrevocable and shall be made in writing on a form provided by the Director; and
    4. If no election is made, the master plan shall be subject to the procedures and provisions in effect at the time of filing.

##### 23.22.024 - Distribution of preliminary plans

If the Director determines that the subdivider has met all the application requirements for the preliminary plat and that the preliminary plat contains sufficient elements and data to furnish a basis for its approval or disapproval, the Director shall affix a file number and date of receipt to the application and promptly forward three copies of the plat and the subdivider's preliminary plans for streets and other improvements to the Director of Transportation.

##### 23.22.028 - Effect of preliminary plat approval

1. Except as provided in Section 22.800.100, approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute authorization for the subdivider to develop the subdivision facilities and improvements as required in the approved preliminary plat. Development shall be in strict accordance with the plans and specifications as prepared or approved by the Director of Transportation and subject to any conditions imposed by the Hearing Examiner.
2. If the Hearing Examiner approves of the applicant proceeding with more than one final plat pursuant to subsection 23.22.054.B, then approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute approval for the use of multiple final plats.
3. Except as provided in Section 22.800.100, no subdivision requirements that become effective after the approval of a preliminary plat for a subdivision shall apply to such subdivision unless the Hearing Examiner determines that a change in conditions created a serious threat to the public health or safety.


#### Subchapter II - Preliminary Plat Considerations
##### 23.22.050 - Topographical and surface hazards—Protective improvements.

Land having topographical or subsurface conditions hazardous to the health, safety or general welfare of persons or property in or near a proposed subdivision shall not be subdivided unless the construction of protective improvements will eliminate the hazards or unless land subject to the hazard is restricted to uses which will not expose persons or property to the hazard. Protective improvements consistent with the standards established in Subchapter VI shall be constructed, prior to final plat approval unless a performance bond acceptable to the Director of Engineering is filed in lieu of the improvements.


##### 23.22.052 - Dedications required.

1. Every subdivision shall include adequate provision for dedication of drainage ways, streets, alleys, pedestrian access and circulation, easements, slope rights, parks and other public open spaces for general purposes as may be required to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
2. Protective improvements and easements to maintain the improvements shall be dedicated at the discretion of the City.
3. Sidewalks shall be provided on dedicated streets, and must be convenient for pedestrians and contiguous to each other and to any private sidewalks within the subdivision and to existing sidewalks contiguous to the subdivision.
4. Vehicular access to every lot shall be from a dedicated street, unless the Director determines that the following conditions exist, and permits access by a permanent private easement:

    1. Access by private easement would not compromise the goals of the Land Use Code to provide for adequate pedestrian access and safety, light, air and usable open space between structures; and
    2. The dedication and improvement of a street is not necessary or desirable to facilitate adequate water supply for domestic water purposes or for fire protection, or to facilitate adequate storm drainage; and
    3. The dedication and improvement of a street is not necessary or desirable in order to provide on-street parking; and
    4. No potential safety hazards would result from multiple access points between existing and future developments onto a roadway without curbs and with limited sight lines; and
    5. There is identifiable access for the public and for emergency vehicles; and
    6. There is no potential for extending the street system.
5. Roads not dedicated to the public must be clearly marked on the face of the plat. Subdivisions adjacent to navigable bodies of water shall contain dedications for public access to the bodies of water unless the Hearing Examiner determines that the public interest will not be served by the dedication. The dedication shall be to the low water mark and shall include easements for pedestrian access and circulation at least ten (10) feet wide parallel to and bordering the high water mark.
6. If the Hearing Examiner concludes that the public interest will be served, the Hearing Examiner may, in lieu of requiring the dedication to the public of land in a subdivision for protective improvements, drainage ways, streets, alleys, pedestrian access and circulation, parks and other open space, allow the land to be conveyed to a homeowner's nonprofit maintenance corporation. In that case the subdivider shall, at or prior to the time of filing a final plat for approval, supply the Director with copies of articles of incorporation and bylaws of the grantee organization and with evidence of the conveyance or of a binding commitment to convey. The articles of incorporation shall provide that membership in the corporation shall be conditioned upon ownership of land in the subdivision, that the corporation is empowered to assess the land for costs of construction and maintenance of the improvements and property owned by the corporation, and that the assessment shall be a lien upon the land. The City Attorney shall review and approve the articles of incorporation and bylaws as to compliance with this provision. The Hearing Examiner may impose other conditions as he or she deems appropriate to assure that property and improvements owned by the corporation will be adequately constructed and maintained.
7. Any dedication, donation or grant as shown on the face of the plat shall be considered, to all intents and purposes, as a quitclaim deed to the donee or donees, grantee or grantees, for his, her or their use for the purpose intended by the donors or grantors.
8. Dedicated sidewalks, streets and alleys shall meet the requirements of Chapter 23.53 and the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual. Private easements shall meet the requirements of Section 23.53.025.

##### 23.22.054 - Public use and interest

1. The Hearing Examiner shall inquire into the public use and interest proposed to be served by the establishment of the subdivision and dedication. The Hearing Examiner shall consider all relevant facts to determine whether the public interest will be served by the subdivision and dedication, and if it finds that the proposed plat makes appropriate provision for the public health, safety and general welfare and for open spaces, drainage ways, streets, alleys, other public ways, transit stops, potable water supplies, sanitary wastes, fire protection facilities, parks, playgrounds, sites for school and schoolgrounds, sidewalks and other planning features that assure safe walking conditions for students who walk to and from school, is designed to maximize the retention of existing trees, and that the public use and interest will be served by the platting of subdivision, then it shall be approved. If the Hearing Examiner finds that the proposed plat does not provide the appropriate elements or that the public use and interest will not be served, then the Hearing Examiner may disapprove the proposed plat. Dedication of land to any public body may be required as a condition of subdivision approval and shall be clearly shown on the final plat. The Hearing Examiner shall not as a condition to the approval of any plat require a release from damages to be procured from other property owners.
2. If an applicant proposes to proceed with more than one final plat pursuant to subsection 23.22.020.D, the Hearing Examiner shall inquire into the feasibility of the proposed use of multiple final plats and shall approve or disapprove the use of multiple final plats as part of the preliminary plat decision. The Hearing Examiner shall approve the use of multiple final plats only if, in the event that fewer than all of the multiple final plats are completed, the public use and interest will still be served. If the Hearing Examiner approves use of multiple final plats, then the Hearing Examiner shall impose any conditions on the preliminary plat approval that may be necessary to serve the public use and interest in connection with the use of multiple final plats, including but not limited to conditions ensuring that street connectivity is maintained and that appropriate provision has been made for the facilities and improvements described in subsection 23.22.054.A to be provided in a timely manner to serve the property in each final plat. If the Hearing Examiner approves use of multiple final plats, then the Hearing Examiner shall designate in the preliminary plat approval the time period for completion of the facilities and improvements required for each final plat.

##### 23.22.056 - Flood control zone.

No plat shall be approved by the Hearing Examiner covering any land situated in a flood control zone as provided in RCW Chapter 86.16 without the prior written approval of the State Department of Ecology.


##### 23.22.058 - Environmentally critical areas.

No plat shall be approved by the Hearing Examiner covering any land situated in a riparian corridor, wetland and wetland buffer, or steep slope and steep slope buffer unless in compliance with the applicable provisions of Section 25.09.240, Short subdivisions and subdivisions, in environmentally critical areas.


##### 23.22.060 - Transportation concurrency level-of-service standards.

Proposed subdivisions shall meet the transportation concurrency level-of-service standards prescribed in Chapter 23.52.


##### 23.22.062 - Unit lot subdivisions

1. The provisions of this Section 23.22.062 apply exclusively to the unit subdivision of land for single-family dwelling units, townhouse, rowhouse, and cottage housing developments, and existing apartment structures built prior to January 1, 2013, but not individual apartment units, in all zones in which these uses are permitted, or any combination of the above types of residential development as permitted in the applicable zones.
2. Except for any site for which a permit has been issued pursuant to Sections 23.44.041 or 23.45.545 for a detached accessory dwelling unit, lots developed or proposed to be developed with uses described in subsection 23.22.062.A above may be subdivided into individual unit lots. The development as a whole shall meet development standards applicable at the time the permit application is vested. As a result of the subdivision, development on individual unit lots may be nonconforming as to some or all of the development standards based on analysis of the individual unit lot, except that any private usable open space or private amenity area for each dwelling unit shall be provided on the same unit lot as the dwelling unit it serves.
3. Subsequent platting actions, additions or modifications to the structure(s) may not create or increase any nonconformity of the parent lot.
4. Access easements and joint use and maintenance agreements shall be executed for use of common garage or parking areas, common open space (such as common courtyard open spaces for cottage housing), and other similar features, as recorded with the King County Recorder.
5. Within the parent lot, required parking for a dwelling unit may be provided on a different unit lot than the lot with the dwelling unit, as long as the right to use that parking is formalized by an easement on the plat, as recorded with the King County Recorder.
6. The fact that the unit lot is not a separate buildable lot and that additional development of the individual unit lots may be limited as a result of the application of development standards to the parent lot shall be noted on the plat, as recorded with the King County Recorder.

#### Subchapter IV - Reserved Land
##### 23.22.082 - Land reserved for public use.

Any public agency with the power to acquire land by condemnation or otherwise for public use may, at any time prior to final approval of a preliminary plat, notify the council and the subdivider of its intention to acquire some or all of the land in the proposed subdivision for public use, and may request that the Council require its dedication for the use. In the event the land is not dedicated for the use, the public agency may request that the Council require the reservation of the land for a stated period not to exceed the two (2) years following the Council's approval of the final plat, during which time the agency may acquire the land. If the Council finds that the public health, safety, or general welfare will be served, it may require as a condition precedent to approval of the final plat that the land or that part of it as the Council deems appropriate be designated on the plat as reserved land and that for the period requested or a shorter period as the Council deems sufficient, the reserved land not be developed for uses other than the contemplated public use. A public agency may accelerate the expiration date of a reservation period by filing written notice with the King County Director of Records and Elections of its intention to abandon its right to acquire the reserved land.


##### 23.22.084 - Reserved land to show on plat.

The subdivider may indicate on the plat that if the reserved land is not acquired for public use, it shall be subdivided and if the subdivider does so the plat shall show the configuration and dimensions of the proposed lots, blocks, streets, easements and like features in the reserved area.


##### 23.22.086 - No development on reserved land.

No building permit or other development permit shall be issued for improvements on reserved land during the period of reservation unless the public agency has abandoned its rights and except as expressly authorized by the Council at the time the final plat is approved.


##### 23.22.088 - Development if not acquired.

If the public agency has not acquired or commenced proceedings to acquire the reserved lands within the period set by the Council, the subdivider may proceed to develop land lying within the reserved area in conformity with the final plat. No improvements shall be made upon reserved land which is made available for development until adequate security for development of all required public and protective improvements has been provided.



#### Subchapter V - Survey Requirements
##### 23.22.092 - Registered land surveyor.

A survey of every proposed subdivision and the preparation of preliminary and final plats of the subdivision shall be made by or under the supervision of a registered land surveyor who shall certify on the plat that it is a true and correct representation of the lands actually surveyed.

In the event a final plat is approved before streets are graded, the security deposit to provide for grading shall be sufficient to pay the costs of setting the monuments estimated by the Director of Transportation.
4. Each lot corner shall be marked by a three-quarter (¾) inch galvanized iron pipe, twenty-four (24) inches in length, or approved equivalent, driven into the ground.

##### 23.22.098 - Property contiguous to water.

If any land in a subdivision is contiguous to a body of water, a meander line shall be established along the shore at a safe distance back from the ordinary high water mark. Property lying below and beyond the meander line shall be defined by distance along the side property lines extended from the meander line. If the thread of a stream lies within a subdivision or forms the boundary of a subdivision, such thread shall be defined by bearings and distances as it exists at the time of the survey.

    8. Conformance to the provisions of Section 23.24.046, Multiple single-family dwelling units on a single-family lot, when the short subdivision is for the purpose of creating two or more lots from one lot with more than one existing single-family dwelling unit.
    9. Every lot except unit lots and lots proposed to be platted for individual live-work units in zones where live-work units are permitted, shall conform to the following standards for lot configuration, unless a special exception is authorized under subsection 23.24.040.B:

        1. If a lot is proposed with street frontage, then one lot line shall abut the street for at least 10 feet; and
        2. No lot shall be less than 10 feet wide for a distance of more than 10 feet as measured at any point; and
        3. No proposed lot shall have more than six separate lot lines. The lot lines shall be straight lines, unless the irregularly shaped lot line is caused by an existing right-of-way or an existing lot line; and
        4. If the property proposed for subdivision is adjacent to an alley, and the adjacent alley is either improved or required to be improved according to the standards of Section 23.53.030, then no new lot shall be proposed that does not provide alley access, except that access from a street to an existing use or structure is not required to be changed to alley access. Proposed new lots shall either have sufficient frontage on the alley to meet access standards for the zone in which the property is located or provide an access easement from the proposed new lot or lots to the alley that meets access standards for the zone in which the property is located.
2. Special Exception. The Director may modify the standards of subsection 23.24.040.A.9, as a Type II special exception decision, if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed plat meets the following criteria:

    1. The property has one of the following conditions not created by the applicant:

        1. Natural topographic features or natural obstructions prevent the platting of one or more lots according to the standards of subsection 23.24.040.A.9;
        2. Location of existing principal structures that are retained on lots existing prior to the proposed platting require a platting configuration of one or more lots that cannot reasonably meet the standards of subsection 23.24.040.A.9;
        3. Location of existing easements or feasibility of access to portions of the property prevents the configuration of proposed plat lines that meet the standards of subsection 23.24.040.A.9.
    2. Modification of the standards of subsection 23.24.040.A.9 shall be the minimum necessary to allow platting of lots that each contain a building area for development meeting the development standards of the zone in which the proposed plat is located.
    3. Lots created under the special exception standards of this subsection 23.24.040.B shall not have a configuration that requires a variance from setbacks and yard requirements of the Land Use Code or a variance or exception from the Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas for any development that may be proposed on the lots.
3. If the short subdivision contains a proposed dedication, the Director shall refer the matter to the Director of Transportation for a report and recommendation prior to the approval of the short subdivision. The short plat or dedication instrument reflecting the proposed dedication shall be transmitted to the City Council for acceptance of the dedication by ordinance.

#### 23.24.045 - Unit lot subdivisions

1. The provisions of this Section 23.24.045 apply exclusively to the unit subdivision of land for single-family dwelling units, townhouse, rowhouse, and cottage housing developments, and existing apartment structures built prior to January 1, 2013, but not individual apartment units, in all zones in which these uses are permitted, or any combination of the above types of residential development as permitted in the applicable zones.
2. Except for any lot for which a permit has been issued pursuant to Sections 23.44.041 or 23.45.545 for a detached accessory dwelling unit, lots developed or proposed to be developed with uses described in subsection 23.24.045.A above may be subdivided into individual unit lots. The development as a whole shall meet development standards applicable at the time the permit application is vested. As a result of the subdivision, development on individual unit lots may be nonconforming as to some or all of the development standards based on analysis of the individual unit lot, except that any private, usable open space or private amenity area for each dwelling unit shall be provided on the same unit lot as the dwelling unit it serves.
3. Subsequent platting actions, additions or modifications to the structure(s) may not create or increase any nonconformity of the parent lot.
4. Access easements and joint use and maintenance agreements shall be executed for use of common garage or parking areas, common open space (such as common courtyard open space for cottage housing), and other similar features, as recorded with the Director of the King County Department of Records and Elections.
5. Within the parent lot, required parking for a dwelling unit may be provided on a different unit lot than the lot with the dwelling unit, as long as the right to use that parking is formalized by an easement on the plat, as recorded with the Director of the King County Department of Records and Elections.
6. The facts that the unit lot is not a separate buildable lot, and that additional development of the individual unit lots may be limited as a result of the application of development standards to the parent lot shall be noted on the plat, as recorded with the Director of the King County Department of Records and Elections.

#### 23.24.050 - Director's decision

1. If the Director determines that the provisions of this Chapter 23.24 are satisfied, or may be satisfied upon compliance with specified conditions, the Director shall inform the applicant in writing of the decision to approve the application and the conditions of the approval, if any, and may return the proposed short plat to the applicant for modification or correction. When the Director has determined that: (1) the short plat contains the certificates, dedication instruments and statements of approval required by state law and this Chapter 23.24; (2) the short plat and all legal descriptions are technically correct; and (3) review procedures pursuant to Chapter 23.76 have been concluded, the short plat shall be filed for record with the King County Director of Records and Elections. Except for purposes of appeal, no short plat or short subdivision granted approval by the Director shall be deemed to have final approval until filed.
2. The decision of the Director on a short subdivision is subject to the further review procedures established under the Master Use Permit process, Chapter 23.76.
3. Except as provided in Section 22.800.100, a short plat shall be governed by the terms of approval of the Director's decision, and any lots created thereunder shall be deemed to meet lot requirements imposed by this Land Use Code for a period of no less than five years unless the City Council finds that a change in circumstances has occurred.

#### 23.24.060 - Redivision procedures.

Within a five (5) year period following the filing of a short subdivision in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 23.22, property within that short subdivision may not be further divided through the short subdivision process if it would result in more than a total of nine (9) lots. However, any revision of the lot lines of an approved short subdivision in which the total number of lots is not increased shall not be considered a further division, and shall be approved or disapproved in the manner prescribed in Chapter 23.28.



### Chapter 23.28 - LOT BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENTS

Sections:

#### 23.28.010 - Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a method for summary approval of lot boundary adjustments which do not create any additional lot, tract, parcel, site or division, while insuring that such lot boundary adjustment satisfies public concerns of health, safety, and welfare.


#### 23.28.020 - Application for approval of lot boundary adjustment.

Anyone seeking an approval by the Director of a lot boundary adjustment shall file an application as provided in Chapter 23.76, the Master Use Permit Process. All applications for lot boundary adjustments shall contain the following:


1. A plan showing the proposed change and containing standard survey data;
2. A plot plan as appropriate showing the location and dimensions of existing structures in relation to the proposed lot boundary adjustment;

    1. No additional lot, tract, parcel, site, or division is created by the proposed adjustment;
    2. No lot contains insufficient area and dimensions to meet the minimum requirements for development as calculated under the development standards of the zone in which the lots affected are situated, except as provided in Section 23.44.010, and under any applicable regulations for siting development on parcels with riparian corridors, wetlands, wetland buffers, or steep slopes in Chapter 25.09 or on parcels containing priority freshwater habitat or priority saltwater habitat in Section 23.60A.160. Adjusted lots shall continue to be regarded as existing lots for purposes of Chapter 25.09. Any required nondisturbance area shall be legibly shown and described on the site plan, and a covenant shall be required as set out in Section 25.09.335;
    3. Every proposed adjusted lot shall conform to the following standards for lot configuration, unless a modification is authorized under subsection 23.28.030.A.4:

        1. If an adjusted lot is proposed with street frontage, then one lot line shall abut the street for at least 10 feet; and
        2. No adjusted lot shall be less than 10 feet wide for a distance of more than 10 feet as measured at any point; and
        3. No adjusted lot shall have more than six separate lot lines. The lot lines shall be straight lines unless the irregularly shaped lot line is caused by an existing right-of-way or existing lot line; and
        4. If a lot to be adjusted abuts upon an alley, and that alley is either improved or required to be improved according to the standards of Section 23.53.030, then no adjusted lot shall be proposed that does not provide alley access, except that access from a street to an existing use or structure is not required to be changed to alley access. Either the proposed adjusted lots shall have sufficient frontage on the alley to meet access standards for the zone in which the property is located or an access easement from the adjusted lot or lots shall be provided to the alley that meets access standards for the zone in which the property is located.
    4. Modification. The Director's recommendation on a proposed lot adjustment may modify the standards of subsection 23.28.030.A.3 if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed lot boundary adjustment meets the following criteria:

        1. The property has one of the following conditions not created by the applicant:

            1. Natural topographic features or natural obstructions prevent the reconfiguration of one or more lots according to the standards of subsection 23.28.030.A.3;
            2. Location of existing principal structures that are retained on lots existing prior to the proposed lot boundary adjustment require a reconfiguration of one or more lots that cannot reasonably meet the standards of subsection 23.28.030.A.3;
            3. Location of existing easements or feasibility of access to portions of the property prevents the reconfiguration of lot lines that meet the standards of subsection 23.28.030.A.3.
        2. Modification of the standards of subsection 23.28.030.A.3 shall be the minimum necessary to allow adjusted lots that each contain a building area for development that meets the development standards of the zone in which the proposed lot boundary adjustment is located.
    5. The adjusted lot has adequate drainage, water supply and sanitary sewage disposal, and access for vehicles, utilities and fire protection;
    6. The lot boundary adjustment is consistent with applicable provisions of Title 23 of the Seattle Municipal Code.
2. An application for a lot boundary adjustment on a parcel containing an environmentally critical area or buffer shall include the information described in Section 25.09.330, unless the Director determines that some of the information listed is not necessary for reviewing the application.



## Subtitle III - Land Use Regulations
### Division 1 - Land Use Zones

### Chapter 23.30 - ZONE DESIGNATIONS ESTABLISHED

Sections:

#### 23.30.010 - Classifications for the purpose of this Subtitle III

1. General zoning designations. The zoning classification of land shall include one of the designations in this subsection 23.30.010.A. Only in the case of land designated "RC" the classification shall include both "RC" and one additional multifamily zone designation in this subsection 23.30.010.A.
2. Suffixes—Height Limits, Letters and Incentive Provisions. The zoning classification for land subject to some of the designations in subsection 23.30.010.A include one or more numerical suffixes indicating height limit(s) or a range of height limits, or one or more letter suffixes indicating certain overlay districts or designations, or numerical suffixes enclosed in parentheses indicating the application of incentive zoning provisions, or any combination of these. A letter suffix may be included only in accordance with provisions of this title expressly providing for the addition of the suffix. A zoning classification that includes a numerical or letter suffix or other combinations denotes a different zone than a zoning classification without any suffix or with additional, fewer or different suffixes. Except where otherwise specifically stated in this title or where the context otherwise clearly requires, each reference in this title to any zoning designation in subsection 23.30.010.A without a suffix, or with fewer than the maximum possible number of suffixes, includes any zoning classifications created by the addition to that designation of one or more suffixes.

#### 23.30.020 - Zone boundaries.

Unless the location of zone boundary lines is expressly established by reference to established lines, points or features on the Official Land Use Map, the zone boundary lines are the centerlines of streets, including freeways, expressways and parkways, public alleys, waterways or railroad rights-of-way, or in the case of navigable water, the pierhead or outer harbor lines, or in the case of Lake Union, the "Seattle Construction Limit Line" as established by Section 23.60.014. Where the pierhead, outer harbor lines or construction limit lines are not established, then the zone boundary lines shall be on the water side of the natural shoreline and five hundred feet (500'), measured at right angles, from the shoreline. If the exact location of a zone boundary line cannot be determined otherwise, then its location shall be determined by measuring to scale on the Official Land Use Map.


#### 23.30.030 - Property not specifically zoned.

In every case where property has not been specifically included within a zone on the Official Land Use Map the property is declared to be in the SF 9600 Zone. This provision shall apply to any property included in areas annexed to the City after the effective date of this provision unless the area is zoned at the time of annexation.



### Chapter 23.32 - LAND USE MAPS

Sections:

#### 23.32.006 - Underlying zones established.

The zone classifications established in Section 23.30.010 and their boundaries within the City are established as shown on the series of maps, marked Exhibit "A" to the ordinance from which this section derives.


#### 23.32.010 - Overlay districts established.

The overlay districts regulated in Part 3 of this subtitle are also established on the maps identified as Exhibit "A" to the ordinance from which this section derives.


#### 23.32.016 - Official Land Use Map.

The Official Land Use Map of The City of Seattle, Exhibit A of Ordinance 110381, is by this reference made a part of this subtitle and may hereafter be amended.



### Chapter 23.34 - AMENDMENTS TO OFFICIAL LAND USE MAP (REZONES)

Sections:

#### Subchapter I - Procedure
##### 23.34.002 - Standard rezone procedures.

Procedures for amending the Official Land Use Map, including overlay districts and shoreline environment classifications, shall be as provided in Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions.


##### 23.34.004 - Contract rezones

1. Property Use and Development Agreement. The Council may approve a map amendment subject to the execution, delivery, and recording of a property use and development agreement (PUDA) executed by the legal or beneficial owner of the property to be rezoned containing self-imposed restrictions upon the use and development of the property in order to ameliorate adverse impacts that could occur from unrestricted use and development permitted by development regulations otherwise applicable after the rezone. All restrictions imposed by the PUDA shall be directly related to the impacts that may be expected to result from the rezone. A contract rezone shall be conditioned on performance or compliance with the terms and conditions of the PUDA. Council may revoke a contract rezone or take other appropriate action allowed by law for failure to comply with a PUDA. The PUDA shall be approved as to form by the City Attorney, and shall not be construed as a relinquishment by the City of its discretionary powers.
2. Waiver of Certain Requirements. The ordinance accepting the PUDA may waive specific bulk or off-street parking and loading requirements if the Council determines that the waivers are necessary under the agreement to achieve a better development than would otherwise result from the application of regulations of the zone. No waiver of requirements shall be granted that would be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the zone or vicinity in which the property is located.


#### Subchapter II - Rezone Criteria
##### 23.34.007 - Rezone evaluation

1. The provisions of this chapter apply to all rezones except correction of mapping errors. In evaluating proposed rezones, the provisions of this chapter shall be weighed and balanced together to determine which zone or height designation best meets those provisions. In addition, the zone function statements, which describe the intended function of each zone designation, shall be used to assess the likelihood that the area proposed to be rezoned would function as intended.
2. No single criterion or group of criteria shall be applied as an absolute requirement or test of the appropriateness of a zone designation, nor is there a hierarchy or priority of rezone considerations, unless a provision indicates the intent to constitute a requirement or sole criterion.
3. Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter 23.34 shall constitute consistency with the Comprehensive Plan for the purpose of reviewing proposed rezones, except that Comprehensive Plan Shoreline Environment Policies shall be used in shoreline environment redesignations as provided in subsection 23.60A.042.C.
4. Provisions of this chapter that pertain to areas inside of urban centers or villages shall be effective only when a boundary for the subject center or village has been established in the Comprehensive Plan. Provisions of this chapter that pertain to areas outside of urban villages or outside of urban centers shall apply to all areas that are not within an adopted urban village or urban center boundary.
5. The procedures and criteria for shoreline environment redesignations are located in Sections 23.60A.042, 23.60A.060 and 23.60A.220.
6. Mapping errors due to cartographic or clerical mistakes may be corrected through process required for Type V Council land use decisions in SMC Chapter 23.76 and do not require the evaluation contemplated by the provisions of this chapter.

##### 23.34.008 - General rezone criteria.

1. To be approved a rezone shall meet the following standards:

    1. In urban centers and urban villages the zoned capacity for the center or village taken as a whole shall be no less than one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the growth targets adopted in the Comprehensive Plan for that center or village.
    2. For the area within the urban village boundary of hub urban villages and for residential urban villages taken as a whole the zoned capacity shall not be less than the densities established in the Urban Village Element of the Comprehensive Plan.
2. Match Between Zone Criteria and Area Characteristics. The most appropriate zone designation shall be that for which the provisions for designation of the zone type and the locational criteria for the specific zone match the characteristics of the area to be rezoned better than any other zone designation.
3. Zoning History and Precedential Effect. Previous and potential zoning changes both in and around the area proposed for rezone shall be examined.
4. Neighborhood Plans.

    1. For the purposes of this title, the effect of a neighborhood plan, adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995, shall be as expressly established by the City Council for each such neighborhood plan.
    2. Council adopted neighborhood plans that apply to the area proposed for rezone shall be taken into consideration.
    3. Where a neighborhood plan adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995 establishes policies expressly adopted for the purpose of guiding future rezones, but does not provide for rezones of particular sites or areas, rezones shall be in conformance with the rezone policies of such neighborhood plan.
    4. If it is intended that rezones of particular sites or areas identified in a Council adopted neighborhood plan are to be required, then the rezones shall be approved simultaneously with the approval of the pertinent parts of the neighborhood plan.
5. Zoning Principles. The following zoning principles shall be considered:

    1. The impact of more intensive zones on less intensive zones or industrial and commercial zones on other zones shall be minimized by the use of transitions or buffers, if possible. A gradual transition between zoning categories, including height limits, is preferred.
    2. Physical buffers may provide an effective separation between different uses and intensities of development. The following elements may be considered as buffers:

        1. Natural features such as topographic breaks, lakes, rivers, streams, ravines and shorelines;
        2. Freeways, expressways, other major traffic arterials, and railroad tracks;
        3. Distinct change in street layout and block orientation;
        4. Open space and greenspaces.
    3. Zone Boundaries.

        1. In establishing boundaries the following elements shall be considered:

            1. Physical buffers as described in subsection E2 above;
            2. Platted lot lines.
        2. Boundaries between commercial and residential areas shall generally be established so that commercial uses face each other across the street on which they are located, and face away from adjacent residential areas. An exception may be made when physical buffers can provide a more effective separation between uses.
    4. In general, height limits greater than forty (40) feet should be limited to urban villages. Height limits greater than forty (40) feet may be considered outside of urban villages where higher height limits would be consistent with an adopted neighborhood plan, a major institution's adopted master plan, or where the designation would be consistent with the existing built character of the area.
6. Impact Evaluation. The evaluation of a proposed rezone shall consider the possible negative and positive impacts on the area proposed for rezone and its surroundings.

    1. Factors to be examined include, but are not limited to, the following:

        1. Housing, particularly low-income housing;
        2. Public services;
        3. Environmental factors, such as noise, air and water quality, terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna, glare, odor, shadows, and energy conservation;
        4. Pedestrian safety;
        5. Manufacturing activity;
        6. Employment activity;
        7. Character of areas recognized for architectural or historic value;
        8. Shoreline view, public access and recreation.
    2. Service Capacities. Development which can reasonably be anticipated based on the proposed development potential shall not exceed the service capacities which can reasonably be anticipated in the area, including:

        1. Street access to the area;
        2. Street capacity in the area;
        3. Transit service;
        4. Parking capacity;
        5. Utility and sewer capacity;
        6. Shoreline navigation.
7. Changed Circumstances. Evidence of changed circumstances shall be taken into consideration in reviewing proposed rezones, but is not required to demonstrate the appropriateness of a proposed rezone. Consideration of changed circumstances shall be limited to elements or conditions included in the criteria for the relevant zone and/or overlay designations in this chapter.
8. Overlay Districts. If the area is located in an overlay district, the purpose and boundaries of the overlay district shall be considered.
9. Critical Areas. If the area is located in or adjacent to a critical area (SMC Chapter 25.09), the effect of the rezone on the critical area shall be considered.
10. Incentive Provisions. If the area is located in a zone with an incentive zoning suffix a rezone shall be approved only if one of the following conditions are met:

    1. The rezone includes incentive zoning provisions that would authorize the provision of affordable housing equal to or greater than the amount of affordable housing authorized by the existing zone; or
    2. If the rezone does not include incentive zoning provisions that would authorize the provision of affordable housing equal to or greater than the amount of affordable housing authorized by the existing zone, an adopted City housing policy or comprehensive plan provision identifies the area as not a priority area for affordable housing, or as having an adequate existing supply of affordable housing in the immediate vicinity of the area being rezoned.

##### 23.34.009 - Height limits of the proposed rezone

If a decision to designate height limits in residential, commercial, or industrial zones is independent of the designation of a specific zone, in addition to the general rezone criteria of Section 23.34.008, the following shall apply:


1. Function of the zone. Height limits shall be consistent with the type and scale of development intended for each zone classification. The demand for permitted goods and services and the potential for displacement of preferred uses shall be considered.
2. Topography of the area and its surroundings. Height limits shall reinforce the natural topography of the area and its surroundings, and the likelihood of view blockage shall be considered.
3. Height and scale of the area

    1. The height limits established by current zoning in the area shall be given consideration.
    2. In general, permitted height limits shall be compatible with the predominant height and scale of existing development, particularly where existing development is a good measure of the area's overall development potential.
4. Compatibility with surrounding area

    1. Height limits for an area shall be compatible with actual and zoned heights in surrounding areas excluding buildings developed under Major Institution height limits; height limits permitted by the underlying zone, rather than heights permitted by the Major Institution designation, shall be used for the rezone analysis.
    2. A gradual transition in height and scale and level of activity between zones shall be provided unless major physical buffers, as described in subsection 23.34.008.D.2, are present.
5. Neighborhood plans

    1. Particular attention shall be given to height recommendations in business district plans or neighborhood plans adopted by the City Council subsequent to the adoption of the 1985 Land Use Map.
    2. Neighborhood plans adopted or amended by the City Council after January 1, 1995, may require height limits different than those that would otherwise be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 23.34.009 and Section 23.34.008.

##### 23.34.010 - Designation of single-family zones

1. Except as provided in subsections B or C of Section 23.34.010, single-family zoned areas may be rezoned to zones more intense than Single-family 5000 only if the City Council determines that the area does not meet the criteria for single-family designation.
2. Areas zoned single-family or RSL that meet the criteria for single-family zoning contained in subsection B of Section 23.34.011 and that are located within the adopted boundaries of an urban village may be rezoned to zones more intense than Single-family 5000 if all of the following conditions are met:

    1. A neighborhood plan has designated the area as appropriate for the zone designation, including specification of the RSL/T, RSL/C, or RSL/TC suffix, if applicable;
    2. The rezone is:

        1. To a Residential Small Lot (RSL), Residential Small Lot-Tandem (RSL/T), Residential Small Lot-Cottage (RSL/C), Residential Small Lot-Tandem/Cottage (RSL/TC), Lowrise 1 (LR1), Lowrise 1/Residential-Commercial (LR1/RC), or
        2. Within the areas identified on Map P-1 of the adopted North Beacon Hill Neighborhood Plan, and the rezone is to any Lowrise zone, or to an NC1 zone or NC2 zone with a 30 foot or 40 foot height limit, or
        3. Within the residential urban village west of Martin Luther King Junior Way South in the adopted Rainier Beach Neighborhood Plan, and the rezone is to a Lowrise 1 (LR1) or Lowrise 2 (LR2) zone, or
        4. Within an urban village and the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map designation is a designation other than Single Family.
3. Areas zoned single-family within the Northgate Overlay District, established pursuant to Chapter 23.71, that consist of one or more lots and meet the criteria for single-family zoning contained in subsection B of Section 23.34.011 may be rezoned through a contract rezone to a neighborhood commercial zone if the rezone is limited to blocks (defined for the purpose of this subsection C as areas bounded by street lot lines) in which more than 80 percent of that block is already designated as a neighborhood commercial zone.

##### 23.34.011 - Single-family zones, function and locational criteria.

1. Function. An area that provides predominantly detached single-family structures on lot sizes compatible with the existing pattern of development and the character of single-family neighborhoods.
2. Locational Criteria. A single-family zone designation is most appropriate in areas meeting the following criteria:

    1. Areas that consist of blocks with at least seventy (70) percent of the existing structures, not including detached accessory dwelling units, in single-family residential use; or
    2. Areas that are designated by an adopted neighborhood plan as appropriate for single-family residential use; or
    3. Areas that consist of blocks with less than seventy (70) percent of the existing structures, not including detached accessory dwelling units, in single-family residential use but in which an increasing trend toward single-family residential use can be demonstrated; for example:

        1. The construction of single-family structures, not including detached accessory dwelling units, in the last five (5) years has been increasing proportionately to the total number of constructions for new uses in the area, or
        2. The area shows an increasing number of improvements and rehabilitation efforts to single-family structures, not including detached accessory dwelling units, or
        3. The number of existing single-family structures, not including detached accessory dwelling units, has been very stable or increasing in the last five (5) years, or
        4. The area's location is topographically and environmentally suitable for single-family residential developments.
3. An area that meets at least one (1) of the locational criteria in subsection B above should also satisfy the following size criteria in order to be designated as a single-family zone:

    1. The area proposed for rezone should comprise fifteen (15) contiguous acres or more, or should abut an existing single-family zone.
    2. If the area proposed for rezone contains less than fifteen (15) contiguous acres, and does not abut an existing single-family zone, then it should demonstrate strong or stable single-family residential use trends or potentials such as:

        1. That the construction of single-family structures, not including detached accessory dwelling units, in the last five (5) years has been increasing proportionately to the total number of constructions for new uses in the area, or
        2. That the number of existing single-family structures, not including detached accessory dwelling units, has been very stable or increasing in the last five (5) years, or

    4. Areas where increased commercial densities would allow the economic reuse of small sites and existing buildings no longer suited to current industrial needs;
    5. Areas that, because of their size and isolation from a larger industrial area due to separation by another type of zone or major physical barrier, such as an arterial or waterway, can accommodate more nonindustrial activity without conflicting with the industrial function of the larger industrial area;
    6. Large areas with generally flat topography;
    7. Areas platted into large parcels of land.

##### 23.34.094 - Industrial Buffer (IB) zone, function and locational criteria.

1. Function. An area that provides an appropriate transition between industrial areas and adjacent residential zones, or commercial zones having a residential orientation and/or pedestrian character.
2. Locational Criteria. Industrial Buffer zone designation is most appropriate in areas generally characterized by the following:

    1. Areas containing industrial uses or a mix of industrial activity and a wide range of commercial uses which are located on the edge of a larger industrial area designated Industrial General 1 (IG1), Industrial General 2 (IG2), or Industrial Commercial (IC).
    2. Areas where a transition is needed to protect a less-intensive zone from potential negative impacts of industrial activity when the area directly abuts a residential, Neighborhood Commercial 1 (NC1), Neighborhood Commercial 2 (NC2), Neighborhood Commercial 3 (NC3), Commercial 1 (C1), or Commercial 2 (C2) zone with a substantial amount of residential development and/or pedestrian character.
3. Zone Boundaries. The boundaries and overall depth of the Industrial Buffer (IB) zone shall vary according to the specific conditions of each area, so that an adequate separation between industrial activity and less-intensive zones can be provided to reduce through traffic, noise, visual conflicts, and other impacts of industrial development. However, where there are no special features or other conditions to provide sufficient buffer depth, a distance ranging from three hundred (300) to five hundred (500) feet shall be maintained as a buffer. Within an industrial area, the following conditions help establish the transition desired between industrial areas and less-intensive zones and should be considered in establishing boundaries separating the Industrial Buffer zone from the rest of the industrial area:

    1. Topographic Conditions. Significant changes in topography within an industrial area may provide a good boundary for the Industrial Buffer zone by reducing the noise and visual impacts of the larger industrial area on an abutting, less-intensive zone.
    2. Development Patterns. Changes in the type of activity and/or the scale of existing development occurring along the edge of an industrial area may create conditions that are more compatible with the abutting, less-intensive zone.
    3. Grid and Platting Patterns. Changes in block sizes, shifts in the street grid, a major arterial, undeveloped streets, platted lot lines, and other factors related to the platting pattern often create separate areas which, when located along the edge of an industrial area, can reinforce the transition desired in the Industrial Buffer zone.
    4. Special Features. Certain natural or built features such as railway lines, open spaces, transmission line rights-of-way, and waterways may, because of their width, siting, or landscaping, separate the edge of an industrial zone from a larger industrial area, helping to establish the edge of the Industrial Buffer zone.

##### 23.34.096 - Locational criteria—Industrial Commercial (IC) zone.

The Industrial Commercial (IC) zone is intended to promote development of businesses which incorporate a mix of industrial and commercial activities, including light manufacturing and research and development, while accommodating a wide range of other employment activities. In reviewing a proposal to rezone an area to Industrial Commercial (IC), the following criteria shall be considered:


1. Areas with amenities such as shoreline views, proximity to downtown, or access to public open spaces that could provide an attraction for new businesses, particularly new technology-oriented and research and development activities which might otherwise be likely to seek locations outside the City;
2. Areas in close proximity to major institutions capable of providing support for new technology-oriented and research and development businesses;
3. Former industrial areas which are undergoing a transition to predominantly commercial or mixed commercial and industrial activity, but where transportation and/or other infrastructure capacities are constrained and can only accommodate modest growth without major improvements;
4. Areas where there is an existing concentration of technology-oriented and research and development uses which may be subject to displacement by commercial development;
5. Areas which are underutilized and, through substantial redevelopment, could provide the type of campus-like environment attractive for new technology-oriented industrial and commercial development.

##### 23.34.100 - Designation of Downtown zones.

2. Scale and Character of Development. Areas with the greatest concentration of large buildings of primarily office and commercial use.
3. Transportation and Infrastructure Capacity. Areas with a very high level of access to vehicular and transit systems and where the existing urban infrastructure is adequate or can be easily expanded to support high densities of development.
4. Relationship to Surrounding Activity. A single, contiguous area which is centrally located in relation to other downtown districts having lower intensities of development and more mixing of uses.

##### 23.34.104 - Downtown Office Core-2 (DOC-2) zone, function and locational criteria.

Locations appropriate for Downtown Office Core-2 zone designation shall be consistent with the following:


1. Function. Areas that provide a range of high density office and commercial activities with retail shopping and support services closely related to the primary office core. The density of development is not as great as in the DOC-1 designation.
2. Scale and Character of Development. Areas where large scale office buildings are appropriate and do not adversely affect the pedestrian environment or existing development determined desirable for preservation.
3. Transportation and Infrastructure Capacity. Areas that are well served by transit and vehicular systems and where other urban infrastructure systems are adequate or readily expandable to accommodate anticipated growth.
4. Relationship to Surrounding Activity. Areas shall be adjacent to DOC-1. These areas shall provide transition to the north of the office and retail cores where the character is not well established and land is available for development. To the south of the office core, these areas shall provide a transition to those areas where a strong character exists in Pioneer Square and the International District.
5. Heights. Two (2) height classifications of DOC-2 shall provide transition between the high structures of the DOC-1 designation and areas adjacent to this classification. Generally, maximum heights should be lower in the southern part of downtown to provide transition to Pioneer Square and the International District.

##### 23.34.106 - Downtown Retail Core (DRC) zone, function and locational criteria.

Locations appropriate for Downtown Retail Core zone designation shall be consistent with the following:


1. Function. Areas that provide highly concentrated, regional retail shopping activity in the core of downtown. Retail shopping, entertainment and consumer services predominate at street level, and related and supporting uses occur in the upper floors of buildings. Office and other commercial uses may also be present, but at a density and scale of development that does not conflict with the primary retail function or make the street level environment less conducive to shopping.
2. Scale and Character of Development. Areas with moderate scale buildings and well defined street spaces where sidewalks are lined with a variety of retail shopping, entertainment and consumer services. Areas are characterized by a combination of buildings and street spaces conducive to an active, high quality pedestrian environment on relatively level terrain.
3. Transportation Access. Areas where both vehicular and transit systems provide good access for shoppers. The area is served by a wide range of regional, citywide and local transit routes providing high levels of service during the prime shopping hours of the day and evening. Recognizing that the auto will be a prime means of shopper travel, the area provides good off-peak auto access with adequate amounts of short-term shopper parking.
4. Relationship to Surrounding Activity. The area shall be centrally located in relation to areas of downtown employment and residential concentrations.

##### 23.34.108 - Downtown Mixed Commercial (DMC) zone, function and locational criteria

Locations appropriate for Downtown Mixed Commercial zone designation are consistent with the following:


1. Function. Areas characterized by lower scale office, retail and commercial uses related to activity in the office core, retail core or other moderate-scale commercial cores in the Downtown Urban Center, and with use patterns that may include housing.

1. Function. Areas that provide a mixed use community where housing and associated services and amenities predominate. Office, retail and other commercial uses are compatibly integrated with the predominant residential character at low to moderate densities.
2. Scale and Character of Development. Areas where there is an existing base of housing and the potential exists for establishing a residential community. Areas have the potential for supporting a wide range of residential building types, ranging from midrise structures closely related to the street to larger tower forms. Opportunities exist for major public amenities, such as parks and open space, an enhanced pedestrian network, or views of downtown, Elliott Bay or other surrounding features.
3. Transportation and Infrastructure Capacity. Areas with transportation system and infrastructure system capacity that is sufficient or can be improved to accommodate a substantial residential population. Employment densities are related to the ability of the transportation system to accommodate peak hour traffic flow without adversely affecting the residential environment.
4. Relationship to Surrounding Activity. Areas with surrounding mixed use districts providing transition between primarily residential districts (within or outside downtown) and higher intensity neighborhood core areas within downtown.
5. Mix of Use. Two mix-of-use designations are applied to achieve subarea objectives. The DMR/R designation applies to areas predominantly residential in character or containing large amounts of underused land able to accommodate future residential development; non-residential uses may be present but should be of modest scale, likely to change in the future, or neighborhood serving in character. The DMR/C designation applies to those areas containing housing or having housing potential where larger scale, non-residential serving commercial development exists and is likely to remain.
6. Heights. Downtown Mixed Residential building height designations may be applied to achieve subarea objectives. The lowest height designation generally encompasses the Belltown core, in areas characterized by existing modest scale development, buildings of historic character, or topographic features such as the bluff rising from Elliott Bay. The intermediate building height designation provides transition in height and density to the north and east of the Belltown core and along the bluff where waterfront development divides the area from Elliott Bay. In the Downtown Urban Center east of Interstate 5, the building height designation provides for low to moderate heights. The highest building height designation applies to areas characterized by larger residential and commercial buildings, generally along the eastern edge of Belltown, near the higher density mixed commercial areas of downtown.

##### 23.34.112 - Pioneer Square Mixed (PSM) zone, locational criteria.

The Pioneer Square Mixed zone designation shall apply to those areas which lie within the Pioneer Square Preservation District, north of those areas predominantly in manufacturing and industrial use and not contained within the International Special Review District.

    5. Preferred locations for boundaries shall be streets, alleys or other public rights-of-way. Configuration of platted lot lines, size of parcels, block orientation and street layout shall also be considered.
    6. Selection of boundaries should emphasize physical features that create natural edges such as topographic changes, shorelines, freeways, arterials, changes in street layout and block orientation, and large public facilities, land areas or open spaces, or greenspaces.
    7. New or expanded boundaries shall not be permitted where they would result in the demolition of structures with residential uses or change of use of those structures to non-residential major institution uses unless comparable replacement is proposed to maintain the housing stock of the city.
    8. Expansion of boundaries generally shall not be justified by the need for development of professional office uses.
    9. The establishment or expansion of boundaries shall be in conformance with the provisions of SMC Section 23.69.024, Major Institution designation.
3. Height Criteria. The following criteria shall be used in the selection of appropriate height designations for: 1) proposed new Major Institution Overlay districts; 2) proposed additions to existing MIO districts; and 3) proposed modifications to height limits within existing MIO districts;

    1. Increases to height limits may be considered where it is desirable to limit MIO district boundary by expansion.
    2. Height limits at the district boundary shall be compatible with those in the adjacent areas.
    3. Transitional height limits shall be provided wherever feasible when the maximum permitted height within the overlay district is significantly higher than permitted in areas adjoining the major institution campus.
    4. Height limits should generally not be lower than existing development to avoid creating non-conforming structures.
    5. Obstruction of public scenic or landmark views to, from or across a major institution campus should be avoided where possible.
4. In addition to the general rezone criteria contained in Section 23.34.008, the comments of the Major Institution Master Plan Advisory Committee for the major institution requesting the rezone shall also be considered.

##### 23.34.126 - Designation of the Seattle Mixed (SM) zone.

The Seattle Mixed (SM) zone is applied to achieve the goal of a diverse, mixed-use community with a strong pedestrian orientation. The zone permits a wide range of uses and promotes density to encourage a mixed-use neighborhood. This zoning designation balances the need for flexibility and a variety of activities with the need to provide adequate direction to ensure the presence of housing and commercial activities critical to the success of an urban neighborhood.


##### 23.34.128 - Seattle Mixed (SM) zone, function and locational criteria

In considering rezones to the SM zone designation, the following function and locational criteria shall be taken into consideration:


1. Function. An area within an urban center, urban village, or station area overlay district that provides for a wide range of uses to encourage development of the area into a mixed-use neighborhood with a pedestrian orientation;
2. Transportation and infrastructure capacity. An area that is well-served by transit and vehicular systems and where utility infrastructure is adequate, or where such systems and infrastructure can be readily expanded to accommodate growth;
3. Relationship to surrounding activity. An area that either provides a transition from, or is compatible with, an adjacent neighborhood that is densely developed or zoned for high density mixed use; or an area where a transition to higher density mixed use is desired, either within a larger area characterized primarily by commercial or industrial activity, or within an area where significant investment in public transit infrastructure can accommodate greater density and adequate transition with surrounding areas can be provided;
4. Mix of use. In general, the zone is suitable for a wide range of uses. However, an area within the SM zone may be identified for the purposes of encouraging a primarily residential character. Within these areas, non-residential uses shall generally be of modest scale or neighborhood-serving in character.

    5. The requested variance would be consistent with the spirit and purpose of the Land Use Code regulations for the area.
4. In order to qualify for a variance under the foregoing criteria, an applicant need not demonstrate that, absent the variance, he or she would have no reasonable economic use of the property at issue.
5. When a variance is authorized, conditions may be attached regarding the location, character and other features of a proposed structure or use as may be deemed necessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this Land Use Code.

#### 23.40.030 - Undeveloped streets—Modification of certain development standards.

For purposes of determining yards, setbacks and whether or not a lot is a corner lot or a through lot, the Director may allow an abutting street to be treated as an alley if the Director finds that the lot abuts on at least one (1) other street suitable for vehicular use or is served by an access easement meeting the standards of Section 23.53.025, and that the following criteria are met:


1. The street in the block where it abuts the lot is wholly undeveloped, is unpaved, or is developed with a roadway less than twenty (20) feet in width; and
2. The street provides either no access or only secondary access to those lots to which it abuts; and
3. The development proposed for the lot does not require improvement of the street and no plans to develop the street are on file with the City; and

3. Design review. All Living Building Pilot Program projects are subject to design review and shall be reviewed in accordance with the design review process provided in Section 23.41.014.
4. Height measurement technique. At the discretion of the applicant, the height of a qualifying project shall be determined using either the definition of building height in Section 502 of the Seattle Building Code or the method described in Chapter 23.86 of the Land Use Code.
5. Compliance with minimum standards

    1. Qualifying projects under the Living Building Pilot Program that are granted departures shall meet one of the following:

        1. Living Building Challenge. The intent of the Living Building Pilot Program is to encourage development of buildings that meet or exceed the goals of the Living Building Challenge. A qualifying project shall meet:

            1. all of the imperatives of the Living Building Challenge, version 2.1; or
            2. at least three of the seven performance areas, or "petals," of the Living Building Challenge, version 2.1 (Site, Water, Energy, Health, Materials, Equity, and Beauty), including at least one of the following three petals: Energy, Water, or Materials, and all of the following standards:

                1. total building energy usage shall be 75 percent or less of the energy consumed by a "standard reference design building," as defined in the Seattle Energy Code in effect at the time a complete building permit application is submitted;
                2. total building water usage, not including harvested rainwater, shall be 25 percent or less of the average water usage for a comparable building not in the Living Building Pilot Program, based on Seattle Public Utility estimates or other baseline approved by the Director that would provide a comparable estimate; and
                3. at least 50 percent of stormwater shall be captured and used on site.
        2. RESERVED.
    2.

Compliance must be demonstrated through an independent report from a third party. The report must be produced by the International Living Future Institute (ILFI) or another independent entity approved by the Director.
    3. If the Director determines that the report submitted provides satisfactory evidence that the project has complied with the standards contained in subsection 23.40.060.E.1.a, the Director shall send the owner a written statement that the project has complied with the standards of the Living Building Pilot Program. If the Director determines that the project does not comply with the standards in subsection 23.40.060.E.1.a, the Director shall notify the owner of the aspects in which the project does not comply. Nothing in the written statement or participation in the Living Building Pilot Program shall constitute or imply certification of the project by International Living Future Institute (ILFI) as a Living Building under the Living Building Challenge. Components of the project that are included in order to comply with the minimum standards of the Living Building Pilot Program shall remain for the life of the project.
    4. Within 90 days after the Director notifies the owner of the ways in which the project does not comply, or such longer period as the Director may allow for good cause, the owner may submit a supplemental report demonstrating that it has made alterations or improvements such that the project now meets the standards in subsection 23.40.060.E.1.a.
    5. If the owner fails to submit a supplemental report within the time allowed pursuant to subsection 23.40.060.E.4, the Director shall determine that the project has failed to demonstrate full compliance with the standards contained in subsection 23.40.060.E.1.a, and the owner shall be subject to the penalty in subsection 23.90.018.B.6.


### Chapter 23.41 - DESIGN REVIEW

Sections:

#### Part I - Design Review
##### 23.41.002 - Purpose

The purpose of Design Review is to:


1. Encourage better design and site planning to help ensure that new development enhances the character of the city and sensitively fits into neighborhoods, while allowing for diversity and creativity; and
2. Provide flexibility in the application of development standards to better meet the intent of the Land Use Code as established by City policy, to meet neighborhood objectives, and to provide for effective mitigation of a proposed project's impact and influence on a neighborhood; and
3. Improve communication and mutual understanding among developers, neighborhoods, and the City early and throughout the development review process.

##### 23.41.004 - Applicability


1. Design review is required for all new Major Institution development proposals that exceed any applicable threshold listed in this subsection 23.41.004.A, unless the structure is located within a Major Institution Overlay (MIO) district.
2. Design review is required for all new development proposals located in the Downtown zones listed in Table B for 23.41.004 that exceed any of the following thresholds in Table B for 23.41.004:
3. Design review is required for all new development proposals exceeding 120 feet in width on any single street frontage in the Stadium Transition Area Overlay District as shown in Map A for 23.74.004, and all new development proposals exceeding 12,000 square feet of nonresidential gross floor area and electing to add extra floor area above the base FAR that are located in an IC 85-160 zone.
4. Streamlined administrative design review (SDR) to protect trees. As provided in Sections 25.11.070 and 25.11.080, SDR pursuant to Section 23.41.018 is required for any new development proposals in LR, MR, and commercial zones if an exceptional tree, as defined in Section 25.11.020, is located on the lot and is not proposed to be preserved, if design review would not otherwise be required by this subsection 23.41.004.A.
5. Design review pursuant to Section 23.41.014 is required for projects that are eligible for design review under any provision of this Section 23.41.004 and that are participating in the Living Building Pilot Program authorized by Section 23.40.060.
6. SDR pursuant to Section 23.41.018 is required for all new developments that include at least three townhouse units, if design review is not otherwise required by this subsection 23.41.004.A.
7. Except for development with the boundaries of a Master Planned Community, design review pursuant to Section 23.41.014 is required for a development proposal if the proposal is (a) for three or more attached or detached dwelling units or 2,000 square feet or more of non-residential gross floor area; and (b) on a lot that is abutting one or more qualifying lots and the combined size of development proposals on the subject lot and abutting qualifying lot or lots exceeds thresholds in Table A or Table B to Section 23.41.004. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a "qualifying lot" is a lot for which, on the day a complete application is submitted for a development proposal on the subject lot: (a) a complete Master Use Permit or building permit application for a development proposal that does not exceed thresholds in Table A or B to Section 23.41.004 is or has been submitted; and (b) a certificate of occupancy for the development has not been issued or, for a project where no certificate of occupancy is required, the final inspection pursuant to any issued building permit has not been completed. If complete applications for development proposals are submitted for the subject lot and qualifying lot on the same day, design review is required for both development proposals.

1. Design review required

    1. Design review is required for any new multifamily, commercial, or industrial development proposal that exceeds one of the following thresholds in Table A for 23.41.004:
2. Design review - optional

    1. Full design review is optional to any applicant for new multifamily, commercial or Major Institution development proposals not otherwise subject to this Chapter 23.41, if the new development proposal not otherwise subject to this Chapter 23.41 is in the Stadium Transition Area Overlay District or if the new proposal is in any multifamily, commercial or downtown zone.
    2. Administrative design review is optional for any applicant for new multifamily or commercial development proposals if the new multifamily or commercial development proposal does not exceed the thresholds provided in Table A for 23.41.004 and is not otherwise subject to this Chapter 23.41 if the proposal is in the Stadium Transition Area Overlay District, or is in any multifamily, commercial, or downtown zone, according to the process described in Section 23.41.016. Projects that are not otherwise subject to this Chapter 23.41 and are in any multifamily zone not listed in Table A for 23.41.004 are eligible only for optional full design review under subsection 23.41.004.B.1 if the number of dwelling units exceeds 20. If the project contains 20 dwelling units or less, then the project applicant may pursue either full or administrative design review.
    3. Streamlined administrative design review is an option for:

        1. applicants for multifamily residential uses in LR zones for which design review is not otherwise required by subsection 23.41.004.A; and
        2. applicants for new multifamily and commercial development proposals in Lowrise, Midrise, and Commercial zones to protect a tree over 2 feet in diameter measured 4.5 feet above the ground, if design review would not otherwise be required by subsection 23.41.004.A.5.
3. Exemptions. The following structures are exempt from design review:

Demolishing the character structure would allow for more substantial retention of other, more significant character structures on the lot, such as a structure listed in a rule promulgated by the Director according to Section 23.73.005; or would allow for other key neighborhood development objectives to be achieved, such as improving pedestrian circulation by providing through-block connections, developing arts and cultural facilities, or siting publically-accessible open space at key neighborhood locations.
        2. In addition to the provisions of subsection 23.41.012.B.32.a, the following provisions apply:

            1. At least one character structure shall be retained on the lot if: subsection 23.73.009.C.3 regarding the FAR exemption for residential uses, subsection 23.73.010.B.2 regarding increases in the floor area limits, subsection 23.73.012.B regarding the exception from width and depth measurements, or subsection 23.73.014.B regarding the exception allowing for an additional 10 feet in height are being used by the development proposal.
            2. No character structures are required to be retained on the lot if: subsection 23.73.009.B regarding the exception to allow additional FAR for non-residential uses, subsection 23.73.010.B.1 regarding increases in the floor area limits, or Section 23.73.024 for the use of TDP on a lot that is an eligible TDP receiving site under the provisions of subsection 23.73.024.B are the only provisions being used by the development proposal.
    34. In pedestrian-designated zones, provisions for residential uses at street level, as provided in subsection 23.47A.005.C.1, except that a departure may be granted to allow residential uses at street level to occupy, in the aggregate, no more than 50 percent of the street-level street-facing facade;
    35. In pedestrian-designated zones, provisions for transparency requirements, as provided in subsection 23.47A.008.B, except that departures may be granted to reduce the required transparency from 60 percent to no less than 40 percent of the street-facing facade; and
    36. In pedestrian-designated zones, provisions for height requirements for floor-to-floor height, as provided in subsection 23.47A.008.B, except that departures to allow a mezzanine with less than the minimum floor-to-floor height may be granted provided that the outer edge of the mezzanine floor is at least 15 feet from the exterior wall facing a principal pedestrian street.
3. Limitations upon departures through the design review process established in subsections 23.41.012.B and 23.41.012.D do not limit departures expressly permitted by other provisions of this Title 23 or other titles of the Seattle Municipal Code.

#### 23.42.100 - Nonconformity—Applicability and intent

1. The nonconformity provisions of this Chapter 23.42 apply to uses and sites in all zones, except for the Shoreline District (see Chapter 23.60A).
2. It is the intent of these provisions to establish a framework for dealing with nonconformity that allows most nonconformities to continue. The Code facilitates the maintenance and enhancement of nonconforming uses and developments so they may exist as an asset to their neighborhoods. The redevelopment of nonconformities to be more conforming to current code standards is a long term goal.

#### 23.42.102 - Establishing nonconforming status.

1. Any use that does not conform to current zoning regulations, but conformed to applicable zoning regulations at any time and has not been discontinued as set forth in Section 23.42.104 is recognized as a nonconforming use or development. Any residential development in a residential, commercial or downtown zone that would not be permitted under current Land Use Code regulations, but which existed prior to July 24, 1957, and has not been discontinued as set forth by Section 23.42.104, is recognized as a nonconforming use or development. A recognized nonconforming use shall be established according to the provisions of subsections B through D of this section.
2. Any use or development for which a permit was obtained is considered to be established.
3. A use or development which did not obtain a permit may be established if the Director reviews and approves an application to establish the nonconforming use or development for the record.
4. For a use or development to be established pursuant to subsection C above, the applicant must demonstrate that the use or development would have been permitted under the regulations in effect at the time the use began, or, for a residential use or development, that the use or development existed prior to July 24, 1957 and has remained in continuous existence since that date. Residential development shall be subject to inspection for compliance with minimum standards of the Housing and Building Maintenance Code. (Chapters 22.200 through 22.208). Minimum standards of the Housing and Building Maintenance Code must be met prior to approval of any permit to establish the use and/or development for the record.
5. Nonconforming uses commenced after July 24, 1957 and not discontinued (Section 23.42.104) are also subject to approval through the process of establishing use for the record, if not established by permit. Residential nonconforming uses are subject to inspection under the Housing and Building Maintenance Code if in existence before January 1, 1976. Conformance to the Seattle Building Code in effect at the time a use first began is required if the use first existed after January 1, 1976.

#### 23.42.104 - Nonconforming uses.

1. Any nonconforming use may be continued, subject to the provisions of this section.
2. A nonconforming use that has been discontinued for more than 12 consecutive months shall not be reestablished or recommenced. A use is considered discontinued when:

    1. A permit to permanently change the use of the lot or structure was issued and acted upon; or
    2. The structure or a portion of a structure is not being used for the use allowed by the most recent permit, except that interruption of a nonconforming use by a temporary use authorized pursuant to Section 23.42.040, if no structures are demolished, is not a discontinuation of the previous nonconforming use; or
    3. The structure is vacant, or the portion of the structure formerly occupied by the nonconforming use is vacant. The use of the structure is considered discontinued even if materials from the former use remain or are stored on the property. A multifamily structure with one or more vacant dwelling units is not considered vacant and the use is not considered to be discontinued unless all units in the structure are vacant.
    4. If a complete application for a permit that would allow the nonconforming use to continue, or that would authorize a change to another nonconforming use, has been submitted before the structure has been vacant for 12 consecutive months, the nonconforming use shall not be considered discontinued unless the permit lapses or the permit is denied. If the permit is denied, the nonconforming use may be reestablished during the six months following the denial.
3. A nonconforming use that is disrupted by fire, act of nature, or other causes beyond the control of the owners may be resumed. Any structure occupied by the nonconforming use may be rebuilt in accordance with applicable codes and regulations to the same or smaller configuration existing immediately prior to the time the structure was damaged or destroyed.

    1. Where replacement of a structure or portion of a structure is necessary in order to resume the use, action toward that replacement must be commenced within twelve (12) months after the demolition or destruction of the structure. Action toward replacement shall include application for a building permit or other significant activity directed toward the replacement of the structure. If this action is not commenced within this time limit, the nonconforming use shall lapse.
    2. When the structure containing the nonconforming use is located in a PSM zone, the Pioneer Square Preservation Board shall review the exterior design of the structure before it is rebuilt to ensure reasonable compatibility with the design and character of other structures in the Pioneer Square Preservation District.

#### 23.42.106 - Expansion of nonconforming uses

1. A structure occupied by a nonconforming residential use may be maintained, repaired, renovated or structurally altered, but may not be expanded or extended, except:

    1. As otherwise required by law or as necessary to improve access for the elderly or disabled; or
    2. To construct or modify minor structural features on the principal structure including, but not limited to, exterior decks and balconies, bay windows, dormers, eaves and solar collectors added to a principal structure, or a new or expanded accessory structure may be constructed; provided that the addition or new accessory structure conforms to the development standards of the zone.
    3. To construct or expand an accessory structure, provided that the addition or new structure conforms to the development standards of the zone.
2. In addition to the standards in subsection 23.42.106.A, a structure in a single-family zone occupied by a nonconforming residential use may be allowed to expand subject to the following:

    1. The number of dwelling units shall not be increased, except as may be allowed pursuant to Section 23.40.040 or Section 23.44.015.
    2. For a nonconforming residential use that is not a multifamily use, except as may be allowed pursuant to Section 23.40.040 or Section 23.44.015, the number of residents may not be increased beyond the maximum number that was allowed by the standards of the zone at the time of approval; if originally permitted by conditional use, the number shall not be allowed to increase above the number permitted by the conditional use approval.
    3. An expansion of no more than 500 square feet of gross floor area, meeting the development standards for single-family construction and not exceeding the average height of the closest principal structures on either side, is allowed.
    4. An expansion greater than 500 square feet of gross floor area and/or exceeding the average height of the closest principal structures on either side may be approved by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections through a special exception, Type II Master Use Permit, if the proposed expansion meets the development standards for single-family construction and is compatible with surrounding development in terms of:

        1. Architectural character;
        2. Existing streetscape and pattern of yards; and
        3. Scale and proportion of principal structures.
    5. If an addition proposed under subsections 23.42.106.B.3 or 23.42.106.B.4 would require additional parking under the requirements of Section 23.54.015 for multifamily structures, that additional parking must be provided.
3. In multifamily zones, except in Lowrise 1 (LR1) zones, dwelling units may be added to a structure containing one or more nonconforming uses, even if in a structure nonconforming to development standards; provided that limitations on density shall apply. The structure may be expanded or extended, provided that the expansion or extension shall be for residential use, shall conform to the development standards of the zone, and shall not cause an already nonconforming structure to become more nonconforming to development standards.
4. A nonconforming nonresidential use shall not be expanded or extended, except as follows:

    1. A structure occupied by a nonconforming nonresidential use may be maintained, repaired, renovated or structurally altered but shall not be expanded or extended except as otherwise required by law, as necessary to improve access for the elderly or disabled or as specifically permitted elsewhere in this Code.
    2. In the Seattle Mixed zone, general manufacturing uses exceeding twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet of gross floor area and heavy manufacturing uses may be expanded or extended by an amount of gross floor area not to exceed twenty (20) percent of the existing gross floor area of the use, provided that this exception may be applied only once to any individual business establishment.
5. For purposes of this section, live-work units shall be deemed a nonresidential use.
6. Structures meeting applicable development standards for institutions in the applicable zone may be added to existing cemeteries, but existing cemeteries shall not be expanded in size. For purposes of this section, a change in a cemetery boundary is not considered an expansion in size and is permitted provided that:

    1. the change does not result in a net increase in the land area occupied by the cemetery;
    2. the land being added to the cemetery is contiguous to the existing cemetery and is not separated from the existing cemetery by a public street or alley whether or not improved; and
    3. the use of the land being added as a cemetery will not result in the loss of housing.

#### 23.42.108 - Change from nonconforming use to conforming use

1. In any zone, a nonconforming use may be converted to any conforming use if all development standards are met.
2. In single-family zones, a nonconforming use may be converted to single-family dwelling unit, even if all development standards are not met.
3. In multifamily zones, a nonconforming nonresidential use may be converted to residential use even though all development standards are not met, if:

    1. any applicable limits on density are met;
    2. any nonconformity with respect to parking is not increased as a result of the conversion; and
    3. in LR1 zones the total number of dwelling units in an apartment is limited to three.
4. In commercial zones, a nonconforming use may be converted to any conforming use even if all development standards are not met.
5. In industrial zones, a nonconforming use may be converted to any conforming use even if all development standards are not met, provided that parking nonconformity shall not be increased as a result of the conversion.

#### 23.42.110 - Change from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use

A nonconforming use may be converted by an administrative conditional use authorization to another use not otherwise permitted in the zone subject to the following limitations and conditions.


1. In single-family and residential small lot zones, a nonconforming multifamily residential use may not be converted to any nonresidential use not otherwise permitted in the zone.
2. The proposed new use must be no more detrimental to properties in the zone and vicinity than the existing use. This determination shall be based on consideration of the following factors:

    1. The zones in which both the existing use and the proposed new use are allowed;
    2. The number of employees and clients associated or expected with the proposed use;
    3. The relative parking, traffic, light, glare, noise, odor and similar impacts of the two uses and how these impacts could be mitigated.
3. The existence of a single residential unit, such as a caretaker's or proprietor's unit, accessory to a nonconforming commercial use shall not be treated as having established a residential use, and such a unit may be converted or changed provided that it is the only residential use in the structure and comprises less than half of the total floor area of the structure.
4. Parking requirements for the proposed use shall be determined by the Director.
5. If the new use is permitted, the Director may require mitigation measures, including but not limited to landscaping, sound barriers or fences, mounding or berming, adjustments to yards or parking standards, design modification, or limiting hours of operation.

#### 23.42.112 - Nonconformity to development standards

1. A structure nonconforming to development standards may be maintained, renovated, repaired or structurally altered but may not be expanded or extended in any manner that increases the extent of nonconformity or creates additional nonconformity, except:

    1. any portion of a principal structure in a single family zone that is nonconforming to front and/or rear yard requirements may be increased in height by up to 5 feet, but not to exceed the height limit of the zone, and only to the extent necessary to achieve minimum ceiling height in an existing basement or another floor within the principal structure to conform to the City's regulations for habitable rooms or to accommodate a pitched roof on the principal structure. If the height of a principal structure is being raised to increase ceiling height in a basement or another floor, existing porches or steps may extend into a required yard to the extent necessary to meet Building Code standards, but in no case shall they be located closer than 3 feet to any lot line.
    2. mechanical equipment may be added or replaced, even if nonconformity is created by the addition or replacement, provided that the new mechanical equipment serves the same function as existing equipment;
    3. as otherwise required by law;
    4. as necessary to improve access for the elderly or disabled;
    5. as specifically permitted for nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures elsewhere in this Land Use Code; or
    6. Light poles nonconforming to height standards and located in parks may be moved or may be replaced by new light poles to the same height and configuration as the existing light poles.
2. A structure nonconforming to development standards and occupied by or accessory to a residential use may be rebuilt or replaced but may not be expanded or extended in any manner that increases the extent of nonconformity unless specifically permitted by this code.

    1. A survey by a licensed Washington surveyor, or other documentation acceptable to the Director, documenting the extent of nonconformity and confirming that the plans to rebuild or replace a residential structure create no unpermitted increase in nonconformity shall be required prior to approval of any permit to rebuild or replace a nonconforming residential structure.
    2. Additions to a rebuilt nonconforming residential structure that meet current development standards are allowed.
3. Any structure nonconforming to development standards that is destroyed by fire, act of nature, or other causes beyond the control of the owner, may be rebuilt to the same or smaller configuration existing immediately prior to the time the structure was destroyed.
4. Where replacement of a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure is permitted under this section, action toward that replacement must be commenced within twelve (12) months after the demolition or destruction of the structure, except for a nonconforming structure designated as a Landmark pursuant to Chapter 25.12. Action toward replacement of Landmark structures must be commenced within three (3) years after the demolition or destruction of the structure. Action toward replacement shall include application for a building permit or other significant activity directed toward the replacement of the structure. If this action is not commenced within this time limit, any replacement must conform to the existing development standards.
5. When the structure is located in a PSM zone, the Pioneer Square Preservation Board shall review plans for the exterior design of the structure to ensure compatibility with the design and character of other structures in the Pioneer Square Preservation District.

#### 23.42.114 - Multifamily structures nonconforming to development standards

The following provisions apply to multifamily structures nonconforming to development standards.


1. A multifamily structure nonconforming to development standards in a Lowrise 1 (LR1) zone may be expanded or extended if the expansion or extension conforms to the development standards of the zone and does not cause an already nonconforming structure to become more nonconforming to development standards.
2. Additional residential units may be added to a multifamily structure nonconforming to development standards if the addition conforms to the development standards of the zone and does not cause an already nonconforming structure to become more nonconforming to development standards.

#### 23.42.116 - Downtown structures nonconforming to development standards.

1. Portions of structures that do not conform to the standards for minimum street facade height and/or facade setback limits for the downtown zone in which they are located may be expanded if the expansion reduces the nonconformity as regards one or both of these standards and, in the opinion of the Director, is consistent with the intent of the Code. If the Director determines that greater conformity is not structurally feasible, the expansion may increase the nonconformity in respect to these standards if all other standards are met.
2. Portions of structures that do not conform to the standards for required street-level uses and/or the street facade requirements for transparency, blank facades, or screening of parking for the downtown zone in which they are located may be expanded if:

    1. The expansion does not cause the structure to exceed the base FAR for the zone and the nonconformity is not increased; or
    2. When the nonconformity of the structure as regards these development standards is reduced, expansion of the structure up to the maximum FAR for the zone may be permitted by the Director through the use of the bonus system or transfer of development rights. The appropriate level of expansion and the required reduction or elimination of nonconformity shall be determined by the Director according to the following criteria:

        1. The extent of the proposed expansion,
        2. The impact of the proposed expansion on the pedestrian environment,
        3. The amount of the existing nonconformity, and
        4. The structural feasibility of remodeling the structure to meet these development standards.

#### 23.42.118 - Landmark structures.

1. Landmark structures may be expanded even if the expansion increases the extent of nonconformity, when the Landmarks Board determines that there is no feasible alternative that meets the development standards of the zone while preserving the integrity of the landmark structure.
2. The Director may permit the proposed expansion if it is approved by the Landmarks Board and if:

    1. The expansion does not have a significant adverse effect on the light, air, solar and visual access of properties within a three hundred (300) foot radius; and
    2. The expansion does not adversely affect the pedestrian environment in the vicinity.

#### 23.42.120 - Access easement nonconformity.

A structure located on a lot nonconforming as to access easement requirements may be replaced, provided that the number of dwelling units to which access is provided by the easement shall not be increased and the new structure shall conform to all other development standards of the zone.


#### 23.42.122 - Height nonconformity

1. Single-family and multifamily zones.

    1. In single-family zones, a principal structure nonconforming as to height may be expanded or extended to add eaves, dormers and/or clerestories to an existing pitched roof if the additions are constructed below the highest point of the roof. An existing pitched roof that is above the height limit may not be converted into a flat roof, nor shall the slope of the roof be reduced to less than a 4:12 pitch.
    2. In multifamily zones, a structure nonconforming as to height may be expanded or extended to add eaves, dormers and/or clerestories to an existing pitched roof if the additions are constructed below the highest point of the roof, pursuant to Section 23.45.514. An existing pitched roof that is above the height limit may not be converted into a flat roof, nor shall the slope of the roof be reduced to less than a 6:12 pitch.
2. Structures originally constructed in manufacturing zones, under Seattle Municipal Code Title 24, that exceed the permitted height in zones with height limits of thirty (30) feet, forty (40) feet, or sixty-five (65) feet shall be limited to an FAR (floor area ratio) of two and one-half (2½). Structures that exceed the permitted height in zones allowing heights greater than sixty-five (65) feet shall be limited to the FAR permitted in the respective zones.

#### 23.42.124 - Light and glare standards nonconformity

When nonconforming exterior lighting is replaced, new lighting shall conform to the requirements of the light and glare standards of the respective zone. See subsection 23.44.008.H for single-family zones; Section 23.45.534 for multifamily zones; Section 23.46.020 for residential-commercial zones; Section 23.47A.022 for C zones or NC zones; Section 23.48.075 for SM zones; Section 23.49.025 for downtown zones; and Section 23.50.046 for IB and IC zones.


#### 23.42.126 - Outdoor storage areas nonconformity

1. An outdoor storage area nonconforming as to screening and landscaping shall be required to be screened and landscaped at the time of any structural alteration or expansion of the outdoor storage area or the structure with which it is associated according to the provisions of:

    1. Subsection 23.47A.016.D.2, if located in a NC zone or C zone;

##### 23.44.008 - Development standards for uses permitted outright

1. The development standards set out in this subchapter apply to principal and accessory uses permitted outright in single-family zones.
2. All structures or uses shall be built or established on a lot or lots.
3. Floating homes are subject to the provisions of Chapter 23.60A, Shoreline District, and are also subject to the parking provisions of this Section 23.44.008.
4. An exception from one specific standard does not relieve the applicant from compliance with any other standard.
5. Methods for measurements are provided in Chapter 23.86. Standards for parking access and design are provided in Chapter 23.54.
6. Except for a detached accessory dwelling unit, any structure occupied by a permitted use other than single-family residential use may be converted to single-family residential use even if the structure does not conform to the development standards for single-family structures. Expansions of converted nonconforming structures are regulated by Section 23.42.108. Conversion of structures occupied by nonconforming uses are regulated by Sections 23.42.108 and 23.42.110.
7. Development standards governing lots containing an environmentally critical area or buffer may be modified according to the provisions of Chapter 25.09.
8. Exterior lighting shall be shielded and directed away from residentially zoned lots. The Director may require that the intensity of illumination be limited and that the location of the lighting be changed.
9. Tree Requirements.

    1. Trees are required when single-family dwelling units are constructed. The minimum number of caliper inches of tree required per lot may be met by using either the tree preservation option or tree planting option described in subsections 23.44.008.I.1.a. or I.1.b., or by a combination of preservation and planting. This requirement may be met by planting or preserving street trees in the public right-of-way. Submerged land shall not be included in calculating lot area for purposes of either the tree preservation option or tree planting option.

        1. Tree Preservation Option. For lots over 3,000 square feet, at least 2 caliper inches of existing tree per 1,000 square feet of lot area must be preserved. On lots that are 3,000 square feet or smaller, at least 3 caliper inches of existing tree must be preserved per lot. When this option is used, a tree preservation plan is required.
        2. Tree Planting Option. For lots over 3,000 square feet, at least 2 caliper inches of tree per 1,000 square feet of lot area must be planted. On lots that are 3,000 square feet or smaller, at least 3 caliper inches of tree must be planted per lot.
    2. Tree Measurements. Trees planted to meet the requirements in subsection 23.44.008.I.1 shall be at least 1.5 inches in diameter. The diameter of new trees shall be measured (in caliper inches) 6 inches above the ground. Existing trees shall be measured 4.5 feet above the ground. When an existing tree is 3 to 10 inches in diameter, each 1 inch counts as 1 inch toward meeting the tree requirements in subsection 23.44.008.I.1. When an existing tree is more than 10 inches in diameter, each 1 inch of the tree that is over 10 inches shall count as 3 inches toward meeting the tree requirement.
    3. Tree Preservation Plans. If the tree preservation option is chosen, a tree preservation plan must be submitted and approved. Tree preservation plans shall provide for protection of trees during construction according to standards promulgated by the Director.

##### 23.44.010 - Lot requirements

Submerged lands shall not be counted in calculating the area of lots for the purpose of these minimum lot area requirements, or the exceptions to minimum lot area requirements provided in this Section 23.44.010. A parcel that does not meet the minimum lot area requirements or exceptions of this Section 23.44.010, and that is in common ownership with an abutting lot when the abutting lot is the subject of any permit application, shall be included as a part of the abutting lot for purposes of the permit application.

For purposes of computing maximum lot coverage, only those portions of a lot that measure at least 10 feet in all directions shall be included in lot coverage calculations, except for portions of a lot that are used for access or that are granted a waiver under subsections 23.22.100.D, 23.24.040.B, or 23.28.030.A.4 for the purpose of providing access.


1. Minimum lot area. The minimum lot area shall be as provided in Table A for 23.44.010:
2. Exceptions to minimum lot area requirements. The following exceptions to minimum lot area requirements are allowed, subject to the requirements in subsection 23.44.010.B.2, and further subject to the requirements in subsection 23.44.010.B.3 for any lot less than 3,200 square feet in area:

    1. A lot that does not satisfy the minimum lot area requirements of its zone may be developed or redeveloped under one of the following circumstances:

        1. "The Seventy-Five/Eighty Rule." The Seventy-Five Eighty Rule exception may be applied to allow separate development of lots already in existence in their current configuration, or new lots resulting from a full subdivision, short subdivision or lot boundary adjustment. In order to qualify for this exception, the lot must have an area at least 75 percent of the minimum required for the zone and also at least 80 percent of the mean area of the lots within the same block front, subject to the following provisions:

            1. To be counted as a separate lot for the purposes of calculating the mean area of the lots on a block front, a lot must be entirely within a single-family zone, and must be currently developed as a separate building site or else currently qualify for separate development based on facts in existence as of the date a building permit, full or short subdivision, or lot boundary adjustment application is filed with the Department. The existence of structures or portions of structures on the property that is the subject of the application may be disregarded when the application indicates the structures or portions of structures will be demolished. In cases where this exception is applied for the purpose of a lot boundary adjustment, the calculation shall be based on the existing lots as they are configured before the adjustment.
            2. To be counted as a separate lot for the purposes of calculating the mean area of the lots on a block front, a lot must have at least 10 feet of frontage on the street the calculation is applied to.
            3. Lots developed with institutional uses, parks, or nonconforming nonresidential uses may be excluded from the calculation. There must, however, be at least one lot on the block front used for the calculation other than the property that is the subject of the platting, lot boundary adjustment, or building permit application that this exception is being applied to.
            4. If property is to be subdivided or its lot lines are modified by a lot boundary adjustment that increases the number of lots that qualify for separate development, the property subject to the subdivision, or the lots modified by the lot boundary adjustment, shall be excluded from the block front mean area calculation.
            5. For purposes of this subsection 23.44.010.B.1.a, if the platting pattern is irregular, the Director will determine which lots are included within a block front.
            6. If an existing or proposed lot has frontage on more than one street, the lot may qualify for this exception based on the calculation being applied to any street on which the lot has at least 30 feet of frontage. If a proposed lot has frontage on multiple streets but does not have 30 feet of frontage on any street, the exception may be applied based on the calculation along the street on which the lot has the most frontage, provided the lot has at least 10 feet of frontage on that street. If the lot has less than 30 feet of frontage on any one street but equal frontage on multiple streets, the rule may be applied based on the calculation along any one of the streets, provided the lot has at least 10 feet of frontage on that street.
            7. New lots created pursuant to subsection 23.44.010.B.1.a shall comply with the following standards:

                1. For a lot that is subdivided or short platted, the configuration requirements of subsections 23.22.100.C.3 and 23.24.040.A.9 or with the modification provisions of subsections 23.22.100.D and 23.24.040.B, as applicable; or
                2. For an existing lot that is reconfigured under the provisions of Chapter 23.28, the configuration requirements of subsection 23.28.030.A.3 or with the modification provisions of subsection 23.28.030.A.4.
        2. The lot area deficit is the result of a dedication or sale of a portion of the lot to the City or state for street or highway purposes, payment was received for only that portion of the lot, and the lot area remaining is at least 2,500 square feet.
        3. The lot would qualify as a legal building site under subsection 23.44.010.B but for a reduction in the lot area due to court-ordered adverse possession, and the amount by which the lot was so reduced was less than 10 percent of the former area of the lot. This exception does not apply to lots reduced to less than 2,500 square feet.
        4. "The Historic Lot Exception." The historic lot exception may be applied to allow separate development of lots already in existence if the lot has an area of at least 2,500 square feet, and was established as a separate building site in the public records of the county or City prior to July 24, 1957, by deed, platting, or building permit. The qualifying lot shall be subject to the following provisions:

            1. A lot is considered to have been established as a separate building site by deed if the lot was held under separate ownership from all abutting lots for at least one year after the date the recorded deed transferred ownership.
            2. If two contiguous lots have been held in common ownership at any time after January 18, 1987, and a principal structure extends onto or over both lots, neither lot qualifies for the exception. If the principal structure does not extend onto or over both lots, but both lots were required to meet development standards other than parking requirements in effect at the time the structure was built or expanded, neither lot qualifies for the exception unless the vacant lot is not needed to meet development standards other than parking requirements. If the combined property fronts on multiple streets, the orientation of the principal structure shall not be considered when determining if it could have been built to the same configuration without using the vacant lot or lots as part of the principal structure's building site.
            3. Lots that do not otherwise qualify for this exception cannot qualify as a result of all or part of a principal structure being removed or destroyed by fire or act of nature that occurred on or after January 18, 1987. Lots may, however, qualify as a result of removing from the principal structure minor features that do not contain enclosed interior space, including but not limited to eaves and unenclosed decks.
            4. If parking for an existing principal structure on one lot has been provided on an abutting lot and parking is required under Chapter 23.54 the required parking for the existing house shall be relocated onto the same lot as the existing principal structure in order for either lot to qualify for the exception.
        5. The lot is within a clustered housing planned development pursuant to Section 23.44.024, a planned residential development pursuant to Section 23.44.034, or a development approved as an environmentally critical areas conditional use pursuant to Section 25.09.260.
        6. If a lot qualifies for an exception to the lot area requirement under subsection 23.44.010.B.1.a, 23.44.010.B.1.b, 23.44.010.B.1.c, 23.44.010.B.1.d, or 23.44.010.B.1.e, the boundaries between that lot and contiguous lots on the same block face that also qualify for separate development may be adjusted through the lot boundary adjustment process if the adjustment maintains the existing lot areas, increases the area of a qualifying substandard lot without reducing another lot below the minimum permitted lot area, or causes the areas of the lots to become more equal provided the number of parcels qualifying for separate development is not increased. Lots resulting from a lot boundary adjustment that do not meet the minimum lot area requirement must qualify for an exception to that requirement.
    2. Limitations

        1. Development may occur on a substandard lot containing a riparian corridor, a wetland and wetland buffer, or a steep slope and steep slope buffer pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 25.09, Regulations for environmentally critical areas or containing priority freshwater habitat or priority saltwater habitat described in Section 23.60A.160, if the following conditions apply:

            1. The substandard lot is not held in common ownership with an abutting lot or lots at any time after October 31, 1992, or
            2. The substandard lot is held in common ownership with an abutting lot or lots, or has been held in common ownership at any time after October 31, 1992, if proposed and future development will not intrude into the environmentally critical area or buffer or priority freshwater habitat or priority saltwater habitat described in Section 23.60A.160.
        2. Lots on totally submerged lands do not qualify for any minimum lot area exceptions.
    3. Special exception review for lots less than 3,200 square feet in area. A special exception Type II review as provided for in Section 23.76.004 is required for separate development of any lot with an area less than 3,200 square feet that qualifies for any lot area exception in subsection 23.44.010.B.1. The special exception application shall be subject to the following provisions:

        1. The depth of any structure on the lot shall not exceed two times the width of the lot. If a side yard easement is provided according to subsection 23.44.014.D.3, the portion of the easement within 5 feet of the structure on the lot qualifying under this provision may be treated as a part of that lot solely for the purpose of determining the lot width for purposes of complying with this subsection 23.44.010.B.2.c.
        2. Windows in a proposed principal structure facing an existing abutting lot that is developed with a house shall be placed in manner that takes into consideration the interior privacy in abutting houses, provided that this provision shall not prohibit placing a window in any room of the proposed house.
        3. In approving a special exception review, additional conditions may be imposed that address window placement to address interior privacy of existing abutting houses.
3. Maximum lot coverage. The maximum lot coverage permitted for principal and accessory structures is as provided in Table B for 23.44.010:
4. Lot coverage exceptions

    1. Lots abutting alleys. For purposes of computing the lot coverage only:

        1. The area of a lot with an alley or alleys abutting any lot line may be increased by one-half of the width of the abutting alley or alleys.
        2. The total lot area for any lot may not be increased by the provisions of this Section 23.44.010 by more than 10 percent.
    2. Special structures and portions of structures. The following structures and portions of structures are not counted in lot coverage calculations:

        1. Access bridges. Uncovered, unenclosed pedestrian bridges 5 feet or less in width and of any height necessary for access;
        2. Barrier-free access. Ramps or other access for the disabled or elderly that comply with Washington State Building Code, Chapter 11;
        3. Decks. Decks or parts of a deck that are 36 inches or less above existing grade;
        4. Freestanding structures and bulkheads. Fences, freestanding walls, bulkheads, signs and other similar structures;
        5. Underground structures. An underground structure, or underground portion of a structure;
        6. Eaves and gutters. The first 36 inches of eaves and gutters that project from principal and accessory structures;

        3. On flat roofs, projections are set back at least 4 feet from exterior walls.

##### 23.44.013 - Transportation concurrency level-of-service standards.

Proposed uses in single-family zones shall meet the transportation concurrency level-of-service standards prescribed in Chapter 23.52.


##### 23.44.014 - Yards

Yards are required for every lot in a single-family zone. A yard that is larger than the minimum size may be provided.


The minimum required rear yard for a lot having a depth of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be twenty (20) percent of the lot depth and in no case less than ten (10) feet.

When the required rear yard abuts upon an alley along a lot line, the centerline of the alley between the side lot lines extended shall be assumed to be a lot line for purposes of the provision of rear yard and the determination of lot depth; provided, that at no point shall the principal structure be closer than five (5) feet to the alley.

When a lot in any single-family zone abuts at the rear lot line upon a public park, playground or open water, not less than fifty (50) feet in width, the rear yard need not exceed the depth of twenty (20) feet.


1. Front Yards.

    1. The front yard depth shall be either the average of the front yards of the single-family structures on either side or 20 feet, whichever is less.
    2. On any lot where the natural gradient or slope, as measured from the front line of the lot for a distance of 60 feet or the full depth of the lot, whichever is less, is in excess of 35 percent, the required front yard depth shall be either 20 feet less one foot for each one percent of gradient or slope in excess of 35 percent, or the average of the front yards on either side, whichever is less.
    3. In the case of a through lot, each yard abutting a street, except a side yard, shall be a front yard. Rear yard provisions shall not apply to the lot, except pursuant to Section 23.40.030 or 23.40.035.
    4. A larger yard may be required in order to meet the provisions of Section 23.53.015, Improvement requirements for existing streets in residential and commercial zones.
2. Rear Yards. The rear yard shall be twenty-five (25) feet.
3. Side yards. The side yard shall be 5 feet except as follows:

    1. In the case of a reversed corner lot, the key lot of which is in a single-family zone, the width of the side yard on the street side of the reversed corner lot shall not be less than 10 feet; or
    2. If any side street lot line is a continuation of the front lot line of an abutting single-family zoned lot, whether or not separated by an alley, the width of the street side yard shall not be less than 10 feet.
4. Exceptions from standard yard requirements. No structure shall be placed in a required yard except pursuant to the following:

    1. Garages. Garages may be located in required yard subject to the standards of Section 23.44.016.
    2. Certain Accessory Structures in Side and Rear Yards.

        1. Except for detached accessory dwelling units, any accessory structure that complies with the requirements of Section 23.44.040 may be constructed in a side yard that abuts the rear or side yard of another lot, or in that portion of the rear yard of a reversed corner lot within 5 feet of the key lot and not abutting the front yard of the key lot, upon recording with the King County Department of Records and Elections an agreement to this effect between the owners of record of the abutting properties.
        2. Except for detached accessory dwelling units, any detached accessory structure that complies with the requirements of Section 23.44.040 may be located in a rear yard, provided that on a reversed corner lot, no accessory structure shall be located in that portion of the required rear yard that abuts the required front yard of the adjoining key lot, nor shall the accessory structure be located closer than 5 feet from the key lot's side lot line unless the provisions of subsections 23.44.014.D.2.a or 23.44.016.D.9 apply.
    3. A single-family structure may extend into one side yard if an easement is provided along the side or rear lot line of the abutting lot, sufficient to leave a 10 foot separation between that structure and any principal structure on the abutting lot. The 10 foot separation shall be measured from the wall of the principal structure that is proposed to extend into a side yard to the wall of the principal structure on the abutting lot.

        1. No structure or portion of a structure may be built on either lot within the 10 foot separation, except as provided in this section.
        2. Accessory structures and features of and projections from principal structures, such as porches, eaves, and chimneys are permitted in the 10 foot separation area if allowed by subsection 23.44.014.D. For purposes of calculating the distance a structure or feature may project into the 10 foot separation, assume the property line is 5 feet from the wall of the principal structure proposed to extend into a side yard and consider the 5 feet between the wall and the assumed property line to be the required side yard.
        3. No portion of any structure, including any projection, shall cross the property line.
        4. The easement shall be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections. The easement shall provide access for normal maintenance activities to the principal structure on the lot with less than the required 5 foot side yard.
    4. Certain Additions. Certain additions may extend into a required yard if the existing single-family structure is already nonconforming with respect to that yard. The presently nonconforming portion must be at least 60 percent of the total width of the respective facade of the structure prior to the addition. The line formed by the existing nonconforming wall of the structure is the limit to which any additions may be built, except as described below. Additions may extend up to the height limit and may include basement additions. New additions to the nonconforming wall or walls shall comply with the following requirements (Exhibit A for 23.44.014):

        1. Side Yard. If the addition is a side wall, the existing wall line may be continued by the addition except that in no case shall the addition be closer than 3 feet to the side lot line;
        2. Rear Yard. If the addition is a rear wall, the existing wall line may be continued by the addition except that in no case shall the addition be closer than 20 feet to the rear lot line or centerline of an alley abutting the rear lot line;
        3. Front Yard. If the addition is a front wall, the existing wall line may be continued by the addition except that in no case shall the addition be closer than 15 feet to the front lot line;
        4. If the nonconforming wall of the single-family structure is not parallel or is otherwise irregular, relative to the lot line, then the Director shall determine the limit of the wall extension, except that the wall extension shall not be located closer than specified in subsections 23.44.014.D.4.a, b, and c.
        5. Roof eaves, gutters, and chimneys on such additions may extend an additional 18 inches into a required yard, but in no case shall such features be closer than 2 feet to the side lot line.
    5. Uncovered porches or steps. Uncovered, unenclosed porches or steps may project into any required yard, if they are no higher than 4 feet above existing grade, no closer than 3 feet to any side lot line, no wider than 6 feet and project no more than 6 feet into required front or rear yards. The width of porches and steps are to be calculated separately.

##### 23.44.015 - Allowance for larger households.

The Director may allow larger numbers of unrelated persons to live together in a household than would otherwise be permitted in two situations: (1) through a grant of special accommodation, available only to domestic violence shelters as defined in Chapter 23.84A, and (2) through a grant of reasonable accommodation, available only to persons with handicaps as defined by federal law.


1. The Director may grant special accommodation to individuals who are residents of domestic violence shelters in order to allow them to live together in groups of between nine (9) and fifteen (15) persons in single-family dwelling units, according to the following:

    1. An application for special accommodation must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director:

        1. That the needs of the residents of the domestic violence shelter make it necessary for the residents to live together in a group of the size proposed; and
        2. That adverse impacts on the neighborhood from the increased density will be mitigated.
    2. The Director shall take into account the size, shape and location of the dwelling unit and lot, the traffic and parking conditions on adjoining and neighboring streets, the vehicle usage to be expected from residents, staff and visitors, and any other circumstances the Director determines to be relevant as to whether the proposed increase in density will adversely impact the neighborhood.
    3. An applicant shall modify the proposal as needed to mitigate any adverse impacts identified by the Director or the Director shall deny the request for special accommodation.
    4. A grant of special accommodation permits a dwelling to be inhabited only according to the terms and conditions of the applicant's proposal and the Director's decision. If circumstances materially change or the number of residents increases, or if adverse impacts occur that were not adequately mitigated, the Director shall revoke the grant of special accommodation and require the number of people in the dwelling to be reduced to eight unless a new grant of special accommodation is issued for a modified proposal.
    5. A decision to grant special accommodation is a Type 1 Master Use Permit decision (See Chapter 23.76) that shall be recorded with the King County Division of Records and Elections.
2. The Director may grant reasonable accommodation to individuals who are handicapped within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 3602, in order for them to live in a household of more than eight (8) persons, according to the following:

    1. An applicant for reasonable accommodation must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that the handicap of the proposed residents makes it necessary for them to live in a household of the size proposed in order to have equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
    2. The Director shall determine what adverse land use impacts, including cumulative impacts, if any, would result from granting the proposed accommodation. The Director shall take into account the size, shape and location of the dwelling unit and lot; the traffic and parking conditions on adjoining and neighboring streets; vehicle usage to be expected from residents, staff and visitors; and any other circumstances the Director determines to be relevant.
    3. The Director shall consider the applicant's need for accommodation in light of the anticipated land use impacts, and the Director may impose conditions in order to make the accommodation reasonable in light of those impacts.
    4. A grant of reasonable accommodation permits a dwelling to be inhabited only according to the terms and conditions of the applicant's proposal and the Director's decision. If the Director determines that the accommodation has become unreasonable because circumstances have changed or adverse land use impacts have occurred that were not anticipated, the Director shall rescind or modify the decision to grant reasonable accommodation.
    5. A decision to grant reasonable accommodation is a Type 1 Master Use Permit decision (see Chapter 23.76) that shall be recorded with the King County Division of Records and Elections.
    6. Nothing herein shall prevent the Director from granting reasonable accommodation to the full extent required by federal or state law.

Any use which was previously authorized by a conditional use permit but which has been discontinued shall not be reestablished or recommenced except pursuant to a new conditional use permit, provided that such permit is required for the use at the time re-establishment or recommencement is proposed. The following shall constitute conclusive evidence that the conditional use has been discontinued:

Property which is vacant, except for dead storage of materials or equipment of the conditional use, shall not be considered as being devoted to the authorized conditional use. The expiration of licenses necessary for the conditional use shall be evidence that the property is not being devoted to the conditional use. A conditional use in a multifamily structure or a multitenant commercial structure shall not be considered as discontinued unless all units are either vacant or devoted to another use.


    1. A permit to change the use of the property has been issued and the new use has been established; or
    2. The property has not been devoted to the authorized conditional use for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive months.
6. Minor structural work that does not increase usable floor area or seating capacity and that does not exceed the development standards applicable to the use shall not be considered an expansion and does not require approval as a conditional use, unless the work would exceed the height limit of the zone for uses permitted outright. Such work includes but is not limited to roof repair or replacement and construction of uncovered decks and porches, facilities for barrier-free access, bay windows, dormers, and eaves.

    2. The establishment of a child care center in a legally established institution devoted to the care or instruction of children which does not violate any condition of approval of the existing institutional use and does not require structural expansion shall not be considered a new use or an expansion of the institutional use.
    3. Institutions seeking to establish or expand on property that is developed with residential structures may expand their campus up to a maximum of 2½ acres. An institution campus may be established or expanded beyond 2½ acres if the property proposed for the expansion is substantially vacant land.
5. Dispersion.

    1. The lot line of any proposed new or expanding institution, other than child care centers locating in legally established institutions, shall be located six hundred (600) feet or more from any lot line of any other institution in a residential zone, with the following exceptions:

        1. An institution may expand even though it is within six hundred (600) feet of a public school if the public school is constructed on a new site subsequent to December 12, 1985.
        2. A proposed institution may be located less than six hundred (600) feet from a lot line of another institution if the Director determines that the intent of the dispersion criteria is achieved due to the presence of physical elements such as bodies of water, large open spaces or topographical breaks or other elements such as arterials, freeways or nonresidential uses, which provide substantial separation from other institutions.
    2. A proposed child-care center serving not more than twenty-five (25) children which does not meet the criteria of subsection E1 of this section may be permitted to locate less than six hundred (600) feet from a lot line of another institution if the Director determines that, together with the nearby institution(s), the proposed child care center would not:

        1. Create physical scale and bulk incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood;
        2. Create traffic safety hazards;
        3. Create or significantly increase identified parking shortages; or
        4. Significantly increase noise levels to the detriment of surrounding residents.
6. Demolition of Residential Structures. No residential structure shall be demolished nor shall its use be changed to provide for parking. This prohibition may be waived if the demolition or change of use proposed is necessary to meet the parking requirements of this Land Use Code and if alternative locations would have greater noise, odor, light and glare or traffic impacts on surrounding property in residential use. If the demolition or change of use is proposed for required parking, the Director may consider waiver of parking requirements in order to preserve the residential structure and/or use. The waiver may include, but is not limited to, a reduction in the number of required parking spaces and a waiver of parking development standards such as location or screening.
7. Reuse of Existing Structures. Existing structures may be converted to institution use if the yard requirements for institutions are met. Existing structures which do not meet these yard requirements may be permitted to convert to institution use, provided that the Director may require additional mitigating measures to reduce impacts of the proposed use on surrounding properties.
8. Noise and Odors. For the purpose of reducing potential noise and odor impacts, the Director shall consider the location on the lot of the proposed institution, on-site parking, outdoor recreational areas, trash and refuse storage areas, ventilating mechanisms, sports facilities and other noise-generating and odor-generating equipment, fixtures or facilities. The institution shall be designed and operated in compliance with the Noise Ordinance, Chapter 25.08.

In order to mitigate identified noise and/or odor impacts, the Director may require measures such as landscaping, sound barriers or fences, mounding or berming, adjustments to yard or parking development standards, design modifications, setting hours of operation for facilities or other similar measures.

9. Landscaping

    1. The Director shall promulgate rules to foster the long-term health, viability, and coverage of plantings. The rules shall address, at a minimum, the type and size of plants, spacing of plants, use of drought-tolerant plants, and access to light and air for plants. All landscaping provided to meet the requirements of this Section 23.44.022 shall comply with these rules.
    2. Landscaping that achieves a Green Factor score of 0.3 or greater, pursuant to Section 23.86.019, is required for any lot with:

        1. development containing more than four new dwelling units;
        2. development, either a new structure or an addition to an existing structure, containing more than 4,000 new square feet of non-residential uses; or
        3. any parking lot containing more than 20 new parking spaces for automobiles.
10. Light and Glare. Exterior lighting shall be shielded or directed away from adjacent residentially zoned lots. The Director may also require that the area and intensity of illumination, the location or angle of illumination be limited.

Nonreflective surfaces shall be used to help reduce glare.

11. Bulk and siting

    1. Lot area. If the proposed site is more than one acre in size, the Director may require the following and similar development standards:

        1. For lots with unusual configuration or uneven boundaries, the proposed principal structures be located so that changes in potential and existing development patterns on the block or blocks within which the institution is located are kept to a minimum;
        2. For lots with large street frontage in relationship to their size, the proposed institution reflect design and architectural features associated with adjacent residentially-zoned block fronts in order to provide continuity of the block front and to integrate the proposed structures with residential structures and uses in the immediate area.
    2. Yards. Yards of institutions shall be as required for uses permitted outright pursuant to Section 23.44.014, provided that no structure other than freestanding walls, fences, bulkheads or similar structures shall be closer than 10 feet to the side lot line. If the Director finds that a reduced setback will not significantly increase project impacts, including but not limited to noise, odor, and the scale of the structure in relation to nearby buildings, the sideyard setback may be reduced to 5 feet. Fences and freestanding walls of utility services uses, regulated under this Section 23.44.022 pursuant to Section 23.51A.002, shall be set back from the street lot line a minimum of 10 feet, and landscaping shall be provided between the fence or wall and the right-of-way. The Director may reduce this setback after finding that the reduced setback will not significantly increase project impacts, including but not limited to noise, odor, and the scale of the fence, wall, or structure in relation to nearby buildings. Acceptable methods to reduce fence or wall impacts include changes in the height, design or construction of the fence or wall, including the use of materials, architectural detailing, artwork, vegetated trellises, decorative fencing, or similar features to provide visual interest facing the street lot line. Fences and walls may obstruct or allow views to the interior of a site. Where site dimensions and conditions allow, applicants are encouraged to provide both a landscaped setback between the fence or wall and the right-of-way, and a fence or wall that provides visual interest facing the street lot line, through the height, design or construction of the fence or wall, including the use of materials, architectural detailing, artwork, vegetated trellises, decorative fencing, or similar features.
    3. Institutions Located on Lots in More Than One (1) Zone Classification. For lots which include more than one (1) zone classification, single-family zone provisions shall apply only to the single-family-zoned lot area involved.
    4. Height Limit.

        1. Religious symbols for religious institutions may extend an additional twenty-five (25) feet above the height limit.
        2. For gymnasiums and auditoriums that are accessory to an institution the maximum height shall be thirty-five (35) feet if portions of the structure above thirty-five (35) feet are set back at least twenty (20) feet from all property lines. Pitched roofs on a gymnasium or auditorium which have a slope of not less than four to twelve (4:12) may extend ten (10) feet above the thirty-five (35) foot height limit. No portion of a shed roof on a gymnasium or an auditorium shall be permitted to extend beyond the thirty-five (35) foot height limit under this provision.
    5. Facade Scale. If any facade of a new or expanding institution exceeds thirty (30) feet in length, the Director may require that facades adjacent to the street or a residentially zoned lot be developed with design features intended to minimize the appearance of bulk. Design features which may be required include, but are not limited to, modulation, architectural features, landscaping or increased yards.
12. Parking and Loading Berth Requirements.

    1. Quantity and Location of Off-street Parking.

An existing accessory structure that is not located in a required front yard, or that is located in a front yard where Section 23.40.030 or 23.40.035 applies, may be converted into a detached accessory dwelling unit if the structure complies with the minimum standards set forth in Sections 22.206.010 through 22.206.140 of the Housing and Building Maintenance Code and with the Seattle Residential Code, if work requiring a permit is performed on the structure or has previously been performed without a permit. The Director may allow an exception to one or more of the development standards for accessory dwelling units contained in subsection 23.44.041.A.4 and standards a through f, h, i, and j listed in Table B for 23.44.041, provided the conversion does not increase the structure's nonconformity with the standard and the applicant can demonstrate that the accessory structure was constructed prior to June 1, 1999, as an accessory structure. If an accessory structure constructed prior to June 1, 1999, was replaced to the same configuration in accordance with the standards of Section 23.42.112, then the replacement structure also qualifies for conversion under this subsection 23.44.041.B.3. For purposes of this subsection 23.44.041.B.3, the term "conversion" means either keeping the accessory structure intact or removing and rebuilding the accessory structure, provided that any expansion or relocation of the accessory structure complies with the development standards for detached accessory dwelling units.
The covenant shall run with the land and be binding upon the property owner, his/her heirs and assigns, and upon any parties subsequently acquiring any right, title or interest in the property. The covenant shall be in a form prescribed by the Director that includes the legal description of the principal use lot. The property owner(s) shall return the original covenant with recording stamp to the Department before the building permit for the accessory dwelling unit is issued.


1. Covenant release. At the request of a property owner and after an inspection finding that an accessory dwelling unit has been removed from the owner's property, the Department shall record a release of any previously recorded covenant for that accessory dwelling unit.

1. Accessory dwelling units, general provisions. The Director may authorize an accessory dwelling unit, and that dwelling unit may be used as a residence, only under the following conditions:

    1. A lot with or proposed for a single-family dwelling may have no more than one accessory dwelling unit.
    2. The owner(s) of the lot shall comply with the owner occupancy requirements of subsection 23.44.041.C.
    3. Any number of related persons may occupy each unit in a single-family dwelling unit with an accessory dwelling unit; provided that, if unrelated persons occupy either unit, the total number of persons occupying both units may not altogether exceed eight.
    4. All accessory dwelling units are required to meet the development standards in Table A for 23.44.041, unless modified in subsection 23.44.041.B:

An owner with at least a 50 percent interest in the property must occupy either the principal dwelling unit or the accessory dwelling unit for six or more months of each calendar year as the owner's permanent residence. The Director may waive this requirement for up to three years if a letter is submitted that provides evidence to the Director showing good cause why the requirement for owner occupancy should be waived. Good cause may include job dislocation, sabbatical leave, education, or illness.
    2. Violation. If an owner is unable or unwilling to fulfill the requirements of subsection 23.44.041.C.1, the owner shall remove those features of the accessory dwelling unit that make it a dwelling unit. Failure to do so will constitute a violation of this Title 23 and the owner will be subject to penalties pursuant to Sections 23.90.018, 23.90.019 and 23.90.020.
    3. Covenant recording. Prior to issuance of a permit establishing an accessory dwelling unit, the owner(s) shall sign under oath and record in the King County Recorder a covenant by the owner(s) to the City of Seattle stating that the owner(s) agree to restrict use of the principal and accessory dwelling units in compliance with the requirements of this subsection 23.44.041.C and notify all prospective purchasers of those requirements. Falsely certifying to the terms of the covenant or failure to comply with the terms of the covenant is subject to penalties pursuant to Sections 23.90.018, 23.90.019 and 23.90.020.

![23-45-510.png](./images/23-45-510.png)


Exhibit A forArea exempt from FAR


1. For rowhouse and townhouse developments and apartments that qualify for the higher FAR limit shown in Table A for 23.45.510, floor area within a structure or portion of a structure that is partially above grade, is used for parking or other accessory uses, and has no additional stories above, if the following conditions are met:

    1. The average height of the exterior walls enclosing the floor area does not exceed one story, measured from existing or finished grade, whichever is lower;
    2. The roof area above the exempt floor area is predominantly flat, is used as amenity area, and meets the standards for amenity area at ground level in Section 23.45.522;
    3. At least 25 percent of the perimeter of the amenity area on the roof above the floor area is not enclosed by the walls of the structure.
2. Enclosed common amenity area in HR zones.
3. As an allowance for mechanical equipment, in any structure more than 85 feet in height, 3.5 percent of the gross floor area that is not exempt under this subsection 23.45.510.E.
4. In HR zones, ground floor commercial uses meeting the requirements of Section 23.45.532, if the street level of the structure containing the commercial uses has a minimum floor to floor height of 13 feet and a minimum depth of 15 feet.

1. General provisions

    1. All gross floor area not exempt under subsection 23.45.510.E, including the area of stair penthouses with enclosed floor space, counts toward the maximum gross floor area allowed under the FAR limits.
    2. The applicable FAR limit applies to the total non-exempt gross floor area of all structures on the lot.
    3. If a lot is in more than one zone, the FAR limit for each zone applies to the portion of the lot located in that zone, and the floor area on the portion of the lot with the lower FAR limit may not exceed the amount that would be permitted if it were a separate lot.
2. FAR limits in LR zones. FAR limits apply in LR zones as shown in Table A for 23.45.510, provided that if the LR zone designation includes an incentive zoning suffix, then the applicant shall comply with Chapter 23.58A, Incentive Provisions, to obtain gross floor area exceeding that allowed by the FAR shown in the suffix designation. In LR zones the following standards apply to the calculation of gross floor area for application of FAR limits:

    1. Exterior corridors, breezeways, and stairways that provide building circulation and access to dwelling units or sleeping rooms, are included in gross floor area.
    2. Balconies, patios, and decks that are associated with a single dwelling unit or sleeping room and that are not used for common circulation, and ground-level walking paths, are excluded from gross floor area.
    3. Common walls separating individual rowhouse and townhouse dwelling units are considered to be exterior walls.
3. In LR zones, in order to qualify for the higher FAR limit shown in Table A for 23.45.510, the following standards shall be met:

    1. Green building performance standards

        1. Applicants shall make a commitment that the structure will meet green building performance standards by earning a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating, certification by the Passive House Institute U. S., or the Passive House Institute, or a Built Green 4-star rating of the Master Builders Association of King and Snohomish Counties, except that an applicant who is applying for funding from the Washington State Housing Trust Fund and/or the Seattle Office of Housing to develop new affordable housing, may elect to meet green building performance standards by meeting the Washington Evergreen Sustainable Development Standards (ESDS). The standards referred to in this subsection 23.45.510.C.1.a are those identified in Section 23.45.526, and Section 23.45.526 shall apply as if the application were for new development gaining extra residential floor area.
        2. If a site contains existing structures that were developed under the Land Use Code in place prior to April 19, 2011, the existing structures and any additions to those structures are not required to be upgraded to current green building performance standards for the higher FAR limits to apply to those structures. Any entirely new structure proposed to be built on the lot shall meet current green building performance standards to gain the higher FAR limit. If a structure is developed under the Land Use Code in place as of or after April 19, 2011, and was not built to the higher FAR, then in order for the structure or addition to gain the higher FAR, the structure shall be updated to current green building performance standards.
    2. For all categories of residential use, if the lot abuts an alley and the alley is used for access, improvements to the alley shall be required as provided in subsections 23.53.030.E and 23.53.030.F, except that the alley shall be paved rather than improved with crushed rock, even for lots containing fewer than ten dwelling units.
    3. Parking location if parking is provided

        1. For rowhouse and townhouse developments, parking shall be totally enclosed within the same structure as the residential use, located in a structure or portion of a structure that meets the requirements of subsection 23.45.510.E.5, or located in a parking area or structure at the rear of the lot. A parking area not within a structure that is located at the rear of the lot shall be located behind all structures except, if accessed from an alley, the parking area may be located no closer to the front lot line than 50 percent of the lot depth.
        2. For apartments, parking may either:

            1. be totally enclosed within the same structure as the residential use; or
            2. on lots located outside of urban centers, urban villages, and the Station Area Overlay District, be located off an alley at the rear of the lot, provided that all surface parking is limited to a single row of spaces along the alley and access to each surface parking space is taken directly from the alley.
    4. Access to parking if parking is provided

        1. Access to required barrier-free parking spaces may be from either a street or an alley. Subsections 23.45.510.C.4.b, 23.45.510.C.4.c, and 23.45.510.C.4.d do not apply to required barrier-free parking spaces.
        2. If the lot abuts an alley, access to parking shall be from the alley, unless one or more of the conditions in subsection 23.45.536.C.2 are met.
        3. If access cannot be provided from an alley, access shall be from a street if the following conditions are met:

            1. On corner lots, the driveway shall abut and run parallel to the rear lot line of the lot or a side lot line that is not a street lot line.
            2. On a non-corner lot, there is no more than one driveway per 160 feet of street frontage.
        4. If access to parking does not meet one of the standards in this subsection 23.45.510.C.4, or if an exception is granted that allows parking access from both an alley and a street pursuant to subsection 23.45.536.C, the lower FAR limit on Table A for 23.45.510 applies.
4. FAR limits in MR and HR zones. FAR limits apply to all structures and lots in MR and HR zones as shown in Table B for 23.45.510, provided that if the MR and HR zone designations include an incentive zoning suffix, then the applicant shall comply with Chapter 23.58A, Incentive provisions, to obtain gross floor area exceeding that allowed by the FAR shown in the suffix designation.
5. The following floor area is exempt from FAR limits:

    1. All underground stories.
    2. The floor area contained in a landmark structure subject to controls and incentives imposed by a designating ordinance, if the owner of the landmark has executed and recorded an agreement acceptable in form and content to the Landmarks Preservation Board, providing for the restoration and maintenance of the historically significant features of the structure, except that this exemption does not apply to a lot from which a transfer of development potential (TDP) has been made under Chapter 23.58A, and does not apply for purposes of determining TDP available for transfer under Chapter 23.58A.
    3. The floor area contained in structures built prior to January 1, 1982, as single-family dwelling units that will remain in residential use, regardless of the number of dwelling units within the existing structure, provided that:

        1. no principal structure is located between the existing single-family dwelling unit and the street lot line along at least one street frontage. If the single-family dwelling unit is moved on the lot, the floor area of the dwelling remains exempt if it continues to meet this provision; and
        2. the exemption is limited to the gross square footage in the single-family dwelling unit as of January 1, 1982.
    4. Portions of a story that extend no more than 4 feet above existing or finished grade, whichever is lower, excluding access, (see Exhibit A for 23.45.510), in the following circumstances:

        1. apartments in LR zones that qualify for the higher FAR limit shown in Table A for 23.45.510;
        2. rowhouse developments in LR zones located on lots that have a lot depth of 100 feet or less, do not have alley access, and that qualify for the higher FAR limit shown in Table A for 23.45.510, provided that parking access is located at the rear of the rowhouse development; and
        3. all multifamily structures in MR and HR zones.
6. If TDP is transferred from a lot pursuant to Section 23.58A.042, the amount of non-exempt floor area that may be permitted is the applicable base FAR, plus any net amount of TDP previously transferred to the lot, minus the sum of the existing non-exempt floor area on the lot and the amount of TDP transferred.

![23-45-516.png](./images/23-45-516.png)


Map A for Neighborhood Green Streets


1. General. Definitions in Section 23.58A.004 apply in this Section 23.45.516 unless otherwise specified. According to the provisions of this Section 23.45.516, Section 23.45.526, and Chapter 23.58A:

    1. In MR, MR/85, and HR zones, extra residential floor area may be permitted up to the maximum limits allowed by Section 23.45.510; and
    2. In MR and HR zones, additional height above the base height limit is permitted for structures that qualify for extra residential floor area, up to the maximum limits allowed by Sections 23.45.514 and 23.45.516.
2. Eligible lots. The following lots are eligible for extra residential floor area and, except in MR/85 zones, additional height:

    1. Lots in MR or MR/85 zones in urban villages, urban centers, and the Station Area Overlay District, except when the lot abuts a lot zoned single-family or is directly across an alley from a lot zoned single-family; and
    2. Lots in HR zones.
3. HR zones

    1. Extra residential floor area. In HR zones extra residential floor area may be gained in accordance with Chapter 23.58A subject to the conditions and limits in this Section 23.45.516. Up to all extra residential floor area may be gained through the affordable housing incentive program provisions in Section 23.58A.014. Up to 40 percent of extra residential floor area may be gained by one or any combination of:

        1. transfer of development potential;
        2. providing neighborhood open space or a payment in lieu thereof; and/or
        3. providing a neighborhood green street setback if allowed pursuant to subsection 23.45.516.F, all in accordance with this Section 23.45.516 and Chapter 23.58A.
    2. Structure height

        1. Structures 240 feet or less in height. The applicable height limit in an HR zone under subsection 23.45.514.B is 240 feet if the applicant satisfies the conditions for extra floor area but not all of the conditions in subsection 23.45.516.C.2.b are met.
        2. Structures over 240 feet. The applicable height limit in an HR zone under subsection 23.45.514.B is 300 feet if the applicant satisfies the conditions for extra floor area and the following additional conditions are met:

            1. For any structure above a height of 85 feet, the average residential gross floor area per story above a height of 45 feet does not exceed 9,500 square feet;
            2. No parking is located at or above grade, unless it is separated from all street lot lines by another use; and
            3. At least 25 percent of the lot area at grade is one or more landscaped open spaces, each with a minimum horizontal dimension of 10 feet, or at least 20 percent of the lot area at grade is landscaped, common amenity area meeting the standards of Section 23.45.522.
4. Transferable Development Potential (TDP) from Landmark structures and open space

    1. Sending lots. TDP may be transferred under the provisions of Section 23.58A.040, as modified by this Section 23.45.516, only from Landmark TDP sites and open space TDP sites. In order to be eligible as a Landmark TDP site or open space TDP site, a lot shall be located in the First Hill Urban Center Village and shall be zoned MR or HR. Sending lots are subject to the limits and conditions in this Chapter 23.45 and Chapter 23.58A. The amount of TDP that may be transferred from a lot is limited to the amount by which the base FAR under Section 23.45.510 exceeds floor area on the lot that is not exempt under Section 23.45.510.
    2. Receiving lots. Any lot located in an HR zone within the First Hill Urban Center Village is eligible for extra residential floor area according to the provisions of this Section 23.45.516 to receive TDP from an eligible sending lot, subject to the limits and conditions in this Chapter 23.45 and Chapter 23.58A.
5. Combined lot development. When authorized by the Director pursuant to this Section 23.45.516, lots located on the same block in an HR zone may be combined, whether contiguous or not, solely for the purpose of allowing some or all of the capacity for chargeable floor area on one or more such lots under this Chapter 23.45 to be used on one or more other lots, according to the provisions of this subsection 23.45.516.E.

    1. Up to all of the capacity on one lot, referred to in this subsection 23.45.516.E as the "base lot," for chargeable floor area in addition to the base FAR, pursuant to Section 23.45.510 (referred to in this subsection 23.45.516.E as "bonus capacity"), may be used on one or more other lots, subject to compliance with all conditions to obtaining extra residential floor area, pursuant to Chapter 23.58A, as modified in this Section 23.45.516. For purposes of applying any conditions related to amenities or features provided on site under this Section 23.45.516, only the lot or lots on which such bonus capacity is used are considered to be the lot or site using a bonus. Criteria for use of extra residential floor area that apply to the structure(s) shall be applied only to the structure(s) on the lots using the transferred bonus capacity. For purposes of the condition to height above 240 feet in subsection 23.45.516.C.2.b.3 of this Section 23.45.516, all lots in a combined lot development are considered as one lot.
    2. Only if all of the bonus capacity on all lots in a combined lot development is used on fewer than all of those lots, there may be transferred from a base lot where no bonus capacity is used, to one or more other lots in the combined lot development, up to all of the unused base FAR on the base lot, without regard to limits on the transfer of TDP or on use of TDP in Chapter 23.58A or subsection 23.45.516.D. Such transfer shall be treated as a transfer of TDP for purposes of determining remaining development capacity on the base lot and TDP available to transfer under Chapter 23.58A, but shall be treated as additional base FAR on the other lots, and, to the extent that, together with other base floor area, it does not exceed the amount of chargeable floor area below the base height limit on the lot where it is used, it shall not be treated as extra residential floor area. If less than all of the bonus capacity of the base lot is used on such other lots, and if the base lot qualifies as a sending lot for TDP, the unused base FAR may be transferred as TDP to the extent permitted by Chapter 23.58A and this Section 23.45.516, but in each case only to satisfy in part the conditions to achieve extra floor area, not as additional base FAR.
    3. To the extent permitted by the Director, the maximum chargeable floor area for any one or more lots in the combined lot development may be increased up to the combined maximum chargeable floor area under Section 23.45.510 computed for all lots participating in the combined lot development, provided that the maximum chargeable floor area on one or more other lots in the combined lot development is correspondingly reduced. To the extent permitted by the Director, and subject to subsection 23.45.516.E.2, the base floor area for any one or more lots in the combined lot development may be increased up to the combined base chargeable floor area under Section 23.45.510 computed for all lots participating in the combined lot development, provided that the base floor area on one or more other lots in the combined lot development is correspondingly reduced.
    4. The Director shall allow a combined lot development only to the extent that the Director determines, in a Type I land use decision, that permitting more chargeable floor area than would otherwise be allowed on a lot or lots and the corresponding reduction on another lot or lots will result in a significant public benefit through one of more of the following:

        1. preservation of a landmark structure located on the block or on an adjacent block either through the inclusion of the lot with the landmark structure as a base lot in the combined lot development or through the transfer of TDP from the lot with the landmark structure to a lot in the combined lot development;
        2. inclusion on the same block of a structure in which low-income housing is provided to satisfy all or part of the conditions to earn extra residential floor area; and/or
        3. provision of open space on the same block to satisfy in part the conditions to achieve extra residential floor area.
    5. The fee owners of each of the combined lots shall execute an appropriate agreement or instrument, which shall include the legal descriptions of each lot and shall be recorded in the King County real property records. In the agreement or instrument, the owners shall acknowledge the extent to which development capacity on each base lot is reduced by the use of such capacity on another lot or lots, at least for so long as the chargeable floor area for which such capacity is used remains on such other lot or lots. The agreement or instrument shall also provide that its covenants and conditions shall run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by the parties and by the City of Seattle.
    6. Nothing in this subsection 23.45.516.E shall allow the development on any lot in a combined lot development to exceed or deviate from height limits or other development standards.
6. Neighborhood green street setback. Floor area may be gained for a neighborhood green street setback according to the provisions of Chapter 23.58A by development on lots abutting one of the streets or street segments within the First Hill Urban Village shown on Map A for 23.45.516.
7. Neighborhood open space. In HR zones, subject to the limits in this Section 23.45.516 and Chapter 23.58A, extra residential floor area may be gained through a voluntary agreement to provide neighborhood open space or a payment in lieu of neighborhood open space, according to the provisions of Section 23.58A.040.

        1. Access from the street is to a common parking garage in or under the structure, that is underground or extends no more than 4 feet above grade.
        2. The siting of development results in an increased Green Factor score, larger ground-level amenity areas, and/or reduced surface parking area than if alley access alone is used.
        3. In LR zones, if the project uses both the alley and street for access to parking other than required barrier-free parking spaces, the project does not qualify for the higher FAR limit in subsection 23.45.510.B.
    5. Access to required barrier-free parking spaces that meet the standards in the Seattle Residential Code, Section R322, or the Seattle Building Code, Chapter 11, may be from either the street or alley, or both.
    6. If the alley is used for access, the alley shall be improved according to the standards in subsections 23.53.030.E and 23.53.030.F, except that if a development gains additional FAR pursuant to subsection 23.45.510.C, the alley shall be paved rather than improved with crushed rock, even for lots containing fewer than ten units.
    7. If the lot does not abut an improved alley or street, access may be permitted from an easement that meets the provisions of Chapter 23.53, Requirements for Streets, Alleys, and Easements.
    8. If street access is required, either:

        1. driveways that provide access from the street to garages opening on a street-facing facade of individual townhouse or rowhouse units shall be paved with permeable materials; or

1. The following uses, where identified as administrative conditional uses on Table A for 23.47A.004, or other uses identified in this Section 23.47A.006, may be permitted by the Director when the provisions of both Section 23.42.042 and this subsection 23.47A.006.A are met:

    1. Drinking establishments. Drinking establishments in NC1 and NC2 zones may be permitted as a conditional use subject to the following:

        1. The size of the drinking establishment, design of the structure, signing and illumination must be compatible with the character of the commercial area and other structures in the vicinity, particularly in areas where a distinct and definite pattern or style has been established.
        2. The location, access and design of parking must be compatible with adjacent residential zones.
        3. Special consideration will be given to the location and design of the doors and windows of drinking establishments to help ensure that noise standards will not be exceeded. The Director may require additional setbacks and/or restrict openings where the drinking establishment is located on a lot that abuts or is across from a residential zone.
        4. Drinking establishments must not generate traffic that creates traffic congestion or further worsens spillover parking on residential streets.
    2. Park and ride lots. Park-and-ride lots in NC3, C1 and C2 zones may be permitted as conditional uses subject to the following:

        1. The park and ride lot shall have direct vehicular access to a designated arterial improved to City standards.
        2. If the proposed park-and-ride lot is located on a lot containing accessory parking for other uses, there must be no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the park-and-ride lot and other uses on the lot.
        3. The Director may require landscaping and screening in addition to that required for surface parking areas, noise mitigation, vehicular access control, signage restrictions, and other measures to provide comfort and safety for pedestrians and bicyclists and to ensure the compatibility of the park and ride lot with the surrounding area.
    3. Residential Uses in C2 zones.

        1. Residential uses may be permitted in C2 zones as a conditional use subject to the following criteria:

            1. The residential use generally should not be located in an area with direct access to major transportation systems such as freeways, state routes and freight rail lines.
            2. The residential use generally should not be located in close proximity to industrial areas and/or nonresidential uses or devices that have the potential to create a nuisance or adversely affect the desirability of the area for living purposes as indicated by one of the following:

                1. The nonresidential use is prohibited in the NC3 zone;
                2. The nonresidential use or device is classified as a major noise generator; or
                3. The nonresidential use is classified as a major odor source.
            3. In making a determination to permit or prohibit residential uses in C2 zones, the Director shall take the following factors into account:

                1. The distance between the lot in question and major transportation systems and potential nuisances;
                2. The presence of physical buffers between the lot in question and major transportation systems and potential nuisance uses;
                3. The potential cumulative impacts of residential uses on the availability for nonresidential uses of land near major transportation systems; and
                4. The number, size and cumulative impacts of potential nuisances on the proposed residential uses.
        2. Residential uses required to obtain a shoreline conditional use permit are not required to obtain an administrative conditional use permit.
        3. Additions to, and accessory structures on the same lot as, existing residential structures are permitted outright.
    4. Medical service uses. Medical service uses over 10,000 square feet, outside but within 2,500 feet of a medical Major Institution overlay district boundary, may be approved as administrative conditional uses, except that they are permitted outright if included in an adopted master plan or dedicated to veterinary services. In order to approve a medical service use under this subsection, the Director must determine that an adequate supply of commercially zoned land for businesses serving neighborhood residents will continue to exist. The following factors will be used in making this determination:

        1. Whether the amount of medical service uses existing and proposed in the vicinity would result in an area containing a concentration of medical services with few other uses; and
        2. Whether medical service uses would displace existing neighborhood-serving commercial uses at street level or disrupt a continuous commercial street front, particularly of general sales and services uses, or significantly detract from an area's overall neighborhood-serving commercial character.
    5. Change of One Nonconforming Use to Another. A nonconforming use may be converted by an administrative conditional use authorization to a use not otherwise permitted in the zone based on the following factors:

        1. New uses are limited to those permitted in the next more intensive zone;
        2. The relative impacts of size, parking, traffic, light, glare, noise, odor and similar impacts of the two uses, and how these impacts could be mitigated; and
        3. The Director must find that the new nonconforming use is no more detrimental to property in the zone and vicinity than the existing nonconforming use.
    6. Lodging uses in NC2 zones are permitted up to 25,000 square feet, when all of the following conditions are met, except that bed and breakfasts in existing structures are permitted outright with no maximum size limit:

        1. The lodging use contains no more than fifty units;

![23-47a-008.png](./images/23-47a-008.png)


Exhibit A forUses and pedestrian access allowed along street-level, street-facing facades


1. For purposes of calculating the 80 percent of a structure's street-level facade, the width of a driveway at street level, not to exceed 22 feet, may be subtracted from the width of the street-facing facade if the access cannot be provided from an alley or from a street that is not a designated principal pedestrian street.
2. If the street-facing facade and depth requirements would result in a requirement that an area greater than 50 percent of the structure's footprint be dedicated to the uses in subsection 23.47A.005.D.1, the Director may modify the street-facing facade or depth requirements, or both, so that no more than 50 percent of the structure's footprint is required to be dedicated to the uses in subsection 23.47A.005.D.1.
3. Overhead weather protection

    1. Continuous overhead weather protection (i.e., canopies, awnings, marquees, and arcades) is required along at least 60 percent of the street frontage of a structure on a principal pedestrian street, except for structures within the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District on lots that contain a character structure as provided in Chapter 23.73.
    2. The covered area shall have a minimum width of 6 feet, unless there is a conflict with existing or proposed street trees or utility poles, in which case the width may be adjusted to accommodate such features as provided in subsection 23.47A.008.C.4.f.
    3. The overhead weather protection must be provided over the sidewalk, or over a walking area within 10 feet immediately adjacent to the sidewalk. When provided adjacent to the sidewalk, the covered walking area must be at the same grade or within 18 inches of sidewalk grade and meet Washington state requirements for barrier-free access.
    4. The lower edge of the overhead weather protection shall be a minimum of 8 feet and a maximum of 12 feet above the sidewalk for projections extending a maximum of 6 feet. For projections extending more than 6 feet from the structure, the lower edge of the weather protection shall be a minimum of 10 feet and a maximum of 15 feet above the sidewalk.
    5. Adequate lighting for pedestrians shall be provided. The lighting may be located on the facade of the building or on the overhead weather protection.
    6. Where the standards listed in this subsection 23.47A.008.C.4 conflict with the vertical and horizontal clearance requirements in the street rights-of-way, the standards may be modified by the Director in consultation with the Director of Transportation.

1. Basic street-level requirements

    1. The provisions of this subsection 23.47A.008.A apply to:

        1. Structures in NC zones;
        2. Structures that contain a residential use in C zones;
        3. Structures in C zones across the street from residential zones; and
        4. All structures in pedestrian-designated zones.
    2. Blank facades

        1. For purposes of this Section 23.47A.008, facade segments are considered blank if they do not include at least one of the following:

            1. Windows;
            2. Entryways or doorways;
            3. Stairs, stoops, or porticos;
            4. Decks or balconies; or
            5. Screening and landscaping on the facade itself.
        2. Blank segments of the street-facing facade between 2 feet and 8 feet above the sidewalk may not exceed 20 feet in width.
        3. The total of all blank facade segments may not exceed 40 percent of the width of the facade of the structure along the street.
    3. Street-level street-facing facades shall be located within 10 feet of the street lot line, unless wider sidewalks, plazas, or other approved landscaped or open spaces are provided.
2. Non-residential street-level requirements

    1. In addition to the provisions of subsection 23.47A.008.A, the provisions of this subsection 23.47A.008.B apply to:

        1. Structures with street-level non-residential uses in NC zones;
        2. Structures with street-level non-residential uses that also contain residential uses in C zones;
        3. Structures with street-level non-residential uses in C zones across the street from residential zones; and
        4. All structures in pedestrian designated zones.
    2. Transparency

        1. Sixty percent of the street-facing facade between 2 feet and 8 feet above the sidewalk shall be transparent. For purposes of calculating the 60 percent of a structure's street-facing facade, the width of a driveway at street level, not to exceed 22 feet, may be subtracted from the width of the street-facing facade if the access cannot be provided from an alley or from a street that is not a designated principal pedestrian street.
        2. Transparent areas of facades shall be designed and maintained to provide views into and out of the structure. Except for institutional uses, no permanent signage, window tinting or treatments, shelving, other furnishings, fixtures, equipment, or stored items shall completely block views into and out of the structure between 4 feet and 7 feet above adjacent grade. The installation of temporary signs or displays that completely block views may be allowed if such temporary sign complies with subsection 23.55.012.B.
    3. Depth provisions for new structures or new additions to existing structures. Non-residential uses shall extend an average depth of at least 30 feet and a minimum depth of 15 feet from the street-level street-facing facade. If the combination of the requirements of Sections 23.47A.005 or 23.47A.008 and this depth requirement would result in a requirement that an area greater than 50 percent of the structure's footprint be dedicated to non-residential use, the Director may modify the street-facing facade or depth requirements, or both, so that no more than 50 percent of the structure's footprint is required to be non-residential.
    4. Height provisions for new structures or new additions to existing structures. Non-residential uses at street level shall have a floor-to-floor height of at least 13 feet.
3. In addition to the provisions of subsections 23.47A.008.A and 23.47A.008.B, the following standards also apply in pedestrian designated zones:

    1. A minimum of 80 percent of the width of a structure's street-level street-facing facade that faces a principal pedestrian street shall be occupied by uses listed in subsection 23.47A.005.D.1. The remaining 20 percent of the street frontage may contain other permitted uses and/or pedestrian entrances (see Exhibit A for 23.47A.008).
4. Where residential uses are located along a street-level street-facing facade the following requirements apply unless exempted by subsection 23.47A.008.G:

    1. At least one of the street-level street-facing facades containing a residential use shall have a visually prominent pedestrian entry; and
    2. The floor of a dwelling unit located along the street-level street-facing facade shall be at least 4 feet above or 4 feet below sidewalk grade or be set back at least 10 feet from the sidewalk.
5. When a live-work unit is located on a street-level street-facing facade, the provisions of subsections 23.47A.008.A and 23.47A.008.B, and the following requirements, apply:

    1. The portion of each such live-work unit in which business is conducted must be located between the principal street and the residential portion of the live-work unit. The non-residential portions of the unit shall extend the width of the street-level street-facing facade, shall extend a minimum depth of 15 feet from the street-level street-facing facade, and shall not contain any of the primary features of the residential (live) portion of the live-work unit, such as kitchen, bathroom, sleeping, or laundry facilities. These basic residential features shall be designed and arranged to be separate from the work portion of the live-work unit.
    2. Each live-work unit must include an exterior sign with the name of the business associated with the live-work unit. Such signage shall be clearly associated with the unit and visible to pedestrians outside of the building.
    3. The owner of each live-work unit must keep a copy of the current business license associated with the business located in that unit on file.
6. The Director may allow exceptions to the street-level requirements of this Section 23.47A.008, as a Type I decision, for projects that are not subject to the Design Review process, except that in a pedestrian-designated zone exceptions may not be granted for requirements for residential uses at street level, transparency requirements, or floor-to-floor height requirements as described in subsection 23.41.012.B. Exceptions may be granted if the Director determines that the project will maintain the safety and aesthetics of the streetscape for pedestrians and will:

    1. maintain pedestrian access to the structure;
    2. maintain urban form consistent with adjacent structures and previous design review decisions on the site;
    3. maintain the visibility of non-residential uses;
    4. maintain the privacy of residential uses; or
    5. allow the continued use of an existing structure without substantial renovation.
7. In a structure existing on January 1, 2012, an accessory dwelling unit may be established if it is accessory to an existing dwelling unit and if it meets minimum housing standards of Chapter 22.206, even if nonconforming to standards of subsection 23.47A.008.D.

    3. when it would not otherwise be feasible to provide the required number of spaces; or
    4. when required parking can only be provided at the rear lot line and access to individual parking spaces can only be provided directly from the alley.
2. In deciding whether and to what extent to waive or reduce the landscaping and screening requirements, the Director shall consider whether:

    1. the lot width and depth permit alternative workable site plans that would allow screening and landscaping;
    2. the character of uses across the alley, such as a parking garage accessory to a multifamily structure, makes the screening and landscaping less necessary;
    3. the lot is in a location where access to parking from the street is not permitted; and
    4. a topographic break between the alley and the residential zone makes screening less necessary.
3. Fences or free-standing walls associated with utility services uses may obstruct or allow views to the interior of a site. Where site dimensions and site conditions allow, applicants are encouraged to provide both a landscaped setback between the fence or wall and the right-of-way, and a fence or wall that provides visual interest facing the street lot line, through the height, design or construction of the fence or wall, including the use of materials, architectural detailing, artwork, vegetated trellises, decorative fencing, or similar features. Any fence or free-standing wall for a utility services use must provide either:

    1. A 5-foot-deep landscaped area between the wall or fence and the street lot line; or
    2. Architectural detailing, artwork, vegetated trellises, decorative fencing, or similar features to provide visual interest facing the street lot line, as approved by the Director.
4. Other uses or circumstances. Screening and landscaping is required according to Table D for 23.47A.016:

1. Failure to comply with the applicant's commitment to earn a LEED rating is a violation of the Land Use Code independent of the failure to demonstrate compliance; however, such violation shall not affect the right to occupy any chargeable floor area, and if a penalty is paid in the amount determined under subsection 23.48.021.D.2.c.3, no additional penalty shall be imposed for the failure to comply with the commitment.
2. If the Director determines that the report submitted provides satisfactory evidence that the applicant's commitment is satisfied, the Director shall issue a certificate to the applicant so stating. If the Director determines that the applicant did not demonstrate compliance with its commitment to earn a LEED rating in accordance with this subsection 23.48.021.D, the Director may give notice of such determination, and of the calculation of the penalty due, to the applicant.
3. If, within 90 days, or such longer period as the Director may allow for good cause, after initial notice from the Director of a penalty due under this subsection 23.48.021.D.2, the applicant shall demonstrate, through a supplemental report from the independent entity that provided the initial report, that it has made sufficient alterations or improvements to earn a LEED rating, or to earn more credits toward such a rating, then the penalty owing shall be eliminated or recalculated accordingly. The amount of the penalty as so re-determined shall be final. If the applicant does not submit a supplemental report in accordance with this subsection 23.48.021.D.2 by the date required under this subsection 23.48.021.D.2, then the amount of the penalty as set forth in the Director's original notice shall be final.
4. Any owner, other than the applicant, of any lot on which the bonus development was obtained or any part thereof, shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance and liable for any penalty due under this subsection 23.48.021.D.2.
5. Use of penalties. A subfund shall be established in the City's General Fund to receive revenue from penalties under subsection 23.48.021.D.2. Revenue from penalties under that subsection 23.48.021.D.2 shall be allocated to activities or incentives to encourage and promote the development of sustainable buildings. The Director shall recommend to the Mayor and City Council how these funds should be allocated.
6. Transportation Management Program (TMP). The applicant will provide a TMP for non-residential development, consistent with requirements for TMPs in any applicable Director's Rule, that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director in consultation with the Director of Transportation, that no more than 40 percent of trips to and from the development will be made using single-occupant vehicles (SOVs). The TMP shall be submitted with the Master Use Permit application.

    1. For purposes of measuring the percent of trips to and from the development made using SOVs in the TMP, the number of SOV trips shall be calculated for the p.m. peak hour in which an applicant expects the largest number of vehicle trips to be made by employees at the site (the p.m. peak hour of the generator).
    2. Compliance with this subsection 23.48.021.D.3 does not affect the responsibility of any employer to comply with Seattle's Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) Ordinance.

For the podiums of structures with residential uses that exceed the base height limit established for the zone under subsection 23.48.225.A.1 and for structures with non-residential uses that exceed a height of 85 feet, the average floor area coverage of required lot area, pursuant to subsection 23.48.245.A, for all the stories below the podium height specified on Map A for 23.48.245, shall not exceed 75 percent of the lot area, except that floor area is not limited for each story if the total number of stories below the podium height is three or fewer stories, or if the conditions in subsection 23.48.245.B.4.c apply.
        3. The floor area limit on podiums in subsection 23.48.245.B.4.b does not apply if a lot includes one of the following:

            1. Usable open space that meets the provisions of subsection 23.48.240.F; or
            2. A structure that has been in existence prior to 1965 and the following conditions are met;

                1. The structure is rehabilitated and maintained to comply with applicable codes and shall have a minimum useful life of at least 50 years from the time that it was included on the lot with the project allowed to waive the podium area limit;
                2. The owner agrees that the structure shall not be significantly altered for at least 50 years from the time that it was included on the lot with the project allowed to waive the podium area limit. Significant alteration means the following:

                    1. Alteration of the exterior facades of the structure, except alterations that restore the facades to their original condition;
                    2. Alteration of the floor-to-ceiling height of the street-level story, except alterations that restore the floor-to-ceiling height to its original condition; or
                    3. The addition of stories to the structure, unless the proposed addition is no taller than the maximum height to which the structure was originally built, or the addition is approved through the design review process as compatible with the original character of the structure and is necessary for adapting the structure to new uses; or
                3. If the structure is removed from the lot, then any use of the portion of the lot previously occupied by the structure shall be limited to usable open space. The portion of the lot previously occupied by the structure shall be defined by a rectangle enclosing the exterior walls of the structure as they existed at the time it was included on the lot with the project allowed to waive the podium area limit, with the rectangle extended to the nearest street frontage.
        4. Additional height for podiums abutting Class 1 Pedestrian Streets. Podium height for structures fronting on Class 1 Pedestrian Streets pursuant to Section 23.48.240 may exceed podium height limits shown on Map A for 23.48.245 by 5 feet provided that floor-to-ceiling clearance at the ground floor is at least 15 feet.

4. Limit on tower structures per block

    1. Only one residential tower, or one structure with non-residential uses exceeding 85 feet in height, is permitted on a single block front, except as further limited by subsections 23.48.245.F.3, 23.48.245.F.4, and 23.48.245.F.5.
    2. For purposes of this subsection 23.48.245.F an existing tower is either:

        1. A tower that is physically present, except as provided below in subsection 23.48.245.F.2.b; or
        2. A proposed tower for which a Master Use Permit decision has been issued, unless and until either:

            1. the Master Use Permit issued pursuant to such a decision expires or is cancelled, or the related application is withdrawn by the applicant, without the tower having been constructed; or
            2. a ruling by a hearing examiner or court reversing or vacating such a decision, or determining such decision or the Master Use Permit issued thereunder to be invalid, becomes final and no longer subject to judicial review.
    3. In the SM-SLU 85/65-160 zone, only one residential tower structure or one non-residential tower structure with a hotel use meeting residential development standards is permitted per block.
    4. In the SM-SLU 85/65-125 zone, more than one residential tower is permitted on a block front provided that the minimum lot area for a tower is 30,000 square feet.
    5. Only one structure with non-residential uses exceeding 85 feet in height is permitted on a block, unless the structure meets the requirements of Section 23.48.230 or unless all of the following conditions apply:

        1. The structure is on a lot with a minimum area of 60,000 square feet. The area of one or more lots, separated only by an alley, may be combined for the purposes of calculating the minimum required lot area under this subsection 23.48.245.F.5. The minimum lot area is 59,000 square feet if the lot area was reduced below 60,000 square feet as a result of acquisition of right-of-way by the City;
        2. A minimum separation of 60 feet is provided between all portions of structures on the lot that exceed the limit on podium height shown on Map A for 23.48.245. If the lot includes a qualifying Landmark structure, an average separation of 60 feet is permitted.

        4. A pedestrian connection meeting the development standards of subsection 23.48.240.F for through-block pedestrian connections for large lot developments is provided though the lot to connect the north/south avenues abutting the lot. If the lot abuts an avenue that has been vacated, the connection shall be to an easement providing public access along the original alignment of the avenue. In addition, if the slope of the lot between the north/south avenues exceeds a slope of 10 percent, a hill-climb shall be provided.
        5. The application of the provisions in this subsection 23.48.245.F.5 shall not result in more than two structures on a block with either non-residential uses above 85 feet in height or with residential use above the base height limit for residential use, except as allowed by subsection 23.48.245.F.5.f.
        6. For lots that, as a result of a street vacation, exceed 150,000 square feet, the Director shall, as a Type I decision, determine the permitted number of structures with non-residential uses above 85 feet in height or with residential use above the base height limit, based on the limits in subsection 23.48.245.F.5.e as applied to the block conditions existing prior to the street vacation.
        7. The Director shall make a determination of project impacts on the need for pedestrian and bike facilities and complete a voluntary agreement between the property owner and the City to mitigate impacts, if any. The Director may consider the following as impact mitigation:

            1. Pedestrian walkways on a lot, including through-block connections on through lots, where appropriate, to facilitate pedestrian circulation by connecting structures to each other and abutting streets;
            2. Sidewalk improvements, including sidewalk widening, to accommodate increased pedestrian volumes and streetscape improvements that will enhance pedestrian comfort and safety;
            3. Improvements to enhance the pedestrian environment, such as providing overhead weather protection, landscaping, and other streetscape improvements; and
            4. Bike share stations.
        8. For development that exceeds 85,000 or more square feet of gross office floor area, the Director shall make a determination as to the project's impact on the need for open space. The Director may limit floor area or allow floor area subject to conditions, which may include a voluntary agreement between the property owner and the City to mitigate impacts, if any. The Director shall take into account subsection 23.48.250 in assessing the demand for open space generated by an office development in an area permitting high employment densities.

            1. The Director may consider the following as mitigation for open space impacts:

                1. Open space provided on-site or off-site, consistent with the provisions in subsection 23.49.016.C, or provided through payment in lieu, consistent with subsection 23.49.016.D, except that in all cases the open space shall be located on a lot in an SM zone that is accessible to the development's occupants;
                2. Additional pedestrian amenities through on-site or streetscape improvements provided as mitigation for impacts on pedestrian facilities pursuant to subsection 23.48.245.F.5.g; and
                3. Public space inside or on the roof of a Landmark building.
            2. The Director may approve open space in lieu of that contained or referred to in subsection 23.49.016.C to mitigate project impacts, based on consideration of relevant factors, including the following:

                1. the density or other characteristics of the workers anticipated to occupy the development compared to the presumed office employment population providing the basis for the open space standards applicable under Section 23.49.016; and
                2. characteristics or features of the development that mitigate the anticipated open space impacts of workers or others using or occupying the project.
5. Tower separation. The following separation is required between structures with residential use above the base height limit for residential use and that are located on the same block. For the purposes of this subsection 23.48.245.G, a block is defined as the area bounded by street lot lines and excluding alley lot lines. Alleys shall not be deemed to bisect a block into two separate blocks:

    1. A separation of 60 feet is required between all portions of residential structures above the podium height limit for residential structures that exceed the base height limit for residential use, except as provided by subsection 23.48.245.F.2.
    2. No separation is required on blocks within the area bounded by Aurora Avenue North, John Street, Thomas Street, and 9 Avenue North.
    3. The first 4 feet of the horizontal projection of unenclosed decks and balconies, and architectural features such as cornices shall be disregarded in calculating tower separation.

##### 23.48.250 - Open space requirement for office uses in South Lake Union Urban Center

1. Finding. The City Council finds that:

    1. With the increase in office development and the Comprehensive Plan's significant employment growth targets for the South Lake Union Urban Center, office workers will increasingly become major users of open space in the area.
    2. Additional major office projects in South Lake Union Urban Center will result in increased use of public open space. If additional major office projects in South Lake Union Urban Center do not provide open space to offset the additional demands on public open space caused by such projects, the result will be overcrowding of public open space, adversely affecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
    3. Recent and projected office development in the South Lake Union Urban Center is generally comparable to office development in the abutting Downtown Urban Center in terms of tenant characteristics, density, and open space need. Therefore, the findings that support the current open space requirement in major downtown office projects are applicable to conditions in South Lake Union Urban Center.
    4. The additional open space needed to accommodate office workers is at least 20 square feet for each 1,000 square feet of office space.
    5. As in Downtown, smaller office developments in South Lake Union Urban Center may encounter design problems in incorporating open space, and the sizes of open spaces provided for office projects under 85,000 square feet may make them less attractive and less likely to be used. Therefore, and in order not to discourage small scale office development, projects involving less than 85,000 square feet of new office space should be exempt from any open space requirement.
2. Quantity of open space. Open space in the amount of 20 square feet for each 1,000 square feet of gross office floor area is required for the following projects:

    1. The project is on a lot located in an SM-SLU zone that has a height limit for non-residential uses that exceeds 85 feet; and
    2. The project includes 85,000 or more square feet of gross office floor area.
3. Standards for open space. Open space may be provided on-site or off-site, as follows:

    1. On-site open space

        1. Open space on site or on an adjacent lot directly accessible from the project site shall satisfy the requirement of this Section 23.48.250 if it meets the standards of subsection 23.48.240.F or subsection 23.48.240.G and the open space is accessible to all occupants of the building.
        2. Open space provided on-site under this requirement is eligible for amenity feature bonuses, where allowed in Section 23.48.021 or 23.48.221 when the following standards are met:

            1. The space has a minimum horizontal dimension of 20 feet and a minimum floor-to-ceiling height of 13 feet;
            2. The space is directly accessible to pedestrians, including persons with disabilities, from the street, or from an outdoor usable open space abutting the street;
            3. The space is available for use during normal business hours;
            4. Enclosed areas providing the connection between the structure's primary pedestrian access to the street and elevator cores, such as lobby space, do not qualify as required open space.
    2. Off-site public open space

        1. Open space satisfying the requirement of this Section 23.48.250 may be on a site other than the project site, provided that it is within an SM-SLU zone and within one-quarter mile of the project site, open to the public without charge, and at least 3,000 square feet in contiguous area. The minimum size of off-site open space and maximum distance from the project may be increased or decreased for a project if the Director determines that such adjustments are reasonably necessary to provide for open space that will meet the additional need for open space caused by the project and enhance public access.
        2. Open space that is open to the public and provided on a site other than the project site may qualify for a development bonus for the project if the open space meets the standards of Section 23.49.013.
    3. Easement for off-site open space. The owner of any lot on which off-site open space is provided to meet the requirements of this Section 23.48.250 shall execute and record an easement in a form acceptable to the Director assuring compliance with the requirements of this Section 23.48.250. The Director is authorized to accept such an easement, provided that the terms do not impose any costs or obligations on the City.
    4. Open space provided under this Section 23.48.250 shall qualify as the open space required under subsections 23.48.240.F and 23.48.240.G, and this Section 23.48.250 if within one-quarter mile of the sending site.
4. Payment in lieu. In lieu of providing open space required under this Section 23.48.250, an owner may make a payment to the City if the Director determines that the payment will contribute to the improvement of a designated Neighborhood Green Street or to other public open space improvements abutting the lot or in the vicinity, in an amount sufficient to develop improvements that will meet the additional need for open space caused by the project, and that completion of the improvement within a reasonable time is feasible. Any such payment shall be placed in a dedicated fund or account and used within five years of receipt for the development of such improvements, unless the property owner and the City agree upon a different improvement involving the acquisition or development of public open space that will mitigate the impact of the project. A bonus may be allowed for a payment in lieu of providing the improvement made wholly or in part to satisfy the requirements of this Section 23.48.250, pursuant to Section 23.49.013.
5. Limitations. Open space satisfying the requirement of this Section 23.48.250 for any project shall not be used to satisfy the open space requirement for any other project, nor shall any bonus be granted to any project for open space meeting the requirement of this Section 23.48.250 for any other project. When a transmitting antenna is sited or proposed to be sited on a rooftop where required open space is located, see Section 23.57.013. Open space on the site of any building for which a Master Use Permit decision was issued or a complete building permit application was filed prior to the effective date of this ordinance, that was not required under the Land Use Code in effect when such permit decision was issued or such application filed, but that would have been required for the same building by this Section 23.48.250, shall not be used to satisfy the open space requirement or to gain an FAR bonus for any other project.

##### 23.48.255 - Screening and landscaping standards in South Lake Union Urban Center

1. Landscaping requirements

    1. Landscaping required by this Section 23.48.255 to achieve the Green Factor score of .30 may be met on one or more other lots within the SM-SLU 85/65-160 zone, on the blocks bounded by Valley Street, Mercer Street, Westlake Avenue North, and Fairview Avenue North, or their adjacent rights-of-way when a Green Factor score of .50 or greater is achieved and when, prior to issuance of a Master Use Permit for any development that relies on one or more other lots within the SM-SLU 85/65-160 zone, on the blocks bounded by Valley Street, Mercer Street, Westlake Avenue North, and Fairview Avenue North, or their adjacent rights-of-way to meet the landscaping requirement of this Section 23.48.255, the fee owner of the lot(s) used to meet landscaping requirements shall execute a restrictive covenant that is recorded in the King County real property records that:

        1. restricts the use of that portion of the off-site property that is to meet the landscaping requirement of this Section 23.48.255;
        2. includes the legal descriptions of the lot burdened by the covenant;
        3. acknowledges the specific extent to which the Green Factor standards are met through a combination of the lots; and
        4. provides that the covenant shall be in effect until the Master Use Permit terminates or the development allowed by the Master Use Permit no longer requires the off-site landscaping.
2. Parking in structures. Except as provided for by subsection 23.48.085.B, parking located at or above street level in a garage shall be screened on Class 1 and 2 Pedestrian Streets, shown on Map A for 23.48.240, parking is not permitted at street level unless separated from the street by other uses, provided that garage doors need not be separated.

##### 23.48.280 - Required parking in South Lake Union Urban Center

1. Off-street parking spaces and bicycle parking are required according to Section 23.54.015, Required parking.
2. Maximum parking limit for non-residential uses

    1. Except as provided in subsections 23.48.280.B.2 and 23.48.280.B.3, parking for non-residential uses is limited to one parking space per every 1,000 square feet of gross floor area in non-residential use.
    2. If, on or before September 1, 2012, a lot is providing legal off-site parking for another lot, by means such as a recorded parking easement or off-site accessory parking covenant on the subject lot, then the number of such off-site parking spaces is allowed on the off-site lot in addition to one space per 1,000 square feet for non-residential uses on the subject lot.
    3. A lot in the SM-SLU 85/65-160 zone may exceed the maximum parking limit in subsection 23.48.280.B without approval of a special exception pursuant to subsection 23.48.280.B.2 when, prior to issuance of a Master Use Permit for the lot that exceeds the maximum parking limit, the fee owners of both the property subject to the Master Use Permit for the lot that exceeds the maximum parking limit and the fee owners of the property subject to the Master Use Permit execute a restrictive covenant that is recorded in the King County real property records that limits the amount of parking that can be provided on other lot(s), such that the total quantity of parking provided as part of the Master Use Permit together with the parking to be provided on the other lot(s) subject to the restrictive covenant does not exceed the maximum parking limit in subsection 23.48.280.B.
3. Parking at street level within structures. Parking is permitted in a story that is partially above street level and partially below street level in a structure permitted in a setback area under the provisions of subsection 23.48.240.C.2.b.

##### 23.48.285 - Parking location, access and curb cuts in South Lake Union Urban Center

1. Parking location within structures

    1. Parking above the street level of a structure. The following provisions apply to development in the SM-SLU 85/65-125, SM-SLU 85/65-160, SM-SLU 160/85-240, SM-SLU 85-240, and SM-SLU 240/125-400 zones within the South Lake Union Urban Center:

        1. Except as provided in subsection 23.48.285.B for parking partially above street level and partially below street level, parking within structures is permitted above the street level under the following conditions:

            1. One story of parking is permitted above the first story of a structure for each story of parking provided below grade that is of at least equivalent capacity, up to a maximum of two stories of parking above the first story.
            2. For parking located on a story above the first story of a structure, a minimum of 30 percent of the length of the parking area measured along each street frontage shall be separated from the street by another use. On lots located at street intersections, the separation of parking area by another use shall be provided at the corner portion(s) of the structure.
            3. The parking area on a story above the first story of the structure that is not separated from the street by another use shall be enclosed by facades along all street frontages. Facades shall be designed to minimize the impacts of glare from vehicle headlights and interior garage lighting on pedestrian views from the street.
        2. The Director may permit more than two stories of parking above the first story of the structure, or may permit other exceptions to subsection 23.48.285.A.1, as a Type I decision, if the Director finds that locating parking below grade is infeasible due to physical site conditions such as a high water table or proximity to a tunnel. In such cases, the Director shall determine the maximum feasible amount of parking that can be provided below grade, if any, and the amount of additional parking to be permitted above street level. Site size is not a basis for granting an exception under this subsection 23.48.285.A.1.b.
2. In the SM-SLU 85/65-125, SM-SLU 85/65-160, SM-SLU 160/85-240, SM-SLU 85-240, and SM-SLU 240/125-400 zones in the South Lake Union Urban Center, accessory surface parking is prohibited unless separated from all street lot lines by another use within a structure.

##### 23.49.006 - Scope of general standards.

Unless otherwise specified, the regulations of this subchapter shall apply to all downtown zones.


##### 23.49.008 - Structure height

The following provisions regulating structure height apply to all property in Downtown zones except the DH1 zone. Structure height for PSM, IDM and IDR zones is regulated by this Section 23.49.008, and by Sections 23.49.178, 23.49.208, and 23.49.236.

In certain zones, as specified in this Section 23.49.008, the maximum structure height may be allowed only for particular uses or only on specified conditions, or both. If height limits are specified for portions of a structure that contain specified types of uses, the applicable height limit for the structure is the highest applicable height limit for the types of uses in the structure, unless otherwise specified.


1. Except in the PMM zone, the base height limit for a structure is the lowest of the maximum structure height or the lowest other height limit, if any, that applies pursuant to this Title 23 based upon the uses in the structure, before giving effect to any bonus for which the structure qualifies under this Chapter 23.49 and to any special exceptions or departures authorized under this Chapter 23.49. In the PMM zone the base height limit is the maximum height permitted pursuant to urban renewal covenants.
2. In zones listed below in this subsection 23.49.008.A.3, the applicable height limit for portions of a structure that contain non-residential and live-work uses is shown as the first figure after the zone designation (except that there is no such limit in DOC1), and the base height limit for portions of a structure in residential use is shown as the first figure following the "/". The third figure shown is the maximum residential height limit. Except as stated in subsection 23.49.008.D, the base residential height limit is the applicable height limit for portions of a structure in use if the structure does not use the bonus available under Section 23.49.015, and the maximum residential height limit is the height limit for portions of a structure in residential use if the structure uses the bonus available under Section 23.49.015:

DOC1 Unlimited/450 unlimited

DOC2 500/300-500

DMC 340/290-400

DMC 240/290-400.

3. A structure in a DMC 340/290-400 zone on a lot comprising a full block that abuts a DOC1 zone along at least one street frontage may gain additional structure height of 30 percent above the maximum residential height limit if the structure uses the bonus available under Section 23.49.015, or 35 percent above 340 feet if that bonus is not used, in either case under the following conditions:

    1. Only one tower is permitted on the lot;
    2. Any additional floor area above the maximum height limit for non-residential or live-work use, as increased under this subsection 23.49.008.A.4, is occupied by residential use;
    3. The average residential gross floor area and maximum residential floor area of any story in the portion of the tower permitted above the base residential height limit do not exceed the limits prescribed in subsection 23.49.058.E.1;
    4. Any residential floor area allowed above the base residential height limit under this provision is gained through voluntary agreements to provide low-income or moderate-income housing according to Section 23.49.015;
    5. At least 35 percent of the lot area, or a minimum of 25,000 square feet, whichever is greater, is in open space use substantially at street level meeting the following standards, and subject to the following allowances for coverage:

        1. The location and configuration of the space shall enhance solar exposure, allow easy access to entrances to the tower serving all tenants and occupants from streets abutting the open space, and allow convenient pedestrian circulation through all portions of the open space. The open space shall be entirely contiguous and physically accessible. To offset the impact of the taller structure allowed, the open space shall have frontage at grade abutting sidewalks, and be visible from sidewalks, on at least two streets. The elevation of the space may vary, especially on sloping lots where terracing the space facilitates connections to abutting streets, provided that grade changes are gradual and do not significantly disrupt the continuity of the space, and no part of the open space is significantly above the grade of the nearest abutting street. The Director may allow greater grade changes, as necessary, to facilitate access to transit tunnel stations.
        2. Up to 20 percent of the area used to satisfy the open space condition to allowing additional height may be covered by the following features: permanent, freestanding structures, such as retail kiosks, pavilions, or pedestrian shelters; structural overhangs; overhead arcades or other forms of overhead weather protection; and any other features approved by the Director that contribute to pedestrian comfort and active use of the space. The following features within the open space area may count as open space and are not subject to the percentage coverage limit: temporary kiosks and pavilions, public art, permanent seating that is not reserved for any commercial use, exterior stairs and mechanical assists that provide access to public areas and are available for public use, and any similar features approved by the Director.
    6. Open space used to satisfy the condition to allowing additional height in this Section 23.49.008 is not eligible for a bonus under Section 23.49.013.
    7. Open space used to satisfy the condition to allowing additional height in this Section 23.49.008 may qualify as common recreation area to the extent permitted by subsection 23.49.011.B and may be used to satisfy open space requirements in subsection 23.49.016.C.1 if it satisfies the standards of that subsection 23.49.016.C.1.
    8. No increase in height shall be granted to any proposed development that would result in significant alteration to any designated feature of a landmark structure, unless a certificate of approval for the alteration is granted by the Landmarks Preservation Board.
4. In a DRC zone, the base height limit is 85 feet, except that, subject to the conditions in subsection 23.49.008.A.6:

    1. The base height limit is 150 feet if any of the following conditions is satisfied:

        1. all portions of a structure above 85 feet contain only residential use; or
        2. at least 25 percent of the gross floor area of all structures on a lot is in residential use; or
        3. a minimum of 1.5 FAR of retail sales and service or entertainment uses, or any combination thereof, is provided on the lot.
    2. For residential floor area created by infill of a light well on a Landmark structure, the base height limit is the lesser of 150 feet or the highest level at which the light well is enclosed by the full length of walls of the structure on at least three sides. For the purpose of this subsection 23.49.008.A.5.b a light well is defined as an inward modulation on a non-street facing facade that is enclosed on at least three sides by walls of the same structure, and infill is defined as an addition to that structure within the light well.
5. Restrictions on demolition and alteration of existing structures

    1. Any structure in a DRC zone that would exceed the 85 foot base height limit shall incorporate the existing exterior street front facade(s) of each of the structures listed below, if any, located on the lot of that project. The City Council finds that these structures are significant to the architecture, history and character of downtown. The Director may permit changes to the exterior facade(s) to the extent that significant features are preserved and the visual integrity of the design is maintained. The degree of exterior preservation required will vary, depending upon the nature of the project and the characteristics of the affected structure(s).
    2. The Director shall evaluate whether the manner in which the facade is proposed to be preserved meets the intent to preserve the architecture, character and history of the Retail Core. If a structure on the lot is a Landmark structure, approval by the Landmarks Preservation Board for any proposed modifications to controlled features is required prior to a decision by the Director to allow or condition additional height for the project. The Landmarks Preservation Board's decision shall be incorporated into the Director's decision. Inclusion of a structure on the list below is solely for the purpose of conditioning additional height under this subsection 23.49.008A.6.b, and shall not be interpreted in any way to prejudge the structure's merit as a Landmark:
    3. The restrictions in this subsection 23.49.008.A.6 are in addition to, and not in substitution for, the requirements of the Landmarks Ordinance, Chapter 25.12.
6. The applicable height limit for a structure is the base height limit plus any height allowed as a bonus under this Chapter 23.49 and any additional height allowed by special exception or departure, or by subsection 23.49.008.A.4. The height of a structure shall not exceed the applicable height limit, except as provided in subsections 23.49.008.B, 23.49.008.C, and 23.49.008.D.

##### 23.49.011 - Floor area ratio

1. General standards

    1. The base and maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for each zone is provided in Table A for 23.49.011.
    2. Chargeable floor area shall not exceed the applicable base FAR except as expressly authorized pursuant to this Chapter 23.49.

        1. In DOC1, DOC2, and DMC zones that are located outside of South Downtown, if chargeable floor area above the base FAR is allowed on a lot for development that includes a new structure and the project is located within the Local Infrastructure Project Area for Downtown and South Lake Union as shown on Map A for 23.58A.044, the first increment of chargeable floor area above the base FAR, shown for each zone in Table B for 23.49.011, shall be gained by acquiring regional development credits pursuant to Section 23.58A.044.
        2. In DOC1, DOC2, DH2, and DMC zones outside of South Downtown, additional chargeable floor area above the first increment of FAR that exceeds the base FAR may be obtained only by qualifying for floor area bonuses pursuant to Section 23.49.012 or 23.49.013, or by the transfer of transferable development rights pursuant to Section 23.49.014, or both, except as otherwise expressly provided in this subsection 23.49.011.A.2. If the requirements of subsection 23.49.011.A.2.a do not apply, the first increment of floor area that exceeds the base FAR shall be zero.
        3. In no event shall the use of bonuses, TDR, or regional development credits, or any combination of them, be allowed to result in chargeable floor area in excess of the maximum as set forth in Table A for 23.49.011, except that a structure on a lot in a planned community development pursuant to Section 23.49.036 or a combined lot development pursuant to Section 23.49.041 may exceed the floor area ratio otherwise permitted on that lot, provided the chargeable floor area on all lots included in the planned community development or combined lot development as a whole does not exceed the combined total permitted chargeable floor area.
        4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection 23.49.011.A.2.d or subsections 23.49.011.A.2.f or 23.49.011.A.2.h, and except in South Downtown, not less than 5 percent of all floor area above the base FAR to be gained on any lot, excluding any floor area gained under subsections 23.49.011.A.2.a, 23.49.011.A.2.j, and 23.49.011.A.2.k, shall be gained through the transfer of Landmark TDR, to the extent that Landmark TDR are available. Landmark TDR shall be considered "available" only to the extent that, at the time of the Master Use Permit application to gain the additional floor area, the City of Seattle is offering Landmark TDR for sale, at a price per square foot no greater than the total bonus contribution under Section 23.49.012 for a project using the cash option for both housing and childcare facilities. An applicant may satisfy the minimum Landmark TDR requirement in this Section 23.49.011 by purchases from private parties, by transfer from an eligible sending lot owned by the applicant, by purchase from the City, or by any combination of the foregoing. This subsection 23.49.011.A.2.d does not apply to any lot in a DMR zone.
        5. Except as otherwise permitted under subsections 23.49.011.A.2.g, 23.49.011.A.2.h, or 23.49.011.A.2.l, on any lot outside of South Downtown except a lot in a DMR zone, the total amount of chargeable floor area gained through bonuses under Section 23.49.012, together with any housing TDR and Landmark housing TDR used for the same project, shall equal 75 percent of the amount, if any, by which the total chargeable floor area to be permitted on the lot exceeds the sum of

            1. the base FAR, as determined under this Section 23.49.011 and Section 23.49.032 if applicable, plus
            2. any chargeable floor area gained on the lot pursuant to subsections 23.49.011.A.2.a, 23.49.011.A.2.g, 23.49.011.A.2.h, 23.49.011.A.2.j, and 23.49.011.A.2.k. Except in South Downtown, at least half of the remaining 25 percent shall be gained by using TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility, to the extent available, and the balance of the 25 percent shall be gained through bonuses under Section 23.49.013 or through TDR other than housing TDR, or both, consistent with this Chapter 23.49. TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility shall be considered "available" only to the extent that, at the time of the Master Use Permit application to gain the additional floor area, the City of Seattle is offering such TDR for sale, at a price per square foot not exceeding the prevailing market price for TDR other than housing TDR, as determined by the Director.
        6. In order to gain chargeable floor area on any lot in a DMR zone outside of South Downtown, an applicant may

            1. use any types of TDR eligible under this Chapter 23.49 in any proportions, or
            2. use bonuses under Section 23.49.012 or 23.49.013, or both, subject to the limits for particular types of bonus under Section 23.49.013, or
            3. combine such TDR and bonuses in any proportions.
        7. On any lot in a DMC zone allowing a maximum FAR of 7, in addition to the provisions of subsection 23.49.011.A.2.e, an applicant may gain chargeable floor area above the first increment of FAR above the base FAR through use of DMC housing TDR, or any combination of DMC housing TDR with floor area gained through other TDR and bonuses as prescribed in subsection 23.49.011.A.2.e.
        8. If the amount of bonus development sought in any permit application does not exceed 5,000 square feet of chargeable floor area, the Director may permit such floor area to be achieved solely through the bonus for housing and child care.
        9. No chargeable floor area above the base FAR shall be granted to any proposed development that would result in significant alteration to any designated feature of a Landmark structure, unless a certificate of approval for the alteration is granted by the Landmarks Preservation Board.
        10. On a lot entirely in a DOC1 zone, additional chargeable floor area equal to 1.0 FAR may be permitted above the increment achieved through a commitment as prescribed in subsection 23.49.011.A.2.a, or above the base FAR after expiration of that subsection 23.49.011.A.2.a, on a lot that includes one or more qualifying Landmarks, subject to the following conditions:

            1. the structure is rehabilitated to the extent necessary so that all features and characteristics controlled or designated by ordinance pursuant to Chapter 25.12 or Ordinance 102229 are in good condition and consistent with the applicable ordinances and with any certificates of approval issued by the Landmarks Preservation Board, all as determined by the Director of Neighborhoods; and
            2. a notice shall be recorded in the King County real estate records, in form satisfactory to the Director, regarding the bonus allowed and the effect thereof under the terms of this Chapter 23.49. For purposes of this Section 23.49.011, a "qualifying Landmark" is a structure that

                1. has a gross floor area above grade of at least 5,000 square feet;
                2. is separate from the principal structure or structures existing or to be developed on the lot, except that it may abut and connect with one such structure along one exterior wall;
                3. is subject, in whole or in part, to a designating ordinance pursuant to Chapter 25.12, or was designated pursuant to Ordinance 102229; and
                4. is on a lot on which no improvement, object, feature or characteristic has been altered or removed contrary to any provision of Chapter 25.12 or any designating ordinance. A qualifying Landmark for which a bonus is allowed under this subsection 23.49.011.A.2.j shall be considered a public benefit feature, but shall not be considered an amenity for purposes of Section 23.49.013. For so long as any of the chargeable floor area allowed under this subsection 23.49.011.A.2.j remains on the lot, each qualifying Landmark for which such bonus was granted shall remain designated as a Landmark under Chapter 25.12 and the owner shall maintain the exterior and interior of each qualifying Landmark in good condition and repair and in a manner that preserves the features and characteristics that are subject to designation or controls by ordinance, and that maintains compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and local laws, ordinances, regulations, and restrictions.
        11. On a lot entirely in a DOC1 zone, as an incentive to maintain diversity in the scale of downtown development, additional floor area equal to 0.5 FAR may be granted above the increment achieved through a commitment as prescribed in subsection 23.49.011.A.2.a, or above the base FAR after expiration of that subsection 23.48.011.A.2.a, on a lot that includes one or more qualifying small structures, subject to the conditions in this subsection 23.49.011.A.2.k.

            1. A "qualifying small structure" is one that satisfies all of the following standards:

                1. the gross floor area of the structure above grade is a minimum of 5,000 square feet and does not exceed 50,000 square feet;
                2. the height of the structure is 125 feet or less, not including rooftop features as specified in subsection 23.49.008.D;
                3. the structure was not constructed or substantially structurally modified since July 13, 1982; and
                4. the structure is not occupied by parking above the ground floor.
            2. If the structure is removed from the lot or ceases to be a qualifying small structure, then any development on the portion of the lot previously occupied by the structure, defined by a rectangle enclosing the exterior walls of the structure as they exist at the time the bonus is granted and extended to the nearest street frontage, shall be limited to a maximum floor area of 50,000 square feet for all uses and a maximum height of 125 feet, excluding any rooftop features as specified in subsection 23.49.008.D.
            3. A notice shall be recorded in the King County real estate records, in form satisfactory to the Director, regarding the bonus allowed and the effect thereof under the terms of this Chapter 23.49.
            4. Bonus floor area under this subsection 23.49.011.A.2.k may not be granted on the basis of a Landmark structure for which bonus floor area is allowed under subsection 23.49.011.A.2.j, but may be allowed on the basis of a different structure or structures that are on the same lot as a Landmark structure for which such bonus floor area is allowed.
        12. Chargeable floor area in excess of the base FAR in the PSM 85-120 zone may be gained only in accordance with Section 23.49.180.
        13. In IDM, DMR and DMC zones within South Downtown, chargeable floor area in excess of the base FAR may be obtained only by qualifying for floor area bonuses pursuant to Sections 23.58A.024 and 23.49.013, or by the transfer of transferable development rights pursuant to Section 23.49.014, or both, and except as permitted in subsection 23.49.011.A.2.h, only if the conditions of this subsection 23.49.011.A.2.m also are satisfied:

            1. For a new structure, the applicant makes a commitment, approved by the Director as a Type I decision, that the proposed development will earn a LEED Silver rating or meet a substantially equivalent standard. If such a commitment is made, Section 23.49.020 applies.
            2. Seventy-five percent of the chargeable floor area in excess of base FAR shall be gained through bonuses under Section 23.58A.024 or through use of Housing TDR from within South Downtown.
            3. Twenty-five percent of the chargeable floor area in excess of base FAR shall be gained by one or any combination of transferable development rights or public open space amenities, subject to the conditions and limits of this Section 23.49.011, Section 23.49.013, and Section 23.49.014:

                1. TDR that may be used on a lot in South Downtown are limited to South Downtown Historic TDR, open space TDR from within South Downtown, or any combination of these consistent with this Chapter 23.49.
                2. Amenities eligible for a bonus on a lot in South Downtown are limited to public open space amenities pursuant to Section 23.49.013.
    3. In a DOC1, DOC2, DRC, or DMC zone, for a lot that includes a qualifying Landmark structure with a performing arts theater, the base FAR specified in Table A for 23.49.011 is increased by 4 FAR, or by the amount of FAR between the base and maximum FAR of the zone, whichever is less, provided that the conditions of this subsection 23.49.011.A.3 are met.

        1. For purposes of this subsection 23.49.011.A.3, a "qualifying Landmark structure with a performing arts theater" is a structure that is a designated Landmark pursuant to Chapter 25.12 and that meets the following:

            1. the structure was built before 1930;
            2. the structure contains performing arts theater space that has combined seating capacity in one or more venues for at least 800; and
            3. the structure is subject to an ordinance granting incentives for and imposing controls on the Landmark structure.
        2. At the time a qualifying Landmark structure with a performing arts theater uses the additional base FAR, either on the site or through transfer of TDR to another site, the following conditions shall be met:

            1. the performing arts theater use established under approved permits, including combined seating capacity in one or more venues for at least 800, shall be ensured by binding covenants between the property owner and the City for at least 40 years from the first use of any of the additional base FAR, either on the site or through the first transfer of any TDR to another site; and
            2. the Director, after consulting with the property owner, determines, as a Type I decision, that the property owner has executed a contract(s) with one or more theater groups or performing arts organizations for regularly scheduled use of the Landmark structure for live performances and that the anticipated use of the Landmark theater structure for live theater performances, combined with any other use of the structure, is adequate to contribute sufficiently to the presence of live theater in the Downtown Historic Theatre District established by Resolution 31341 and to support the desired level of activity in the area near the Landmark structure. In making this determination, the Director shall consider the following:

                1. the extent and duration of the contract(s) between the property owner and one or more theater groups or performing arts organizations for regularly scheduled use of the Landmark structure for live performances;
                2. the presence of uses in the structure that will contribute to activity in the area beyond the typical workday hours; and
                3. programmed use of the Landmark structure by other activities during periods when the structure is not in use for live performances; and
            3. any use of the additional base FAR on the site complies with all provisions of the designating ordinance and Chapter 25.12.
        3. If a Landmark structure is on a lot that is not entirely regulated by a designating ordinance, then the area used to calculate the additional base FAR is the area of the footprint of the Landmark structure.
        4. A lot that uses the additional base FAR on the site as allowed by this subsection 23.49.011.A.3 is not allowed to gain chargeable floor area under subsection 23.49.011.A.2.j.
        5. If a qualifying Landmark structure with a performing arts theater is on a lot that is not entirely regulated by a designating ordinance, then the additional base FAR may be transferred as TDR to another site, or may be used on the site on the portion of the lot that is within the footprint of the Landmark structure, but shall not be used elsewhere on the lot.
    4. The Master Use Permit application to establish any bonus development under this subsection 23.49.011.A.4 shall include a calculation of the amount of bonus development sought and shall identify the manner in which the conditions to such bonus development shall be satisfied. The Director shall, at the time of issuance of any Master Use Permit decision approving any such bonus development, issue a Type I decision as to the amount of bonus development to be allowed and the conditions to such bonus development, which decision may include alternative means to achieve bonus development, at the applicant's option, if each alternative would be consistent with this Section 23.49.011 and any other conditions of the permit, including Design Review if applicable.

            1. The floor area is interior space of historic or architectural interest designed to accommodate the original function of the structure, and maintaining the integrity of this space prevents it from being fully utilized as commercial floor area;
            2. The floor area is occupied by such uses as public assembly or performance space, human services, or indoor public amenities, including atrium or lobby area available for passive indoor recreation use or for the display of art or other objects of scientific, social, historic, cultural, educational or aesthetic interest; and
            3. The floor area is open and accessible to the public without charge, on reasonable terms and conditions consistent with the nature of the space, during normal operating hours of the building;

        2. Mechanical equipment located on the roof of a structure shall not be calculated as part of the total gross floor area of the structure.

##### 23.49.012 - Bonus floor area for voluntary agreements for housing and child care

If and when the City becomes entitled to realize on any security, the Director of Housing shall take appropriate steps to do so, and the amounts realized, net of any costs to the City, shall be used in the same manner as cash contributions for housing made under this Section 23.49.012. In the case of any project proposing to use bonus floor area for which no building permit is required, references to the building permit in subsection 23.49.012.B.1 shall mean the Master Use Permit allowing establishment or expansion of the use for which bonus floor area is sought.


1. Nothing in this Chapter 23.49 shall be construed to confer on any owner or developer of housing, any party to a linkage agreement, or any assignee, any development rights or property interests. Because the availability and terms of allowance of bonus floor area depend upon the regulations in effect at the relevant time for the project proposing to use the bonus floor area, pursuant to Section 23.76.026, any approvals or agreements by the Director of Housing regarding the eligibility of actual or proposed housing as to satisfy conditions of a bonus, and any approval of a linkage agreement and/or assignment, do not grant any vested rights, nor guarantee that any bonus floor area will be permitted based on the housing.
2. The Director of Housing shall review the design and proposed management plan for any housing proposed under the performance option to determine whether it will comply with the terms of this Section 23.49.012.
3. The Director of Housing is authorized to accept a voluntary agreement for the provision of housing and related agreements and instruments consistent with this Section 23.49.012.
4. Any provision of any Director's rule notwithstanding, the housing units shall continue to satisfy the applicable requirements of subsection 23.49.012.B.1 throughout the required 50 year period and that compliance shall be documented annually to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing, and the owner of any project using the bonus floor area shall be in violation of this Title 23 if any housing unit does not satisfy applicable requirements, or if satisfactory documentation is not provided to the Director of the Office of Housing, at any time during that period. The Director of Housing may provide by rule for circumstances in which housing units may be replaced if lost due to casualty or other causes, and for terms and conditions upon which a cash contribution may be made in lieu of continuing to provide housing units under the terms of subsection 23.49.012.B.1. If housing is provided for owner occupancy pursuant to an agreement under subsection 23.49.012.B.1, the owner of any project using the bonus floor area shall be in violation of this Title 23 if the first sale or other transfer of a housing unit after it becomes subject to that agreement is not made to a low-income household or is not made on the terms and subject to the recorded instrument provided in subsection 23.49.012.B.1.b.2, which shall be a continuing violation until that unit or another unit accepted by the Director of Housing in substitution for it is sold to a low-income household on those terms, and subject to a recorded instrument as described in that subsection 23.49.012.B.1.b.2.
5. Housing units provided to qualify for a bonus, or produced with voluntary contributions made under this Section 23.49.012, should include a range of unit sizes, including units suitable for families with children. The Director of Housing is authorized to prescribe by rule minimum requirements for the range of unit sizes, by numbers of bedrooms, in housing provided to qualify for a bonus. The Director of Housing shall take into account, in any such rule, estimated distributions of household sizes among low-income households. The Director of Housing is further authorized to adopt policies for distribution of unit sizes in housing developments funded by contributions received under this Section 23.49.012.
6. Any failure of the low-income housing to satisfy the requirements of subsection 23.49.012.B.1 shall not affect the right to maintain or occupy the bonus floor area if the Director of Housing certifies to the Director that either:

    1. The applicant has provided the City with a letter of credit or other sufficient security pursuant to subsection 23.49.012.B.1.d; or
    2. There have been recorded one or more agreements or instruments satisfactory to the Director of Housing providing for occupancy and affordability restrictions on low-income housing with the minimum floor area determined under subsection 23.49.012.B.1, all low-income housing has been completed, and the low-income housing is on a different lot from the bonus floor area or is in one or more condominium units separate from the bonus development under condominium documents acceptable to the Director of Housing.
7. Unless and until the Director of Housing certifies as set forth in subsection 23.49.012.B.1.j, it shall be a continuing permit condition, whether or not expressly stated, for each development obtaining bonus floor area based on the provision of low-income housing to which this Section 23.49.012 applies, that the low-income housing shall be maintained in compliance with the terms of this Section 23.49.012 and any applicable provisions of the zone, as documented to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing.
8. Child Care.

    1. For each square foot of bonus floor area allowed under this section, in addition to providing housing or an alternative cash contribution pursuant to subsection 23.49.012.B.1, the applicant shall provide fully improved child care facility space sufficient for 0.000127 of a child care slot, or a cash contribution to the City of $3.25 to be administered by the Human Services Department. From the effective date of the ordinance introduced as Council Bill 117908 to June 30, 2014, the alternative cash contribution is $3.97 per gross square foot of bonus floor area obtained through the payment option. From July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015, the alternative cash contribution is $4.32 per gross square foot of bonus floor area obtained through the payment option plus the product of $4.32 times the 2013 annual average change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index. On July 1, 2015 and on the same day annually thereafter the alternative cash contribution amount in this subsection 23.49.012.B.2.a shall automatically adjust in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index, from January 1, 2014 or the time the alternative cash contribution was last adjusted, whichever is later. The amount of the alternative cash contribution made at the time specified in subsection 23.49.012.C shall be based on the alternative cash contribution amount that is in effect when vesting of a Master Use Permit occurs under Section 23.76.026. The minimum interior space in the child care facility for each child care slot shall comply with all applicable state and local regulations governing the operation of licensed childcare providers. Child care facility space shall be deemed provided only if the applicant causes the space to be newly constructed or newly placed in child care use after the submission of a permit application for the project intended to use the bonus floor area, except as provided in subsection 23.49.012.B.2.b.6. If any contribution or subsidy in any form is made by any public entity to the acquisition, development, financing or improvement of any child care facility, then any portion of the space in such facility determined by the Director of the Human Services Department to be attributable to such contribution or subsidy shall not be considered as provided by any applicant other than that public entity.
    2. Child care space shall be provided on the same lot as the project using the bonus floor area or on another lot in a downtown zone and shall be contained in a child care facility satisfying the following standards:

        1. The child care facility and accessory exterior space must be approved for licensing by the State of Washington Department of Social and Health Services and any other applicable state or local governmental agencies responsible for the regulation of licensed childcare providers.
        2. At least 20 percent of the number of child care slots for which space is provided as a condition of bonus floor area must be reserved for, and affordable to, families with annual incomes at or below the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Low Income Standard for Section 8 Housing based on family size (or, if such standard shall no longer be published, a standard established by the Human Services Director based generally on 80 percent of the median family income of the Metropolitan Statistical Area, or division thereof, that includes Seattle, adjusted for family size). Child care slots shall be deemed to meet these conditions if they serve, and are limited to, a) children receiving child care subsidy from the City of Seattle, King County or State Department of Social and Health Services, and/or b) children whose families have annual incomes no higher than the above standard who are charged according to a sliding fee scale such that the fees paid by any family do not exceed the amount it would be charged, exclusive of subsidy, if the family were enrolled in the City of Seattle Child Care Subsidy Program.
        3. Child care space provided to satisfy bonus conditions shall be dedicated to child care use, consistent with the terms of this section, for 20 years. The dedication shall be established by a recorded covenant, running with the land, and enforceable by the City, signed by the owner of the lot where the child care facility is located and by the owner of the lot where the bonus floor area is used, if different from the lot of the child care facility. The child care facility shall be maintained in operation, with adequate staffing, at least 11 hours per day, five days per week, 50 weeks per year.
        4. Exterior space for which a bonus is or has been allowed under any other section of this title or under former Title 24 shall not be eligible to satisfy the conditions of this section.
        5. Unless the applicant is the owner of the child care space and is a duly licensed and experienced child care provider approved by the Director of the Human Services Department, the applicant shall provide to the Director a signed agreement, acceptable to such Director, with a duly licensed child care provider, under which the child care provider agrees to operate the child care facility consistent with the terms of this section and of the recorded covenant, and to provide reports and documentation to the City to demonstrate such compliance.
        6. One child care facility may fulfill the conditions for a bonus for more than one project if it includes sufficient space, and provides sufficient slots affordable to limited income families, to satisfy the conditions for each such project without any space or child care slot being counted toward the conditions for more than one project. If the child care facility is located on the same lot as one of the projects using the bonus, then the owner of that lot shall be responsible for maintaining compliance with all the requirements applicable to the child care facility; otherwise responsibility for such requirements shall be allocated by agreement in such manner as the Director of the Human Services Department may approve. If a child care facility developed to qualify for bonus floor area by one applicant includes space exceeding the amount necessary for the bonus floor area used by that applicant, then to the extent that the voluntary agreement accepted by the Director of the Human Services Department from that applicant so provides, such excess space may be deemed provided by the applicant for a later project pursuant to a new voluntary agreement signed by both such applicants and by any other owner of the child care facility, and a modification of the recorded covenant, each in form and substance acceptable to such Director.
    3. The Director of the Human Services Department shall review the design and proposed management plan for any child care facility proposed to qualify for bonus floor area to determine whether it will comply with the terms of this Section 23.49.012. The allowance of bonus floor area is conditioned upon approval of the design and proposed management plan by the Director. The child care facility shall be constructed consistent with the design approved by such Director and shall be operated for the minimum 20 year term consistent with the management plan approved by such Director, in each case with only such modifications as shall be approved by such Director. If the proposed management plan includes provisions for payment of rent or occupancy costs by the provider, the management plan must include a detailed operating budget, staffing ratios, and other information requested by the Director to assess whether the child care facility may be economically feasible and able to deliver quality services.
    4. The Director of the Human Services Department is authorized to accept a voluntary agreement for the provision of a child care facility to satisfy bonus conditions and related agreements and instruments consistent with this Section 23.49.012. The voluntary agreement may provide, in case a child care facility is not maintained in continuous operation consistent with this subsection 23.49.012.B.2 at any time within the minimum 20 year period, for the City's right to receive payment of a prorated amount of the alternative cash contribution that then would be applicable to a new project seeking bonus floor area. Such Director may require security or evidence of adequate financial responsibility, or both, as a condition to acceptance of an agreement under this subsection 23.49.012.B.2.

1. General provisions

    1. The purpose of this Section 23.49.012 is to encourage development in addition to that authorized by basic zoning regulations ("bonus development"), provided that certain adverse impacts from the bonus development are mitigated. Two impacts from additional development are an increased need for low-income housing to house the families of downtown workers having lower-paid jobs and an increased need for child care for downtown workers.
    2. If an applicant elects to seek approval of bonus development pursuant to this Section 23.49.012, the applicant must execute a voluntary agreement with the City in which the applicant agrees to provide mitigation for the impacts identified in subsection 23.49.012.A.1. In the absence of a signed voluntary agreement, acceptance of a permit for any bonus development allowed under this Section 23.49.012 shall constitute a voluntary agreement on the terms set forth in this Section 23.49.012. The mitigation may be provided by building the requisite low-income housing or child care facilities (the "performance option"), by making a contribution to be used by the City to build or provide the housing and child care facilities (the "payment option"), or by a combination of the performance and payment options.
    3. For purposes of this Section 23.49.012, a housing unit serves low-income households only if either:

        1. For a period of 50 years beginning upon the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy by the Department for the project using the bonus development, the housing unit is used as rental housing solely for low-income households, at rent limited so that annual housing costs, including rent and basic utilities, do not exceed 30 percent of 80 percent of median income, and the housing unit and the structure in which it is located are maintained in decent and habitable condition, including adequate basic appliances in the housing unit; or
        2. The unit is sold for owner-occupancy to a low-income household at an initial sale price limited so that the annual housing costs, including mortgage principal and interest, real estate taxes, and insurance plus homeowner dues if applicable, are not expected to exceed 35 percent of 80 percent of median income, according to a calculation based on reasonable assumptions and approved by the Director of Housing, and the unit is subject to a recorded instrument satisfactory to the Director of Housing with a term of 50 years beginning upon the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy by the Department for the project using the bonus development, providing for sales prices on any resale consistent with affordability on the same basis as the initial sale, allowing resales only to low-income households, and requiring that upon any resale the housing unit be in decent and habitable condition, including adequate basic appliances, for such 50 year period.
2. Voluntary agreements for housing and child care. The voluntary agreement shall commit the developer to provide or contribute to the following facilities in the following amounts:

    1. Housing

        1. Housing serving low-income households equal to at least 15.6 percent of each gross square foot of bonus floor area obtained through the performance option must be provided. A cash contribution for each gross square foot of bonus floor area obtained through the payment option, as an alternative to the performance option, for housing to serve low-income households must be provided. The alternative cash contribution is $18.75 per gross square foot of bonus floor area obtained through the payment option, subject to adjustment under this subsection 23.49.012.B.1.a. From the effective date of the ordinance introduced as Council Bill 117908 to June 30, 2014, the alternative cash contribution is $22.88 per gross square foot of bonus floor area obtained through the payment option. From July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015, the alternative cash contribution is $24.95 per gross square foot of bonus floor area obtained through the payment option plus the product of $24.95 times the 2013 annual average change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index. On July 1, 2015, and on the same day annually thereafter the alternative cash contribution amount in this subsection 23.49.012.B.1.a shall automatically adjust in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index, from January 1, 2014, or the time the alternative cash contribution was last adjusted, whichever is later.
        2. For the performance option, housing serving low-income households must be provided within the project using the bonus development unless the Director, after consultation with the Director of Housing, approves an alternate location, as a Type I decision. In determining whether to approve an alternate location, the Director shall consider the extent to which low-income housing at that location would mitigate the impact of the development on the need for low-income housing serving downtown workers. The alternate location must be in one of the following areas, prioritized in the following order:

            1. within the Downtown Urban Center;
            2. within an Urban Center adjacent to the Downtown Urban Center;
            3. in the City within 0.5 mile of a light rail or bus rapid transit station on a route serving the Downtown Urban Center;
            4. in the City within 0.25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop on a route serving the Downtown Urban Center.
        3. For purposes of this Section 23.49.012, housing may be considered to be provided by the applicant seeking bonus floor area if:

            1. It is committed to serve low-income households pursuant to an agreement between the housing owner and the City executed and recorded prior to the issuance of the building permit for the housing, but no earlier than three years prior to the issuance of a Master Use Permit for the project using the bonus floor area; and
            2. The housing is newly constructed, is converted from non-residential use, or is renovated; and:

                1. The housing is owned by the applicant seeking to use the bonus; or
                2. The owner of the housing has signed, and there is in effect, a linkage agreement approved by the Director of Housing allowing the use of the housing bonus in return for necessary and adequate financial support to the development of the housing, and either the applicant has, by the terms of the linkage agreement, the exclusive privilege to use the housing to satisfy conditions for bonus floor area; or the applicant is the assignee of the privilege to use the housing to satisfy conditions for bonus floor area, pursuant to a full and exclusive assignment, approved by the Director of Housing, of the linkage agreement, and all provisions of this Section 23.49.012 respecting assignments are complied with. If housing is developed in advance of a linkage agreement, payments by the applicant used to retire or reduce interim financing may be considered necessary and adequate support for the development of the housing.
        4. Housing that is not yet constructed, or is not ready for occupancy, at the time of the issuance of a building permit for the project intending to use bonus floor area, may be considered to be provided by the applicant if, within three years of the issuance of the first building permit for that project, the Department issues a final certificate of occupancy for such housing. Any applicant seeking to qualify for bonus floor area based on housing that is not ready for occupancy shall provide to the City, prior to the date when a contribution would be due for the cash option under subsection 23.49.012.C, an irrevocable bank letter of credit or other sufficient security approved by the Director of Housing, and a related voluntary agreement, so that at the end of the three year period, if the housing does not qualify or is not provided in a sufficient amount to satisfy the terms of this Section 23.49.012, the City shall receive:

            1. a cash contribution for housing in the amount determined pursuant to this Section 23.49.012 after credit for any qualifying housing then provided; plus
            2. an amount equal to interest on the contribution, at the rate equal to the prime rate quoted from time to time by Bank of America, or its successor, plus three percent per annum, from the date of issuance of the first building permit for the project using the bonus.
3. Cash Option Payments. Cash payments under voluntary agreements for bonuses shall be made prior to issuance of any building permit after the first building permit for a project, and in any event before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued, or if the bonus is for use of existing floor area, the cash payment shall be made prior to issuance of any permit or modification allowing for use of the space as chargeable floor area. The payments shall be deposited in special accounts established solely to fund expenditures for the development of low-income housing and childcare. Earnings on balances in the special accounts shall accrue to those accounts. Cash payments made in lieu of providing low-income housing and any earnings thereon shall be deposited in the Low Income Housing Fund and used by the Director of Housing to support development of low-income housing, including renter or owner housing, which support may include financing property purchase for the purpose of providing low-income housing. Payments in lieu of low-income housing also may be used for loans or grants to low-income households for home purchases. The Human Services Director shall use cash payments made in lieu of child care facilities and any earnings thereon to support development of child care facilities. Uses of funds to support housing and child care facilities may include the City's costs to administer projects, not to exceed ten percent of total payments under this section and of any earnings thereon, and support provided through loans or grants to owners or developers. The location of low-income housing and child care facilities funded wholly or in part with cash payments shall be prioritized in the following order: 1) within the Downtown Urban Center; 2) within an Urban Center adjacent to the Downtown Urban Center; 3) in the City within 0.5 mile of a light rail or bus rapid transit station on a route serving the Downtown Urban Center; 4) in the City within 0.25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop on a route serving the Downtown Urban Center. Housing units that are funded with cash contributions under this section shall be generally comparable in their average size and quality of construction to other housing units in the same structure, in the judgment of the Director of Housing.
4. No Subsidies for Bonused Housing: Exception.

    1. Intent. Housing provided through the bonus system is intended to mitigate a portion of the additional housing needs resulting from increased density, beyond those needs that would otherwise exist, which the City and other governmental and charitable entities attempt to meet through various subsidy programs. Allowing bonus floor area under the performance option for housing that uses such subsidy programs therefore could undermine the intent of this section.
    2. Agreement Concerning Subsidies. The Director of the Office of Housing may require, as a condition of any bonus floor area for housing under the performance option, that the owner of the lot upon which the housing is located agree not to seek or accept any subsidies, including without limitation those items referred to in subsection D3 of this section, related to the housing, except for any subsidies that may be allowed by the Director of the Office of Housing under that subsection. The Director may require that such agreement provide for the payment to the City, for deposit in the Downtown Housing Bonus Account, of the value of any subsidies received in excess of any amounts allowed by such agreement.
    3. No Bonus for Subsidized or Restricted Housing. In general, no bonus may be earned by providing housing if:

        1. Any person is receiving or will receive with respect to the housing any charitable contributions or public subsidies for housing development or operation, including, but not limited to, tax exempt bond financing, tax credits, federal loans or grants. City of Seattle housing loans or grants, county housing funds, State of Washington housing funds, or property tax exemptions or other special tax treatment; or
        2. The housing is or would be, independent of the requirements for the bonus, subject to any restrictions on the use, occupancy or rents.
    4. Exceptions by Rule. The Director of the Office of Housing may provide, by rule promulgated after the effective date of this ordinance, for terms and conditions on which exceptions to the restriction on subsidies in this subsection may be allowed. Such rule may provide that, as a condition to any exception, the Director of the Office of Housing shall increase the amount of housing floor area per bonus square foot, as set forth in subsection B1 of this section, to an amount that allows credit for only the Director's estimate of the incremental effect, in meeting the City's housing needs for the next fifty (50) years, of the net financial contribution that is being made by the applicant pursuant to the voluntary agreement and not funded or reimbursed, directly or indirectly, from any other source.

##### 23.49.013 - Bonus floor area for amenities

1. An applicant may achieve a portion of the chargeable floor area to be established in addition to base FAR through bonuses for amenities, subject to the limits in this Chapter 23.49. Amenities for which bonuses may be allowed are limited to:

            4. Departures from standards for the minimum size of off-site open space and maximum distance from the project may be allowed by the Director as a Type I decision if the Director determines that if such departures are approved, the proposed open space will meet the additional need for open space caused by the project, and improve public access to the open space compared to provision of the open space on-site.
            5. The owner of any lot on which off-site open space is provided to meet the requirements of this Section 23.49.013 shall execute and record an easement or other instrument in a form acceptable to the Director assuring compliance with the requirements of this Section 23.49.013, including applicable conditions of the Downtown Amenity Standards.
        3. Public restrooms shall be on a ground floor; shall satisfy all codes and accessibility standards; shall be open to the general public during hours that the structure is open to the public, although access may be monitored by a person located at the restroom facility; shall be maintained by the owner of the structure for the life of the structure that includes the bonused space; and shall be designated by signs sufficient so that they are readily located by pedestrians on an abutting street or public open space.

2. Standards for Sending Lots.

    1. Maximum transferable floor area except from lots in South Downtown. This subsection 23.49.014.B.1 applies to sending lots that are not in South Downtown.

        1. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred, except as open space TDR, Landmark TDR, or Landmark housing TDR, from an eligible sending lot, is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, exceeds the sum of any chargeable gross floor area existing or, if a DMC housing TDR site, to be developed on the sending lot, plus any TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.
        2. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible open space TDR site is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, exceeds the sum of (a) any existing chargeable gross floor area that is built on or over the portion of the sending lot that is not made ineligible by subsection 23.49.017.C, plus (b) the amount, if any, by which the total of any other chargeable floor area on the sending lot exceeds the product of the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, multiplied by the difference between the total lot area and the eligible lot area, plus (c) any TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.
        3. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible Landmark housing TDR site is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, exceeds TDR previously transferred from the sending lot, if any.
        4. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible Landmark TDR site, if the chargeable floor area of the landmark structure is less than or equal to the base FAR permitted in the zone, is equivalent to the base FAR of the sending lot, minus any TDR that have been previously transferred. For landmark structures having chargeable floor area greater than the base FAR of the zone, the amount of floor area that may be transferred is limited to an amount equivalent to the base FAR of the sending lot minus the sum of (a) any chargeable floor area of the landmark structure exceeding the base FAR and (b) any TDR that have been previously transferred.
        5. For purposes of this subsection 23.49.014.B.1, the eligible lot area is the total area of the sending lot, reduced by the excess, if any, of the total of accessory surface parking over ¼ of the total area of the footprints of all structures on the sending lot; and for an open space TDR site, further reduced by the area of any portion of the lot ineligible under subsection 23.49.017.C.
    2. TDR from lots in South Downtown. This subsection 23.49.014.B.2 applies to sending lots in South Downtown.

        1. If the sending lot is located in a PSM or IDM zone, then subject to any lower limit under this subsection 23.49.014.B.2, the gross floor area that may be transferred is six times the lot area, minus the sum of any existing chargeable floor area and further reduced by any TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.
        2. If the sending lot is not located in a PSM or IDM zone, then subject to any lower limit under this subsection 23.49.014.B.2, the gross floor area that may be transferred is the amount by which the product of the eligible lot area times the base FAR of the sending lot, as provided in Section 23.49.011, exceeds the sum of any chargeable floor area existing on the sending lot, plus any TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.
        3. The cumulative amount of housing TDR transferred from any lot in South Downtown shall not exceed three times the lot area.
        4. The cumulative amount of open space TDR transferred from any lot in South Downtown shall not exceed three times the lot area.
        5. The cumulative amount of South Downtown Historic TDR transferred from any lot shall not exceed three times the lot area.
        6. The cumulative combined amount of TDR and TDP transferred from any lot in South Downtown shall not exceed six times the lot area.
        7. For purposes of this subsection 23.49.014.B.2, the eligible lot area is the total area of the sending lot, reduced by the excess, if any, of the total of accessory surface parking over 1/4 of the total area of the footprints of all structures on the sending lot; and for an open space TDR site, further reduced by any portion of the lot ineligible under subsection 23.49.017.C.
    3. Effect of transfer in zones with base FAR limits. If TDR are transferred from a sending lot in a zone with a base FAR limit, except an IDM zone, the amount of chargeable floor area that may then be established on the sending lot is equal to the amount by which the area of the lot, multiplied by the applicable base FAR limit set in Section 23.49.011, exceeds the total of:

        1. The existing chargeable floor area on the lot; plus
        2. The amount of gross floor area transferred from the lot.
    4. Effect of transfer in PSM and IDM zones.

        1. If TDR are transferred from a sending lot in a PSM zone, the amount of chargeable floor area that may then be established on the sending lot is equal to the amount by which the total gross floor area that could have been built on the sending lot consistent with applicable development standards as determined by the Director had no TDR been transferred exceeds the sum of:

            1. The existing chargeable floor area on the lot; plus
            2. The gross floor area of TDR transferred from the lot.
        2. If TDR are transferred from a sending lot in an IDM zone, the amount of chargeable floor area that may then be established on the sending lot shall not exceed the amount by which the applicable base FAR limit in Section 23.49.011 multiplied by the lot area exceeds the sum of:

            1. The existing chargeable floor area on the lot; plus
            2. The gross floor area of TDR transferred from the lot.
    5. TDR from lots with more than base FAR not allowed; exception. Gross floor area allowed above base FAR under any bonus provisions of this Title 23 or the former Title 24, or allowed under any exceptions or waivers of development standards, may not be transferred. TDR may be transferred from a lot that contains chargeable floor area exceeding the base FAR only if the TDR are from an eligible Landmark TDR site, consistent with subsection 23.49.014.B.1.c, or to the extent, if any, that:

        1. TDR were previously transferred to such lot in compliance with the Land Use Code provisions and applicable rules then in effect;
        2. Those TDR, together with the base FAR under Section 23.49.011, exceed the chargeable floor area on the lot and any additional chargeable floor area for which any permit has been issued or for which any permit application is pending; and
        3. The excess amount of TDR previously transferred to such lot would have been eligible for transfer from the original sending lot under Section 23.49.014 at the time of their original transfer from that lot.
    6. Rehabilitation of Landmark structures and contributing structures. Landmark structures on sending lots from which Landmark TDR or Landmark housing TDR are transferred shall be rehabilitated and maintained as required by the Landmarks Preservation Board. Contributing structures under Section 23.66.032 on sending lots from which South Downtown Historic TDR are transferred shall be rehabilitated and maintained as required by the Director of Neighborhoods upon recommendation by the International Special Review District Board or the Pioneer Square Preservation Board.
    7. Rehabilitation of housing. Housing on lots from which housing TDR are transferred shall be rehabilitated to the extent required to provide decent, sanitary and habitable conditions, in compliance with applicable codes, and so as to have an estimated minimum useful life of at least 50 years from the time of the TDR transfer, as approved by the Director of Housing. Landmark buildings on lots from which Landmark housing TDR are transferred shall be rehabilitated to the extent required to provide decent, sanitary and habitable housing, in compliance with applicable codes, and so as to have an estimated minimum useful life of at least 50 years from the time of the TDR transfer, as approved by the Director of Housing and Director of Neighborhoods. If housing TDR or Landmark housing TDR are proposed to be transferred prior to the completion of work necessary to satisfy this subsection 23.49.014.B.7, the Director of Housing may require, as a condition to such transfer, that security be deposited with the City to ensure the completion of such work.
    8. Low-income housing units. The housing units on a lot from which housing TDR, Landmark housing TDR, or DMC housing TDR are transferred, and that are committed to low-income housing use as a condition to eligibility of the lot as a TDR sending lot, shall be generally comparable in their average size and quality of construction to other housing units in the same structure, in the judgment of the Director of Housing, after completion of any rehabilitation or construction undertaken in order to qualify as a TDR sending lot.
    9. Standards for eligibility as a South Downtown Historic TDR sending lot.

        1. In order to be eligible to transfer South Downtown Historic TDR, a lot must contain a structure that includes at least 5,000 gross square feet in above-grade space and was finally determined to be a contributing structure under Section 23.66.032.
        2. Contributing structures on a sending lot from which South Downtown Historic TDR are transferred shall be rehabilitated and maintained as required by the Director of Neighborhoods.
        3. As a condition to finally allow the transfer of South Downtown Historic TDR from a lot, the applicant must certify that the contributing structure continues to meet any conditions identified by the Director of Neighborhoods pursuant to subsection 23.66.032.C within no more than three years prior to the recordation of the deed conveying the TDR from the sending lot.
        4. South Downtown Historic TDR shall not be transferred from a lot from which South Downtown Historic TDP has been transferred or from a lot on which any extra floor area has been established based on the presence of a contributing structure.
3. Limit on within-block TDR. Any receiving lot is limited to a gain of 15 percent of the floor area above the first increment of FAR above the base FAR, as specified in subsection 23.49.011.A.2.a, from TDR from sending lots that are eligible to send TDR solely because they are on the same block as the receiving lot.
4. Transfer of development rights deeds and agreements

    1. The fee owners of the sending lot shall execute a deed, shall obtain the release of the TDR from all liens of record, and shall obtain the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot other than easements and restrictions, unless the requirement for a release or consent is waived by the Director for good cause. The deed shall be recorded in the King County real property records. If TDR are conveyed to the owner of a receiving lot described in the deed, then unless otherwise expressly stated in the deed or any subsequent instrument conveying such lot or the TDR, the TDR shall pass with the receiving lot whether or not a structure using such TDR shall have been permitted or built prior to any conveyance of the receiving lot. Any subsequent conveyance of TDR previously conveyed to a receiving lot shall require the written consent of all parties holding any interest in or lien on the receiving lot from which the conveyance is made. If the TDR are transferred other than directly from the sending lot to the receiving lot using the TDR, then after the initial transfer, all subsequent transfers also shall be by deed, duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, each referring by King County recording number to the prior deed. Any deed conveying any South Downtown Historic TDR from the sending lot shall include a sworn certification by the grantor to the effect that one or more structures on the sending lot have been finally determined to be contributing structures pursuant to Section 23.66.032, and that since the date of such determination there have been no material changes to any contributing structure on the sending lot, except pursuant to a certificate of approval specifically stating that the authorized change will not affect the status of the structure as a contributing structure. Any false certification by the grantor in a deed under this subsection 23.49.014.D.1 is a violation of this Title 23.
    2. Any person may purchase any TDR that are eligible for transfer by complying with the applicable provisions of this Section 23.49.014, whether or not the purchaser is then an applicant for a permit to develop downtown real property. Any purchaser of such TDR (including any successor or assignee) may use such TDR to obtain chargeable floor area above the applicable base on a receiving lot to the extent such use of TDR is permitted under the Land Use Code provisions in effect on the date of vesting, under applicable law, of such person's rights with respect to the issuance of permits for development of the project intended to use such TDR. The Director may require, as a condition of processing any permit application using TDR or for the release of any security posted in lieu of a deed for TDR to the receiving lot, that the owner of the receiving lot demonstrate that the TDR have been validly transferred of record to the receiving lot, and that such owner has recorded in the real estate records a notice of the filing of such permit application, stating that such TDR are not available for retransfer.
    3. For transfers of housing TDR, Landmark housing TDR, or DMC housing TDR, the owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement, with the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot, unless such consent is waived by the Director of Housing for good cause, to provide for the maintenance of the required housing on the sending lot for a minimum of 50 years. Such agreement shall commit to limits on rent and occupancy, consistent with the definition of housing TDR site, Landmark housing TDR site, or DMC housing TDR site, as applicable, and acceptable to the Director of Housing.
    4. For transfers of Landmark TDR or Landmark housing TDR, the owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement in form and content acceptable to the Landmarks Preservation Board providing for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the historically significant features of the structure or structures on the lot.
    5. For transfers of South Downtown Historic TDR, the owner of the sending lot shall execute and record an agreement in form and content acceptable to the Director of Neighborhoods in consultation with the International Special Review District Board or the Pioneer Square Preservation Board providing for the rehabilitation and maintenance of historically or architecturally significant features of a contributing structure or structures on the lot.
    6. A deed conveying TDR may require or permit the return of the TDR to the sending lot under specified conditions, but notwithstanding any such provisions:

        1. The transfer of TDR to a receiving lot shall remain effective so long as any portion of any structure for which a permit was issued based upon such transfer remains on the receiving lot; and
        2. The City shall not be required to recognize any return of TDR unless it is demonstrated that all parties in the chain of title have executed, acknowledged and recorded instruments conveying any interest in the TDR back to the sending lot and any lien holders have released any liens thereon.
    7. Any agreement governing the use or development of the sending lot shall provide that its covenants or conditions shall run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by The City of Seattle.
5. TDR sales before base FAR increases and changes in exemptions. Except for transfers of TDR from a sending lot with a major performing arts facility, or from a Landmark performing arts theater satisfying the conditions of subsection 23.49.011.A.3, transfers of TDR from any lot from which a TDR transfer was made prior to August 26, 2001, are limited to the amount of TDR available from such lot immediately prior to that date.
6. Projects developed under prior code provisions

    1. Any project that is developed pursuant to a master use permit issued under the provisions of this Title 23 as in effect prior to August 26, 2001, which permit provides for the use of TDR, may use TDR that were transferred from the sending lot consistent with such prior provisions prior to August 26, 2001.
    2. In addition or in the alternative, such a project may use TDR that are transferred from a sending lot on or after August 26, 2001.
    3. The use of TDR by any such project must be consistent with the provisions of Title 23 applicable to the project, including any limits on the range of FAR in which a type of TDR may be used, except that open space TDR may be used by such a project in lieu of any other TDR or any bonus, or both, allowable under such provisions.
7. TDR satisfying conditions to transfer under prior code

    1. If the conditions to transfer Landmark TDR, as in effect immediately prior to August 26, 2001, were satisfied on or before December 31, 2001, such TDR may be transferred from the sending lot in the amounts eligible for transfer as determined under the provisions of this Title 23 in effect immediately prior to August 26, 2001. If the conditions to transfer housing TDR were satisfied prior to August 26, 2001, under the provisions of this Title 23 then in effect, such TDR may be transferred from the sending lot in the amounts eligible for transfer immediately prior to that date. If the conditions to transfer TDR from a major performing arts facility were satisfied prior to August 26, 2001, under the provisions of this Title 23 then in effect, such TDR may be transferred from the sending lot after that date, for use on any receiving lots in zones where housing TDR may be used according to Table A for 23.49.014 or as provided in Section 23.50.053, in an amount as determined under subsection 23.49.014.B, provided that the cumulative amount of TDR that may be transferred after June 1, 2005, from any sending lot based on the presence of a major performing arts facility is limited to 150,000 square feet.
    2. For purposes of this subsection 23.49.014.G, conditions to transfer include, without limitations, the execution by the owner of the sending lot, and recording in the King County real property records, of any agreement required by the provisions of this Title 23 or the Public Benefit Features Rule in effect immediately prior to August 26, 2001, but such conditions do not include any requirement for a master use permit application for a project intending to use TDR, or any action connected with a receiving lot. TDR transferable under this subsection 23.49.014.G are eligible either for use consistent with the terms of Section 23.49.011 or for use by projects developed pursuant to permits issued under the provisions of this Title 23 in effect prior to August 26, 2001. The use of TDR transferred under this subsection 23.49.014.G on the receiving lot shall be subject only to those conditions and limits that apply for purposes of the master use permit decision for the project using the TDR.
8. Time of determination of TDR eligible for transfer. Except as stated in subsection 23.49.014.G, the eligibility of a sending lot to transfer TDR, and the amount transferable from a sending lot, shall be determined as of the date of transfer from the sending lot and shall not be affected by the date of any application, permit decision or other action for any project seeking to use such TDR.
9. Use of previously transferred TDR by new projects. Any project using TDR according to applicable limits on types and amounts of TDR in Section 23.49.011 may use TDR that were transferred from the sending lot consistent with the provisions of this Title 23 in effect at the time of such transfer. For purposes of this subsection 23.49.014.I, the owner of TDR that were transferred based upon a housing commitment accepted by the City shall be entitled to have such TDR considered as housing TDR.

##### 23.49.015 - Bonus residential floor area in DOC1, DOC2 and DMC zones outside South Downtown for voluntary agreements for low-income housing and moderate-income housing

1. General provisions

    1. The purpose of this Section 23.49.015 is to encourage residential development in addition to that authorized by basic zoning regulations ("bonus development"), provided that certain adverse impacts from the bonus development are mitigated. This Section 23.49.015 does not apply within South Downtown. "Basic zoning regulations" for purposes of this Section 23.49.015 are the provisions of Section 23.49.008 that determine base height limits for residential use in DOC1, DOC2 and DMC zones, and for DMC zones, the provisions of Section 23.49.058 that determine the maximum average floor area per story. The City has determined that one impact of high-rise residential development is an increased need for low-income housing and moderate-income housing to house the families of workers having lower paid jobs who serve the residents of such development. The City also finds that DOC1, DOC2, and DMC zones are areas in which increased residential development will assist in achieving local growth management and housing policies, and has determined that increased residential development capacity and height of residential structures can be achieved within these zones, subject to consideration of other regulatory controls on development. The City Council finds that in the case of affordable housing for rental occupancy, use of the income level for low-income housing rather than a lower level is necessary to address local housing market conditions, and that in the case of affordable housing for owner occupancy, higher income levels than those for low-income housing are needed to address local housing market conditions. The City hereby adopts the extension of the authority of RCW 36.70A.540, as amended, and enacts this Section 23.49.015 pursuant to such authority, in addition to the City's preexisting authority. To the extent that any provision of this Section 23.49.015 or the application thereof to any project for which a Master Use Permit application is considered under the Land Use Code as in effect after June 7, 2006 would conflict with any requirement of RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended, the terms of this Section 23.49.015 shall be deemed modified to conform to the applicable requirements of RCW 36.70A.540.
    2. An applicant may elect to seek bonus development under this section only for a project in a DOC1, DOC2 or DMC zone that includes residential development. If an applicant elects to seek approval of bonus development under this section, the applicant must execute a voluntary agreement with the City in which the applicant agrees to provide mitigation for impacts described in subsection A1 of this section. The mitigation may be provided in the form of low-income housing or moderate-income housing, or both, either within or adjacent to the residential project using the bonus development (the "performance option"), by paying the City to build or provide the housing (the "payment option"), or by a combination of the performance and payment options.
    3. No bonus development under this section shall be granted to any proposed development that would result in significant alteration to any designated feature of a Landmark structure unless a Certificate of Approval for the alteration is granted by the Landmarks Preservation Board.
    4. The Master Use Permit application to establish any bonus development under this Section 23.49.015 shall include a calculation of the amount of bonus development sought and shall identify the manner in which the conditions to such bonus development shall be satisfied. The Director shall, at the time of issuance of any Master Use Permit decision approving any such bonus development, issue a Type I decision as to the amount of bonus development to be allowed and the conditions to such bonus development, which decision may include alternative means to achieve bonus development, at the applicant's option, if each alternative would be consistent with this Section 23.49.015 and any other conditions of the permit, including Design Review conditions if applicable.
2. Voluntary agreements for housing

    1. The voluntary agreement shall commit the applicant to provide or contribute to low-income housing or moderate-income housing, or both, in an amount as set forth in this subsection 23.49.015.B. The quantities in this subsection 23.49.015.B are based on findings of an analysis that quantifies the linkages between new market-rate units in high-rise residential structures in DOC1, DOC2, and DMC zones and the demand that residents of such units generate for low-income housing and moderate-income housing. The amount of such housing and income levels served, and the amount of any cash payment, shall be determined as follows:

        1. For the performance option, the applicant shall provide, as low-income housing or moderate-income housing, net rentable floor area equal to 11 percent of the net residential floor area sought as bonus development, computed by multiplying the following sum by an efficiency factor of 80 percent: (i) the total square footage of gross residential floor area to be developed on the lot above the base height limit for residential use under Section 23.49.008, plus (ii) the excess, if any, in each tower to be developed on the lot, of (X) the total number of square feet of gross residential floor area between the height of 85 feet and the base height limit, over (Y) the product of the "average residential gross floor area limit of stories above 85 feet if height does not exceed the base height limit for residential use" as provided in Table B for 23.49.058, column 2, multiplied by the number of stories with residential use in each tower above 85 feet and below the base height limit. All low-income housing or moderate-income housing provided under the performance option shall be on the lot where the bonus development is used or an adjacent lot. The adjacent lot must be within the block where the bonus development is used and either abut the lot where bonus development is used, or be separated only by public right-of-way. All rental housing provided under the performance option shall be low-income housing.
        2. For the payment option, the applicant shall pay the lesser of the following:

            1. an amount that equals the approximate cost of developing the same number and quality of housing units that would be developed under the performance option, as determined by the Director; or
            2. (a) in DMC zones, $8.00 per square foot of gross residential floor area sought as bonus development between the height of 85 feet and the base height limit for residential use under Section 23.49.008, $12.00 per square foot of the gross residential floor area of the first four stories above the base height limit for residential use, $16.00 per square foot of gross residential floor area of the next three stories, and $20.00 per square foot of gross residential floor area of the higher stories, not to exceed an average of $15.15 per square foot of gross residential floor area sought as bonus development; and

                1. in DMC zones after the effective date of the ordinance introduced as Council Bill 117908, $11.45 per square foot of gross residential floor area sought as bonus development between the height of 85 feet and the base height limit for residential use under Section 23.49.008, $17.17 per square foot of the gross residential floor area of the first four stories above the base height limit for residential use, $22.89 per square foot of gross residential floor area of the next three stories, and $28.62 per square foot of gross residential floor area of the higher stories, not to exceed an average of $21.68 per square foot of gross residential floor area sought as bonus development; and
                2. in DOC1 and DOC2 zones, $15.15 per square foot of gross residential floor area sought as bonus development above the base height limit for residential use under Section 23.49.008.

                    1. in DOC1 and DOC2 zones after the effective date of the ordinance introduced as Council Bill 117908, $21.68 per square foot of gross residential floor area sought as bonus development above the base height limit for residential use under Section 23.49.008.
        3. The amount of the alternative cash contribution, as provided in this subsection 23.49.015.B.1.b and made at the time specified in subsection 23.49.015.C, shall be based on the amount that is in effect when vesting of a Master Use Permit occurs under 23.76.026. The full amount must be paid to the City in cash, except that if the City shall approve by ordinance the acceptance of specific real property in lieu of all or part of the cash payment, the Director of Housing may accept the real property.
    2. Each low-income housing unit provided as a condition to the bonus allowed under this section shall serve only households with incomes at or below eighty (80) percent of median income at the time of their initial occupancy. Each moderate-income housing unit provided as a condition to the bonus allowed under this section shall serve only as owner-occupied housing for households with incomes no higher than median income at the time of their initial occupancy. For rental housing, housing costs, including rent and basic utilities, shall not exceed thirty (30) percent of eighty (80) percent of median income, adjusted for the average size of family expected to occupy the unit based on the number of bedrooms, all as determined by the Housing Director, for a minimum period of fifty (50) years. For owner-occupied housing, the initial sale price shall not exceed an amount determined by the Housing Director to be consistent with affordable housing for a moderate-income household with the average family size expected to occupy the unit based on the number of bedrooms, and the units shall be subject to recorded instruments satisfactory to the Housing Director providing for sales prices on any resale consistent with affordability on the same basis. The Housing Director may promulgate rules specifying the method of determining affordability, including eligible monthly housing costs. The Housing Director may also promulgate rules for determining whether units satisfy the requirements of this section and any requirements relating to down-payment amount, design, quality, maintenance and condition of the low-income housing or moderate-income housing.
    3. For purposes of this section, housing may be considered to be provided by the applicant seeking bonus development under the performance option if the housing satisfies all of the following conditions:

        1. It is committed to serve an eligible income group, and for a time period, referred to in this section pursuant to an agreement between the housing owner and the City.
        2. The agreement required by subsection (i) is executed and recorded prior to the issuance of the master use permit to establish the use for the project using the bonus development, but except when subsection (iii)(B) below applies, no earlier than one (1) year prior to issuance of that master use permit.
        3. Either (A) the Certificate of Occupancy for the new low-income housing or moderate income housing, or both, must be issued within three (3) years of the date the Certificate of Occupancy is issued for the project using the bonus development, unless the Housing Director approves an extension based on delays that the applicant or housing developer could not reasonably have avoided, or (B) only in the case of low-income housing on a lot adjacent to the project using bonus development, which housing is subject to a regulatory agreement related to long-term City financing of low-income housing and was developed under a master use permit issued pursuant to a decision that considered the housing together with a project then proposed on that adjacent site, a final Certificate of Occupancy for the low-income housing was issued within five (5) years of the building permit issuance for the project proposed for bonus development on the adjacent lot.
        4. If the low-income housing or moderate-income housing is not owned by the applicant, then the applicant made a financial contribution to the low-income housing or moderate-income housing, or promised such contribution and has provided to the City an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit to ensure its payment, in form and content satisfactory to the Housing Director, in either case in an amount determined by the Housing Director to be, when reduced by the value of any expected benefits to be received for such contribution other than the bonus development, approximately equal to the cost of providing units within the project using the bonus development, and the owner of the low-income housing or moderate-income housing has entered into a linkage agreement with the applicant pursuant to which only the applicant has the right to claim such housing for purposes of bonus development under this section or any other bonus under this title.
    4. Any applicant seeking to qualify for bonus floor area based on development of new housing shall provide to the City, prior to the date when a contribution would be due for the cash option under subsection C of this section, an irrevocable bank letter of credit or other sufficient security approved by the Director of the Office of Housing, and a related voluntary agreement, so that at the end of the three (3) year period specified in subsection B3 of this section, if the housing does not qualify or is not provided in a sufficient amount to satisfy the terms of this section, the City shall receive (i) a cash contribution for housing in the amount determined pursuant to this section after credit for any qualifying housing then provided, plus (ii) an amount equal to interest on such contribution, at the rate equal to the prime rate quoted from time to time by Bank of America, or its successor, plus three (3) percent per annum, from the date of issuance of the first building permit for the project using the bonus. If and when the City becomes entitled to realize on any such security, the Director of the Office of Housing shall take appropriate steps to do so, and the amounts realized, net of any costs to the City, shall be used in the same manner as cash contributions for housing made under this section. In the case of any project proposing to use bonus development for which no building permit is required, references to the building permit in this subsection shall mean the master use permit allowing establishment or expansion of the use for which bonus development is sought.
    5. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to confer on any owner or developer of housing, any party to a linkage agreement, or any assignee, any development rights or property interests. Because the availability and terms of allowance of bonus development depend upon the regulations in effect at the relevant time for the project proposing to use such bonus development, pursuant to SMC Section 23.76.026, any approvals or agreements by the Director of the Office of Housing regarding the eligibility of actual or proposed housing as to satisfy conditions of a bonus, and any approval of a linkage agreement and/or assignment, do not grant any vested rights, nor guarantee that any bonus development will be permitted based on such housing.
    6. The Director of the Office of Housing is authorized to accept and execute agreements and instruments to implement this section. For the performance option, the voluntary agreement by the applicant or, if the applicant is not the housing owner, then a recorded agreement of the housing owner acceptable to the Housing Director, shall provide for an initial monitoring fee payable to the City of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) per unit of low-income housing or moderate-income housing provided, and in the case of rental housing, an annual monitoring fee payable to the City of Sixty-five Dollars ($65) for each such unit. For rental housing, such agreement also shall require the housing owner to submit to the City annual reports with such information as the Housing Director shall require for monitoring purposes. In the case of housing for owner-occupancy, the recorded resale restrictions also shall include a provision requiring payment to the City, on any sale or other transfer, of a fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500) for the review and processing of transfer documents to determine compliance with income and affordability restrictions.
    7. If the Housing Director shall certify to the Director that the Housing Director has accepted and there have been recorded one or more agreements or instruments satisfactory to the Housing Director providing for occupancy and affordability restrictions on housing provided for purposes of the performance option under this section, and that either all affordable housing has been completed or the applicant has provided the City with an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit satisfactory to the Housing Director in the amount of the contribution to the affordable housing approved by the Housing Director, if applicable, then any failure of such housing to satisfy the requirements of this subsection B shall not affect the right to maintain or occupy the bonus development. Unless and until the Housing Director shall so certify, it shall be a continuing permit condition, whether or not expressly stated, for each project obtaining bonus floor area based on the provision of housing under this subsection, that the low-income or moderate-income housing units, or both, as applicable, shall continue to satisfy the requirements of this subsection throughout the term specified in this section and that such compliance shall be documented to the satisfaction of the Director of the Office of Housing. The Director of the Office of Housing may provide by rule for circumstances in which low-income or moderate-income housing units, or both, as applicable, may be replaced if lost due to casualty or other causes, and for terms and conditions upon which a cash contribution may be made in lieu of continuing to provide low-income housing or moderate-income housing, or both, under the terms of this subsection.
    8. Housing units produced with voluntary contributions made under this section, shall include a range of unit sizes, including units suitable for families with children. Housing units provided to qualify for bonus development shall comply with the following: (i) they shall be provided in a range of sizes comparable to those available to other residents; (ii) to the extent practicable, the number of bedrooms in low-income units and moderate-income units must be in the same proportion as the number of bedrooms in units within the entire building; (iii) the low-income units and moderate-income units shall generally be distributed throughout the building, except that they may be provided in an adjacent building; and (iv) the low-income units and moderate-income units shall have substantially the same functionality as the other units in the building or buildings. The Housing Director is authorized to prescribe by rule standards and procedures for determining compliance with the requirements of this subsection 8. The Housing Director is further authorized to adopt policies for distribution of unit sizes in housing developments funded by contributions received under this section.
    9. References in this subsection B to a Certificate of Occupancy for a project mean the first Certificate of Occupancy issued by the City for the project, whether temporary or permanent.
3. Cash Option Payments.

    1. On July 1, 2014 and on the same day annually thereafter the alternative cash contribution amount in subsection 23.49.015.B.1.b shall automatically adjust in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index, from December 31, 2013 or the time the alternative cash contribution was last adjusted, whichever is later.
    2. Cash payments under voluntary agreements for bonuses shall be made prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of any building permit after the first building permit for a project, and in any event before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued, unless the applicant elects in writing to defer payment. If the applicant elects to defer payment, then the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for the project shall be conditioned upon payment of the full amount of the cash payment determined under this Section, plus an interest factor equal to that amount multiplied by the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, West Region, All Items, 1962-64=100, as published monthly, from the last month prior to the date when payment would have been required if deferred payment had not been elected, to the last month for which data are available at the time of payment. If the index specified in this subsection is not available for any reason, the Director shall select a substitute cost of living index. In no case shall the interest factor be less than zero (0). All payments under this Section shall be deposited in special accounts established solely to fund capital expenditures for the affordable housing for low-income households.
4. No Subsidies for Bonused Housing: Exception.

    1. Intent. Housing provided through the bonus system is intended to mitigate a portion of the additional low-income housing needs resulting from increased high-rise market rate housing development, beyond those needs that would otherwise exist, which the City and other governmental and charitable entities attempt to meet through various subsidy programs. Allowing bonus development under the performance option for housing that uses such subsidy programs therefore could undermine the intent of this section.
    2. Agreement Concerning Subsidies. The Director of the Office of Housing may require, as a condition of any bonus floor area for housing under the performance option, that the owner of the lot upon which the low-income housing is located agree not to seek or accept any subsidies, including without limitation those items referred to in subsection D3 of this section, related to the housing, except for any subsidies that may be allowed by the Director of the Office of Housing under that subsection. The Housing Director may require that such agreement provide for the payment to the City, for deposit in an appropriate account to be used for Downtown low-income housing, of the value of any subsidies received in excess of any amounts allowed by such agreement.
    3. No Bonus for Subsidized or Restricted Housing. In general, no bonus may be earned by providing housing if:

        1. Any person is receiving or will receive with respect to the housing any charitable contributions or public subsidies for housing development or operation, including, but not limited to, tax exempt bond financing, tax credits, federal loans or grants, City of Seattle housing loans or grants, county housing funds, State of Washington housing funds, or property tax exemptions or other special tax treatment; or
        2. The housing is or would be, independent of the requirements for the bonus, subject to any restrictions on the use, occupancy or rents.
    4. Exceptions by Rule. The Director of the Office of Housing may provide, by rule promulgated after the effective date of this ordinance, for terms and conditions on which exceptions to the restriction on subsidies in this subsection may be allowed. Such rule may provide that, as a condition to any exception, the Director of the Office of Housing shall increase the amount of floor area of low-income housing or moderate-income housing per square foot of bonus development, otherwise determined pursuant to subsection B of this section, to an amount that allows credit for only the Director's estimate of the incremental effect, in meeting the City's housing needs for the next fifty (50) years, of the net financial contribution that is being made by the applicant pursuant to the voluntary agreement and not funded or reimbursed, directly or indirectly, from any other source.

##### 23.49.016 - Open space.

1. Finding. The City Council finds that:

    1. Office workers are the principal users of Downtown open space.
    2. Additional major office projects Downtown will result in increased use of public open space.
    3. If additional major office projects Downtown do not provide open space to offset the additional demands on public open space caused by such projects, the result will be overcrowding of public open space, adversely affecting the public health, safety and welfare.
    4. The additional open space needed to accommodate office workers is at least twenty (20) square feet for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of office space.
    5. Smaller office developments may encounter design problems in incorporating open space, and the sizes of open spaces provided for office projects under eighty-five thousand (85,000) square feet may make them less attractive and less likely to be used. Therefore, and in order not to discourage small scale office development, projects involving less than eighty-five thousand (85,000) square feet of new office space should be exempt from any open space requirement.
    6. As indicated in the October 1994 report of the Department of Construction and land use, with the exception of certain projects, most major recent Downtown office projects have provided significant amounts of on-site open space. Therefore, requiring open space for future major projects will tend to ensure that existing projects do not bear the burdens caused by new development and will result in an average reciprocity of advantage.
2. Quantity of Open Space. Open space in the amount of twenty (20) square feet for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of gross office floor area shall be required of projects that include eighty-five thousand (85,000) or more square feet of gross office floor area in DOC1, DOC2, DMC, DMR/C and DH2 zones, except that the floor area of a museum expansion space, satisfying the provisions of Section 23.49.011 B1h, shall be excluded from the calculation of gross office floor area.
3. Standards for Open Space. To satisfy this requirement, open space may be provided on-site or off-site, as follows:

    1. Private Open Space. Private open space on the project site or on an adjacent lot directly accessible from the project site may satisfy the requirement of this section. Such space shall not be eligible for bonuses. Private open space shall be open to the sky and shall be consistent with the general conditions related to landscaping; seating and furnishings contained in the Downtown Amenity Standards. Private open space satisfying this requirement must be accessible to all tenants of the building and their employees.
    2. On-site Public Open Space.

        1. Open space provided on the project site under this requirement shall be eligible for amenity feature bonuses, as allowed for each zone, provided the open space is open to the public without charge and meets the standards of Section 23.49.013 and the Downtown Amenity Standards for one (1) or more of the following:

        • Parcel park;

        • Green street setback and green street improvement on an abutting right-of-way;

        • Hillside terrace;

        • Harborfront open space; or

        • Urban plaza.

        2. On-site open space satisfying the requirement of subsection C2a of this section may achieve a bonus as an amenity feature not to exceed any limits pursuant to Section 23.49.013, subject to the conditions in this chapter, which bonus shall be counted against, and not increase, the total FAR bonus available from the provision of amenity features.
    3. Off-site Public Open Space.

        1. Open space satisfying the requirement of this section may be on a site other than the project site, provided that it is within a Downtown zone, within one-quarter (¼) mile of the project site, open to the public without charge, and at least five thousand (5,000) square feet in contiguous area. The minimum size of off-site open space and maximum distance from the project may be increased or decreased for a project if the Director determines that such adjustments are reasonably necessary to provide for open space that will meet the additional need for open space caused by the project and enhance public access.
        2. Public open space provided on a site other than the project site may qualify for a development bonus for the project if the open space meets the standards of Section 23.49.013 and is one of the open space features citied in subsection C2a of this section. Bonus ratios for off-site open space are prescribed in Section 23.49.013. This bonus is counted against, and may not increase, the total amount of bonus development allowed under Section 23.49.011 and Section 23.49.013.
    4. Easement for Off-site Open Space. The owner of any lot on which off-site open space is provided to meet the requirements of this section shall execute and record an easement in a form acceptable to the Director assuring compliance with the requirements of this section, including applicable conditions of the Downtown Amenity Standards. The Director is authorized to accept such an easement, provided that the terms do not impose any costs or obligations on the City.
4. Payment in Lieu. In lieu of providing open space under this requirement, an owner may make a payment to the City if the Director determines that the payment will contribute to the improvement of a designated green street or to other public open space improvements abutting the lot or in the vicinity, in an amount sufficient to develop improvements that will meet the additional need for open space caused by the project, and that the improvement within a reasonable time is feasible. Any such payment shall be placed in a dedicated fund or account and used within five (5) years of receipt for the development of such improvements, unless the property owner and the City agree upon another use involving the acquisition or development of public open space that will mitigate the impact of the project. A bonus may be allowed for a payment in lieu of providing improvement made wholly or in part to satisfy the requirements of this section, pursuant to Section 23.49.013.
5. Limitations. Open space satisfying the requirement of this section for any project shall not be used to satisfy the open space requirement for any other project, nor shall any bonus be granted to any project for open space meeting the requirement of this section for any other project. When a transmitting antenna is sited or proposed to be sited on a rooftop where required open space is located, see Section 23.57.013. Open space on the site of any building for which a Master Use Permit decision was issued or a complete building permit application was filed prior to the effective date ordinance 117430, that is not required under the Land Use Code in effect when such permit decision was issued or such application filed but that would have been required for the same building by this section, shall not be used to satisfy the open space requirement or to gain an FAR bonus for any other project.
6. Authority. This section is adopted pursuant to the Growth Management Act, the City's Comprehensive Plan and the City's inherent police power authority. The City Council finds that the requirements of this section are necessary to protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare.

##### 23.49.017 - Open space TDR Site Eligibility

1. Intent. The intent of open space TDR is to provide opportunities for establishing a variety of usable public open space generally distributed to serve all areas of downtown.
2. Application and Approval. The owner of a lot who wants to establish and convey open space TDR shall apply to the Director for approval of the lot as a sending lot for open space TDR. The application shall include a design for the open space in such detail as the Director shall require and a maintenance plan for the open space. The Director shall review the application pursuant to the provisions of this section, and shall approve, disapprove or conditionally approve the application to establish and convey open space TDR. Conditions may include, without limitation, assurance of funding for long-term maintenance of the open space and dates when approvals shall expire if the open space is not developed.
3. Area Eligible for Transfer. For purposes of calculating the amount of TDR transferable under Section 23.49.014, Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), eligible area does not include any portion of the lot occupied above grade by a structure or use unless the structure or use is accessory to the open space.
4. Basic requirements. In order to qualify as a sending lot for open space TDR, the sending lot must include open space that satisfies the basic requirements of this subsection, unless an exception is granted by the Director pursuant to subsection 23.49.017.H. A sending lot for open space TDR must:

    1. Include a minimum area as follows:

        1. Contiguous open space with a minimum area of 15,000 square feet; or
        2. A network of adjacent open spaces, which may be separated by a street right-of-way, that are physically and visually connected with a minimum area of 30,000 square feet;
    2. Be directly accessible from the sidewalk or another public open space, including access for persons with disabilities;
    3. Be at ground level, except that in order to provide level open spaces on steep lots, some separation of multiple levels may be allowed, provided they are physically and visually connected;
    4. Not have more than 20 percent of the lot area occupied by any above grade structures; and
    5. Be located a minimum of ¼ of a mile from the closest lot approved by the Director as a separate open space TDR site.
5. Open Space Guidelines. The Director shall consider the following guidelines, and may disapprove or condition an application based on one or more of them. If the Director determines that the design for the open space will substantially satisfy the intent of the guidelines as a whole, the Director need not require that every guideline be satisfied as a condition to approval. Open space should be designed to:

    1. Be well integrated with Downtown's pedestrian and transit network;
    2. Be oriented to promote access to sun and views and protection from wind, taking into account potential development on adjacent lots built to the maximum limits zoning allows;
    3. Enhance user safety and security and ease of maintenance;
    4. Be highly visible because of the relation to the street grid, topographic conditions, surrounding development pattern, or other factors, thereby enhancing public access and identification of the space as a significant component of the urban landscape;
    5. Incorporate various features, such as seating and access to food service, that are appropriate to the type of area and that will enhance public use of the area as provided by the guidelines for an urban plaza in the Downtown Amenity Standards;
    6. Provide such ingress and egress as will make the areas easily accessible to the general public along street perimeters;
    7. Be aesthetically pleasing space that is well integrated with the surrounding area through landscaping and special elements, which should establish an identity for the space while providing for the comfort of those using it;
    8. Increase activity and comfort while maintaining the overall open character of public outdoor space; and
    9. Include artwork as an integral part of the design of the public space.
6. Public Access.

    1. Recorded Documents. The open space must be subject to a recorded easement, or other instrument acceptable to the Director, to limit any future development on the lot and to ensure general public access and the preservation and maintenance of the open space, unless such requirement is waived by the Director for open space in public ownership. The Director is authorized to accept such an easement or instrument, so long as its terms do not impose obligations or costs on the City.
    2. Hours of Operation. The open space must be open to the general public without charge for reasonable and predictable hours, such as those for a public park, for a minimum of ten (10) hours each day of every week. Within the open space, property owners, tenants and their agents shall allow individuals to engage in activities allowed in public parks of a similar nature. Free speech activities such as hand billing, signature gathering and holding signs, all without obstructing access to the open space, or adjacent buildings or features, and without unreasonably interfering with the enjoyment of the space by others, shall be allowed. While engaged in allowed activities members of the public may not be asked to leave for any reason other than conduct that unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the space by others.
    3. Plaque Requirement. A plaque indicating the nature of the site and its availability for general public access must be placed in a visible location at the entrances to the site. The text on the plaque is subject to the approval of the Director.
7. Maintenance. The property owner and/or another responsible party who shall have assumed obligations for maintenance on terms approved by the Director, shall maintain all elements of the site, including but not limited to landscaping, parking, seating and lighting, in a safe and clean condition as provided for in a maintenance plan to be approved by the Director.
8. Special exception for Open Space TDR sites. The Director may authorize an exception to the requirements for open space TDR sites in subsection 23.49.017.D, as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permit and Council Land Use Decisions.

    1. The provisions of this subsection 23.49.017.H will be used by the Director in determining whether to grant, grant with condition or deny a special exception. The Director may grant exceptions only to the extent such exceptions further the provisions of this subsection 23.49.017.H.
    2. In order for the Director to grant, or grant with conditions, an exception to the requirements for open space TDR sites, the following must be satisfied:

        1. The exception allows the design of the open space to take advantage of unusual site characteristics or conditions in the surrounding area, such as views and relationship to surroundings; and
        2. The applicant demonstrates that the exceptions would result in an open space that better meets the intent of the provisions for open space TDR sites in subsection 23.49.017.D.

##### 23.49.018 - Overhead Weather Protection and Lighting.

1. Continuous overhead weather protection shall be required for new development along the entire street frontage of a lot except along those portions of the structure facade that:

    1. are located farther than five (5) feet from the street property line or widened sidewalk on private property; or
    2. abut a bonused open space amenity feature; or
    3. are separated from the street property line or widened sidewalk on private property by a landscaped area at least two (2) feet in width; or
    4. are driveways into structures or loading docks.
2. Overhead weather protection shall have a minimum dimension of eight (8) feet measured horizontally from the building wall or must extend to a line two (2) feet from the curb line, whichever is less.
3. The installation of overhead weather protection shall not result in any obstructions in the sidewalk area.
4. The lower edge of the overhead weather protection must be a minimum of ten (10) feet and a maximum of fifteen (15) feet above the sidewalk.
5. Adequate lighting for pedestrians shall be provided. The lighting may be located on the facade of the building or on the overhead weather protection.

##### 23.49.019 - Parking quantity, location, and access requirements and screening and landscaping of parking areas

The regulations in this Section 23.49.019 do not apply to the Pike Market Mixed zones.


1. Parking quantity requirements

    1. No parking, either long-term or short-term, is required for uses on lots in Downtown zones, except as follows:

        1. In the International District Mixed and International District Residential zones, parking requirements for restaurants, motion picture theaters, and other entertainment uses are as prescribed by Section 23.66.342.
        2. In the International District Mixed and International District Residential zones, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods, upon the recommendation of the International District Special Review District Board may waive or reduce required parking according to the provisions of Section 23.66.342, Parking and access.
        3. Bicycle parking is required as specified in subsection 23.49.019.E.1.
    2. Reduction or elimination of parking required by permits. A property owner may apply to the Director for the reduction or elimination of parking required by any permit issued under this Title 23 or Title 24, except for a condition contained in or required pursuant to any Council conditional use, contract rezone, planned community development or other Type IV decision. The Director may grant reduction or elimination of required parking as a Type I decision, either as part of a Master Use Permit for the establishment of any new use or structure, or as an independent application for reduction or elimination of parking required by permit. Parking for bicycles may not be reduced or eliminated under this subsection 23.49.019.A.2. Any Transportation Management Plan (TMP) required by permit for the development for which a parking reduction or elimination is proposed shall remain in effect, except that the Director may change the conditions of the TMP to reflect current conditions and to mitigate any parking and traffic impacts of the proposed changes. If any bonus floor area was granted for the parking, then reduction or elimination shall not be permitted except in compliance with applicable provisions regarding the elimination or reduction of bonus features. If any required parking that is allowed to be reduced or eliminated under this subsection 23.49.019.A.2 is the subject of a recorded parking covenant, the Director may authorize modification or release of the covenant.
2. Parking location within structures

    1. Parking at street level

        1. On Class I pedestrian streets and designated green streets, parking is not permitted at street level unless separated from the street by other uses, provided that garage doors need not be separated.
        2. On Class II pedestrian streets, parking may be permitted at street level if:

            1. at least 30 percent of the street frontage of any street-level parking area, excluding that portion of the frontage occupied by garage doors, is separated from the street by other uses;
            2. the facade of the separating uses satisfies the transparency and blank wall standards for Class I pedestrian streets for the zone in which the structure is located;
            3. the portion of the parking, excluding garage doors, that is not separated from the street by other uses is screened from view at street level; and
            4. the street facade is enhanced by architectural detailing, artwork, landscaping, or similar visual interest features.
    2. Limits on the number of stories of parking located above the street-level story

        1. There is no limit on the number of stories of parking permitted above the street-level story if the parking is separated along all street frontages of the structure by another use and if the separation requirements of subsection 23.49.019.B.3 are met.
        2. On lots that are less than 30,000 square feet in size, or that are 150 feet in depth or less as measured from the lot line with the greatest street frontage, parking is permitted above the street-level story as follows:

            1. One story of parking is permitted above the street-level story of the structure for each story of parking provided below grade that is of at least equivalent capacity, up to a maximum of four stories of parking above the street-level story. The separation requirements of subsection 23.49.019.B.3 and the screening requirements of subsection 23.49.019.B.4 must be met.
            2. The Director may permit more than four stories of parking above the street-level story of the structure or may permit other exceptions to subsection 23.49.019.B.2.b.1 as a Type I decision if the Director finds that locating parking below grade is infeasible due to physical site conditions such as a high water table or proximity to a tunnel. In such cases, the applicant shall place the maximum feasible amount of parking below grade before more than four stories of parking above the street-level story shall be permitted. The rationale that a site is too small to accommodate parking below grade is not a basis for granting an exception under this subsection 23.49.019.B.2.b.2.
    3. Separation of parking located above the street-level story

        1. All parking provided above the street-level story of a structure shall be separated along all street lot lines by another use, except for lots that meet the conditions of subsection 23.49.019.B.2.b, which are subject to the provisions of subsections 23.49.019.B.3.b and 23.49.019.B.3.c.
        2. Except as provided in subsection 23.49.019.B.3.c, for parking that is allowed above the street-level story under the provisions of subsection 23.49.019.B.2.b, parking above the third story of a structure shall be separated from the street by another use for a minimum of 30 percent measured along each street frontage of the structure. For structures located at street intersections, the separation by another use shall be provided at the corner portion(s) of the structure.
        3. Separation of parking on blocks abutting Alaskan Way in the DMC 160 zone

            1. Any parking located above the street-level story of a structure shall be separated along 100 percent of the street frontage facing Alaskan Way by one or more of the following uses:

                1. residential use that is predominantly floor area occupied by dwelling units or common recreation area;
                2. lodging rooms or public areas accessory to hotel use;
                3. office use; or
                4. uses that qualify as required street-level uses in subsection 23.49.009.A.
            2. Any parking located above the street-level story of a structure facing other streets besides Alaskan Way shall be separated from those streets by another use for a minimum of 30 percent measured along each street frontage. For structures located at street intersections, the separation by another use shall be provided at the corner portion(s) of the structure.
    4. Screening of parking located above the street-level story. For parking that is allowed above the street-level story under the provisions of subsection 23.49.019.B.2.b, if parking is not separated from the street by another use, then screening of the parking is required as follows:

        1. Except as provided in subsection 23.49.019.B.4.b, the perimeter of each story of parking above the street-level story of the structure shall have an opaque screen at least 3.5 feet high where the parking is not separated from the street by another use.
        2. In the DMC 160 zone, on street frontages where parking is not separated from the street by another use, parking shall be enclosed by facades. The facades shall be designed to minimize the visual impacts and impacts of glare from vehicle headlights and interior garage lighting.
3. Maximum parking limit for non-residential uses

    1. Except as provided in subsections 23.49.019.C.2, 23.49.019.C.3, and 23.66.342.B, parking for non-residential uses is limited to a maximum of one parking space per 1,000 square feet.
    2. Parking for non-residential uses in excess of the maximum quantities identified in subsections 23.49.019.C.1 and 23.49.019.C.3 may be permitted as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76. When deciding whether to grant a special exception, the Director shall consider evidence of parking demand and alternative means of transportation, including but not limited to the following:

        1. Whether the additional parking will substantially encourage the use of single occupancy vehicles;
        2. Characteristics of the work force and employee hours, such as multiple shifts that end when transit service is not readily available;
        3. Proximity of transit lines to the lot and headway times of those lines;
        4. The need for a motor pool or large number of fleet vehicles at the site;
        5. Proximity to existing long-term parking opportunities downtown which might eliminate the need for additional parking on the lot;
        6. Whether the additional parking will adversely affect vehicular and pedestrian circulation in the area;
        7. Potential for shared use of additional parking as residential or short-term parking;
        8. The need for additional short-term parking to support shopping in the retail core or retail activity in other areas where short-term parking is limited;
        9. Whether the area is located at the edge of the Downtown Urban Center where available short-term parking and transit service is limited.
    3. In the area east of Interstate 5, parking for general sales and service uses and for eating and drinking establishments is limited to a maximum of two parking spaces per 1,000 square feet.
4. Ridesharing and transit incentive program requirements. The following requirements apply to all new structures containing more than 10,000 square feet of new non-residential use, and to structures where more than 10,000 square feet of non-residential use is proposed to be added.

    1. The building owner shall establish and maintain a transportation coordinator position for the proposed structure and designate a person to fill this position, or the building owner may contract with an area-wide transportation coordinator acceptable to the Department.

The transportation coordinator in addition shall survey all employees of building tenants once a year to determine commute mode percentages.
    2. The Seattle Department of Transportation, in conjunction with the transportation coordinator, shall monitor the effectiveness of the ridesharing/transit incentive program on an annual basis. The building owner shall allow a designated Seattle Department of Transportation or rideshare representative to inspect the parking facility and review operation of the ridesharing program.
    3. The building owner shall provide and maintain a transportation information center, which has transit information displays including transit route maps and schedules and Seattle ridesharing program information. The transportation display shall be located in the lobby or other location highly visible to employees within the structure, and shall be established prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
5. Bicycle parking

    1. The minimum number of off-street spaces for bicycle parking required for specific use categories is set forth in Table A for 23.49.019 below. In the case of a use not shown on Table A for 23.49.019, there is no minimum bicycle parking requirement. After the first 50 spaces for bicycles are provided for a use, additional spaces are required at 0.5 times the ratio shown in Table A for 23.49.019. Spaces within dwelling units or on balconies do not count toward the bicycle parking requirement.

1. Required bicycle parking shall be provided in a safe, accessible and convenient location. Bicycle parking hardware shall be installed according to its manufacturer's instructions, and the Seattle Department of Transportation design criteria, allowing adequate clearance for bicycles and their riders. Directional signage shall be installed if bicycle parking facilities are not clearly visible from the street or sidewalk. If any covered automobile parking is provided, all required long-term bicycle parking shall be covered. If located off-street, bicycle and automobile parking areas shall be separated by a barrier or painted lines.

4. Co-location of bicycle parking facilities by more than one use is encouraged.
5. For non-residential uses, the applicant may make a payment to the City to fund public bicycle parking in the public right-of-way in lieu of providing required bicycle parking on- or off-site, if the Director determines that:

    1. Safe, accessible and convenient bicycle parking accessory to a non-residential use cannot be provided on-site or in a shared bicycle parking facility within 100 feet of the lot, without extraordinary physical or financial difficulty;
    2. The payment is comparable to the cost of providing the equivalent bicycle parking on-site, and takes in consideration the cost of materials, equipment and labor for installation; and
    3. The bicycle parking funded by the payment is located within sufficient proximity to serve the bicycle parking demand generated by the project.
    4. Any such payment shall be placed in a dedicated fund or account and used within five years of receipt to provide the bicycle parking.
6. Bicycle commuter shower facilities. Structures containing 250,000 square feet or more of office gross floor area shall include shower facilities and clothing storage areas for bicycle commuters. One shower per gender shall be required for every 250,000 square feet of office use. Such facilities shall be for the use of the employees and occupants of the building, and shall be located where they are easily accessible to parking facilities for bicycles.
7. Off-street loading

    1. Off-street loading spaces shall be provided according to the standards of Section 23.54.035, Loading berth requirements and space standards.

    1. Curb cut location

        1. If a lot abuts an alley, alley access is required, except as provided in subsection 23.49.019.H.1.c.
        2. If a lot does not abut an alley and abuts more than one right-of-way, the location of access is determined by the Director as a Type I decision after consulting with the Director of Transportation. Unless the Director otherwise determines under subsection 23.49.019.H.1.c, access is allowed only from a right-of-way in the category, determined by the classifications shown on Map 1B and Map 1F or another map identified in a note to Map 1F, that is most preferred among the categories of rights-of-way abutting the lot, according to the ranking set forth below, from most to least preferred (a portion of a street that is included in more than one category is considered as belonging only to the least preferred of the categories in which it is included):

            1. Access street;
            2. Class II pedestrian street/Minor arterial;
            3. Class II pedestrian street/Principal arterial;

The Director may allow or require access from a right-of-way other than one indicated by subsection 23.49.019.H.1.a or 23.49.019.H.1.b if, after consulting with the Director of Transportation on whether and to what extent alternative locations of access would enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, facilitate transit operations, facilitate the movement of vehicles, minimize the on-street queuing of vehicles, enhance vehicular safety, or minimize hazards, and, for hotel use, improve passenger loading safety or increase visibility of vehicular access for guests arriving by car, the Director finds that an exception to the general policy is warranted. The Director may approve an exception for hotel use and impose conditions to minimize any adverse impacts to the pedestrian environment or street operations, including but not limited to allowing one-way driveways that are less than the minimum width otherwise required. Curb cut controls on designated green streets shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but generally access from green streets is not allowed if access from any other right-of-way is possible.
    2. Curb cut width and number. The width and number of curbcuts shall comply with Section 23.54.030, Parking space standards.

##### 23.49.020 - Demonstration of LEED Silver rating

where:


P is the penalty;

LSM is the minimum number of credits to earn a LEED Silver rating;

CE is the number of credits earned as documented by the report; and

CV is the Construction Value as set forth on the building permit for the new structure.

Example:


<table>
<tr>
<td>Construction Value</td>
<td>$200,000,000.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Minimum LEED Credits for Silver rating</td>
<td>33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Credits Earned</td>
<td>32</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Penalty = [(33-32)/33] × 200,000,000 × .0075 =</td>
<td>$45,454.55</td>
</tr>
</table>


1. Failure to comply with the applicant's commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating is a violation of the Land Use Code independent of the failure to demonstrate compliance; however, such violation shall not affect the right to occupy any chargeable floor area, and if a penalty is paid in the amount determined under subsection 23.49.020.C.3, no additional penalty shall be imposed for the failure to comply with the commitment.
2. If the Director determines that the report submitted provides satisfactory evidence that the applicant's commitment is satisfied, the Director shall issue a certificate to the applicant so stating. If the Director determines that the applicant did not demonstrate compliance with its commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating in accordance with this section, the Director may give notice of such determination, and of the calculation of the penalty due, to the applicant.
3. If, within 90 days, or such longer period as the Director may allow for good cause, after initial notice from the Director of a penalty due under this subsection 23.49.020.C, the applicant shall demonstrate, through a supplemental report from the independent entity that provided the initial report, that it has made sufficient alterations or improvements to earn a LEED Silver rating, or to earn more credits toward such a rating, then the penalty owing shall be eliminated or recalculated accordingly. The amount of the penalty as so re-determined shall be final. If the applicant does not submit a supplemental report in accordance with this subsection 23.49.020.C by the date required under this subsection 23.49.020.C, then the amount of the penalty as set forth in the Director's original notice shall be final.
4. Any owner, other than the applicant, of any lot on which the bonus development was obtained or any part thereof, shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance and liable for any penalty due under this subsection 23.49.020.C.

1. Applicability. This section applies if a commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating or substantially equivalent standard is a condition of a permit.
2. The Director is authorized to determine, as a Type I decision, whether the applicant has demonstrated that a new structure has earned a LEED Silver rating or met a substantially equivalent standard. The Director may establish by rule procedures for determining whether an applicant has demonstrated that a new structure has earned a LEED Silver rating or met any such substantially equivalent standard, provided that no rule shall assign authority for making a final determination to any person other than an officer of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections or another City agency with regulatory authority and expertise in green building practices.
3. Demonstration of Compliance; Penalties.

P = [(LSM-CE)/LSM] × CV × 0.0075,


    1. The applicant shall demonstrate to the Director the extent to which the applicant has complied with the commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating no later than 180 days after issuance of final Certificate of Occupancy for the new structure, or such later date as may be allowed by the Director for good cause, by submitting a report analyzing the extent credits were earned toward such rating from the U.S. Green Building Council or another independent entity approved by the Director. For purposes of this Section 23.49.020, if the Director has approved a substantially equivalent standard, the term "LEED Silver rating" shall mean such other standard.
    2. Failure to submit a timely report regarding a LEED Silver rating from an approved independent entity by the date required is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for such violation is $500 per day from the date that the report was due to the date it is submitted. The owner is subject to this fine regardless of whether the City provides the owner with notice that the report is overdue or that the fine is accruing.
    3. Failure to demonstrate, through an independent report as provided in this subsection, full compliance with the applicant's commitment to earn a LEED Silver rating, is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for each violation is an amount determined as follows:
4. Use of Penalties. A subfund shall be established in the City's General Fund to receive revenue from penalties under subsection 23.49.020.C. Revenue from penalties under that subsection shall be allocated to activities or incentives to encourage and promote the development of sustainable buildings. The Director shall recommend to the Mayor and City Council how these funds should be allocated.

##### 23.49.021 - Transportation concurrency level-of-service standards.

Proposed uses in downtown zones shall meet the transportation concurrency level-of-service standards prescribed in Chapter 23.52.


##### 23.49.022 - Minimum sidewalk and alley width.

1. Minimum sidewalk widths are established for certain streets by Map 1C.

    1. If a new structure is proposed on lots abutting these streets, sidewalks shall be widened, if necessary, to meet the minimum standard. The sidewalk may be widened into the right-of-way if approved by the Director of Transportation.
    2. Sidewalk widths for certain streets within PMM, PSM, IDM, and IDR zones are addressed by Special Review or Historic District regulations. On a street within the International Special Review District for which a sidewalk width is designated on Map 1C, the minimum sidewalk width identified by Map 1C may be reduced if it is determined that a reduced sidewalk width would better meet the goals and objectives of the International Special Review District identified in Section 23.66.302. Final approval for the reduced sidewalk width will be made by the Director of Transportation upon recommendation by the Director of Neighborhoods.
2. A setback or dedication may be required in order to meet the provisions of Section 23.53.030, Alley improvements in all zones.

##### 23.49.031 - Green Factor Landscaping in South Downtown

In South Downtown, a lot on which there is new construction of 20,000 square feet or more in gross floor area shall meet a minimum Green Factor score of 0.30, calculated pursuant to Section 23.86.019, except that the Green Factor requirement may be modified by the Director, as a Type I decision, in consultation with the Director of Neighborhoods if the Director determines that the requirement would adversely affect historically or architecturally significant features of a contributing structure.


##### 23.49.032 - Additions of chargeable floor area to lots with existing structures.

1. When development is proposed on a lot that will retain existing structures containing chargeable floor area in excess of the applicable base FAR, additional chargeable floor area may be added to the lot up to the maximum permitted FAR, by qualifying for bonuses or using TDR, or both, and by the use of rural development credits if permitted on such lot, subject to the general rules for FAR and use of bonuses, TDR, and rural development credits, SMC Sections 23.49.011 through 23.49.014. Solely for the purpose of determining the amounts and types of bonus and TDR, if any, that may be used to achieve the proposed increase in chargeable floor area, the legally established continuing chargeable floor area of the existing structures on the lot shall be considered as the base FAR.
2. When mechanical equipment or parking that was exempted from floor area calculation under the provisions of Title 24 is proposed to be changed to uses that are not exempt from floor area calculations under this chapter, and the chargeable floor area on the lot exceeds the base FAR for the zone in which it is located, the gross floor area proposed to be changed shall be achieved through qualifying for bonuses or transfer of development rights, according to the provisions of Sections 23.49.011 through 23.49.014 as applicable to the zone in which the structure is located.
3. When subsection A or B applies, any existing public benefit features for which increased floor area was granted under Title 24 shall, to the extent possible in the opinion of the Director, satisfy the requirements of Section 23.49.034, Modification of plazas and other features bonused under Title 24.

##### 23.49.034 - Modification of plazas and other features bonused under Title 24.

unless the loss of area is offset by the conversion of existing floor area in the structure to uses exempt from chargeable floor area under Section 23.49.011.


1. The modification of plazas, shopping plazas, arcades, shopping arcades, and voluntary building setbacks that resulted in any increase in gross floor area under Title 24 of the Seattle Municipal Code, shall be encouraged in any Downtown zone if the change makes the plaza, arcade or setback more closely conform to the criteria for amenities or street level use and development standards in this chapter. The Director shall review proposed modifications to determine whether they provide greater public benefits and are consistent with the intent of the Downtown Amenity Standards, as specified in this section. The procedure for approval of proposed modifications shall be as provided in Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, except as provided in subsection G of this section.
2. Except as provided in subsections E2 and E3, no modification to a plaza or other feature listed in subsection A may be made under this section if it will increase the total floor area ratio (FAR) of the structure. Except as permitted in subsections E2 and E3, no reduction in the area of the bonused feature may be made for addition or expansion of any uses, except for the following uses, to the extent permitted:

    1. general sales and services,
    2. major durables retail sales,
    3. eating and drinking establishments,
    4. lodging,
    5. entertainment,
    6. automotive sales and services,
    7. marine sales and services,
    8. animal shelters and kennels,
    9. medical services,
    10. human service uses, or
    11. child care centers,
3. Plazas and Shopping Plazas. Modifications to plazas and shopping plazas for which increased gross floor area was granted under Title 24 shall be permitted, based on the classification of the plaza on Map 1E.

    1. Type I Plazas. Type I plazas shall continue to function as major downtown open spaces. Modification of these plazas and/or reductions in plaza size shall be permitted if the Director finds that the modified or remaining plaza is consistent with the intent of the Downtown Amenity Standards for urban plazas and parcel parks.
    2. Type II Plazas. Type II plazas do not function as major downtown open spaces, but they shall continue to provide open space for the public. Modification of these plazas and/or reductions in plaza size shall be permitted if the Director finds that the modified or remaining plaza is consistent with the intent of the Downtown Amenity Standards for urban plazas, parcel parks, and hillside terraces.
4. Shopping Arcades.

    1. Exterior Shopping Arcades. When street level uses are eligible for a floor area bonus in a zone in which an existing exterior shopping arcade is located, the existing shopping arcade or a portion of the existing shopping arcade may be converted to retail sales and service uses if the conversion will result in greater conformity with the street facade development standards of the zone, and if the minimum sidewalk widths established by Section 23.49.022 are met. No bonuses shall be given for any retail space created by conversion of a shopping arcade. New retail sales and service uses shall comply with the Downtown Amenity Standards for retail shopping bonuses.
    2. Interior Shopping Arcades. Portions of existing interior shopping arcades may be modified and/or reduced in size, so long as any pathway which connects streets or other public open spaces is maintained at a width of at least fifteen (15) feet and it continues to allow comfortable and convenient pedestrian movement. The visual interest and the sense of space and light in the shopping arcade shall be also maintained and enhanced if possible. The Downtown Amenity Standards for shopping atriums and shopping corridors shall be used as a guideline in the review of proposed changes.
5. Arcades. The Director shall use the following standards to determine whether an arcade may be filled in, and to determine the uses that may be permitted in a former arcade.

    1. Arcades that provide essential pedestrian connections, such as a connection to a bonused public open space or access to public parks, shall not be filled in.
    2. Arcades that do not provide essential pedestrian connections may be filled in. In downtown areas where bonuses may be granted for shopping atriums and shopping corridors, an arcade may be filled in only with uses which qualify for a retail shopping bonus. In other areas, when the total floor area of the structure does not exceed the maximum permitted FAR, the arcade may be filled in with uses which qualify as required street-level uses except that arcades along alleys may be filled in with any permitted use. If the structure exceeds the maximum permitted FAR, arcades may only be filled in with uses which qualify for a retail shopping bonus.
    3. If an arcade is filled in with a use which does not qualify for a retail shopping bonus pursuant to subsection E2, new public benefit features shall be required for any additional floor area.
    4. Overhead weather protection shall be provided when an arcade on a street or public open space is filled in. No additional floor area shall be granted for the required overhead weather protection.
6. Voluntary Building Setbacks. Voluntary building setbacks may be filled in to provide retail sales and service uses, provided that the conversion maintains the minimum required sidewalk width established in Section 23.49.022, and will result in greater conformity with the standards for required street-level uses, if any, and street facade development standards for the zone.
7. Optional Public Access and Signage Standards. The owner of any lot with a plaza, arcade, shopping plaza, or exterior shopping arcade for which a bonus was granted under Title 24, and which feature has not become subject to standards for amenity features under Title 23, may elect to have the signage requirements and the terms of public access and use for that feature governed by the Downtown Amenity Standards as they apply to urban plazas, as modified by this subsection G. If the owner so elects, then the hours during which such feature must be open to the public without charge shall be as designated by the owner on signs identifying the feature, but in any event shall include the period from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM every day, plus any other hours during which the principal structure on the lot is open. In order to make an election under this subsection G, the owner shall sign and record in the real property records a declaration in form approved by the Director. The owner then shall install and maintain signs identifying the feature as open to the public, consistent with the Downtown Amenity Standards. Such election, once made, may not be revoked or modified. The public access and signage requirements pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed conditions of any permit under which a bonus was allowed for the feature. The purpose of this subsection is to encourage public awareness and use of features bonused under Title 24, while providing for greater certainty and consistency in the rules applicable to such features. Until an election shall be made as to any such feature in compliance with this subsection G, nothing in this subsection G shall limit any obligation to allow public access or use of any such feature under the terms of any permit or Code provision.

##### 23.49.035 - Modified or discontinued public benefit features.

1. All public benefit features, except (1) housing and (2) landmark performing arts theaters, shall remain for the life of the structure that includes the additional gross floor area except as otherwise specifically permitted pursuant to this section.
2. Unless the specified period for which a feature is to be maintained has expired in accordance with the terms of this chapter, or another provision of this chapter specifically otherwise provides, a public benefit feature may be diminished or discontinued only if:

    1. the feature is not housing or child care; and
    2. the additional gross floor area permitted in return for the specific feature is removed or converted to a use that is not counted as chargeable floor area; or

        1. an amount of chargeable floor area equal to that obtained by the public benefit feature to be replaced is provided pursuant to provisions for granting floor area above the base FAR in this chapter.
3. The terms under which use as a Landmark performing arts theater may be discontinued or diminished, and the sanctions for failure to continue such use, shall be governed by the agreements and instruments executed by the City and owners of the properties on which such theaters are located. Any such change in use shall not affect any other structure for which additional FAR was granted in return for the provision of such public benefit features.
4. In addition to the provisions of subsections A and B, this subsection applies in Downtown zones when additional gross floor area or a floor area exemption is granted for any of the following public benefit features: Human service uses, child care centers, retail shopping, cinemas, performing arts theaters other than landmark performing arts theaters, major retail stores, and museums.

    1. In the event that the occupant or operator of one (1) of the public benefit features listed in this subsection moves out of a structure, or notifies the owner of intent to move, the owner or owner's agent shall notify the Director within five (5) days of the date that notice of intent to move is given or that the occupant or operator moves out, whichever is earlier.
    2. Starting from the fifth day after notice is given or that the occupant or operator moves out, whichever is first, the owner or owner's agent shall have a maximum of six (6) months to replace the use with another use that meets the provisions of Section 23.49.011 and the Downtown Amenity Standards.
    3. When the public benefit feature is replaced, any portion of the gross floor area formerly occupied by that feature and not reoccupied by a replacement feature, may be either:

        1. Changed to other uses that are exempt from FAR calculations in the zone in which the structure is located; or
        2. Changed to uses that are not exempt from FAR calculations, provided that this would not cause the structure to exceed the maximum FAR limit for the zone in which it is located, and that gross floor area in an amount equivalent to the gross floor area proposed to be changed shall be achieved through provision of public benefit features, or transfer of development rights, according to the provisions of SMC Section 23.49.011.
    4. As a condition to allowing the substitution of a feature, rather than an application to establish floor area de novo under the terms of this chapter, during the time that the space formerly constituting the amenity feature is vacant, it shall be made available to nonprofit community and charitable organizations for events at no charge.
5. Modifications of amenity features that do not result in the diminishment or discontinuation of the feature may be permitted by the Director as a Type I decision, provided that the Director finds that the feature as modified meets the eligibility conditions in the Downtown Amenity Standards.
6. A qualifying small structure for which a bonus is allowed pursuant to Section 23.49.011 shall be considered discontinued if it is removed or altered so that it is no longer a qualifying small structure within the meaning of that Section.
7. A qualifying Landmark for which a bonus is allowed pursuant to Section 23.49.011 shall be considered discontinued if it is demolished or removed, or it is altered so that it is no longer a qualifying Landmark within the meaning in that Section; or if any feature or characteristic that is controlled or designated by ordinance is removed or altered contrary to any provision of Chapter 25.12; or if the owner fails to maintain in good condition and repair any feature or characteristic of the structure that is designated or subject to controls under any ordinance; or if there is any revision or revocation of controls pursuant to Section 25.12.860 or successor provision.

##### 23.49.036 - Planned community developments (PCDs)

1. Authority. Planned community developments (PCDs) may be permitted by the Director as a Type II Land Use Decision pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions.
2. Public benefit priorities. The Director shall determine public benefit priorities for the PCD. These priorities shall be prepared prior to application for a Master Use Permit. They shall include priorities for public benefits listed in subsection 23.49.036.F and priorities for implementing the goals of the Comprehensive Plan, including adopted neighborhood plans for the area affected by the PCD, and a determination of whether the proposed PCD may use public right-of-way area to meet the minimum site size set forth in subsection 23.49.036.E. Before the priorities are prepared, the Director shall cause a public meeting to be held to identify concerns about the site and to receive public input into priorities for public benefits identified in adopted neighborhood plans and subsection 23.49.036.F. Notice for the meeting shall be provided pursuant to Section 23.76.011. The Director shall prepare priorities for the PCD taking into account comments made at the public meeting or in writing to the Director, and the criteria in this Section 23.49.036. The Director shall distribute a copy of the priorities to all those who provided addresses for this purpose at the public meeting, to those who sent in comments or otherwise requested notification, and to the project proponent.
3. A PCD shall not be permitted if the Director determines it would be likely to result in a net loss of housing units or if it would result in significant alteration to any designated feature of a landmark structure, unless a Certificate of Approval for the alteration is granted by the Landmarks Preservation Board.
4. Location

    1. PCDs may be permitted in all downtown zones except the PMM zone and the DH1 zone.
    2. A portion of a PCD may extend into any non-downtown zone(s) within the Downtown Urban Center and adjacent to a downtown zone subject to the following conditions:

##### 23.49.040 - Termination of discontinued conditional uses.

Any authorized conditional use which has been discontinued shall not be re-established or recommenced except pursuant to a new conditional use permit. The following shall constitute conclusive evidence that the conditional use has been discontinued:

Property which is vacant, except for dead storage of materials or equipment of the conditional use, shall not be considered as being devoted to the authorized conditional use. The expiration of licenses necessary for the conditional use shall be evidence that the property is not being devoted to the conditional use. A conditional use in a multi-family structure or a multi-tenant commercial structure shall not be considered as discontinued unless all units are either vacant or devoted to another use.


1. A permit to change the use of the property has been issued and the new use has been established; or
2. The property has not been devoted to the authorized conditional use for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive months.

##### 23.49.041 - Combined lot development

When authorized by the Director pursuant to this Section 23.49.041, lots located on the same block in DOC1 or DOC2 zones, or in DMC zones with a maximum FAR of 10, or lots zoned DOC1 and DMC on the same block, may be combined, whether contiguous or not, solely for the purpose of allowing some or all of the capacity for chargeable floor area on one such lot under this Chapter 23.49 to be used on one or more other lots, according to the following provisions:


1. Up to all of the capacity on one lot, referred to in this Section 23.49.041 as the "sending lot," for chargeable floor area in addition to the base FAR, pursuant to Section 23.49.011 (referred to in this Section 23.49.041 as "bonus capacity"), may be used on one or more other lots, subject to compliance with all conditions to use of such bonus capacity, pursuant to Sections 23.49.011 through 23.49.014, as modified in this Section 23.49.041. For purposes of applying any conditions related to amenities or features provided on site under Section 23.49.013, only the lot or lots on which such bonus capacity shall be used are considered to be the lot or site using a bonus. Criteria for use of bonus that apply to the structure or structures shall be applied only to the structure(s) on the lots using the transferred bonus capacity.
2. Only if all of the bonus capacity on one lot shall be used on other lots pursuant to this Section 23.49.041, there may also be transferred from the sending lot, to one or more such other lots, up to all of the unused base FAR on the sending lot, without regard to limits on the transfer or on use of TDR in Section 23.49.014. Such transfer shall be treated as a transfer of TDR for purposes of determining remaining development capacity on the sending lot and TDR available to transfer under Section 23.49.014, but shall be treated as additional base FAR on the other lots, and to the extent so treated shall not qualify such lots for bonus development. If less than all of the bonus capacity of the sending lot shall be used on such other lots, then unused base FAR on the sending lot still may be transferred to the extent permitted for within-block TDR under Section 23.49.014, and if the sending lot qualifies for transfer of TDR under any other category of sending lot in Table A for 23.49.014, such unused base FAR may be transferred to the extent permitted for such category, but in each case only to satisfy in part the conditions to use of bonus capacity, not as additional base FAR.
3. To the extent permitted by the Director, the maximum chargeable floor area for any one or more lots in the combined lot development may be increased up to the combined maximum chargeable floor area under Section 23.49.011 computed for all lots participating in the combined lot development. To the extent permitted by the Director, and subject to subsection 23.49.041.B, the base floor area for any one or more lots in the combined lot development may be increased up to the combined maximum base chargeable floor area under Section 23.49.011 computed for all lots participating in the combined lot development.
4. The Director shall allow combined lot development only to the extent that the Director determines in a Type I land use decision that permitting more chargeable floor area than would otherwise be allowed on a lot shall result in a significant public benefit. In addition to features for which floor area bonuses are granted, the Director may also consider the following as public benefits that could satisfy this condition when provided for as a result of the lot combination:

    1. preservation of a landmark structure located on the block or adjacent blocks;
    2. uses serving the downtown residential community, such as a grocery store, at appropriate locations;
    3. public facilities serving the downtown population, including schools, parks, community centers, human service facilities, and clinics;
    4. transportation facilities promoting pedestrian circulation and transit use, including through-block pedestrian connections, transit stations, and bus layover facilities;
    5. short-term parking on blocks within convenient walking distance of the retail core or other downtown business areas where the amount of available short term parking is determined to be insufficient;
    6. a significant amount of housing serving households with a range of income levels;
    7. improved massing of development on the block that achieves a better relationship with surrounding conditions, including: better integration with adjacent development, greater compatibility with an established scale of development, especially relative to landmark structures, or improved conditions for adjacent public open spaces, designated green streets, or other special street environments;
    8. public view protection within an area;
    9. arts and cultural facilities, including a museum or museum expansion space; or
    10. green stormwater infrastructure beyond the requirements of the Stormwater Code (Chapters 22.800 through 22.808).
5. The fee owners of each of the combined lots shall execute an appropriate agreement or instrument, which shall include the legal descriptions of each lot and shall be recorded in the King County real property records. In the agreement or instrument, the owners shall acknowledge the extent to which development capacity on each sending lot is reduced by the use of such capacity on another lot or lots, at least for so long as the chargeable floor area for which such capacity is used remains on such other lot or lots. The deed or instrument shall also provide that its covenants and conditions shall run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by the parties and by the City of Seattle.
6. Nothing in this Section shall allow the development on any lot in a combined lot development to exceed or deviate from height limits or other development standards.

Exhibit A forMinimum Facade Height


1. Facade setback limits

    1. Setback limits for property line facades. The following setback limits apply to all streets designated on Map 1H as requiring property line facades, except as specified in subsection 23.49.056.B.1.d.

        1. The facades of structures 15 feet or less in height shall be located within 2 feet of the street lot line.
        2. Structures greater than 15 feet in height are governed by the following criteria:

            1. No setback limits apply up to an elevation of 15 feet above sidewalk grade.
            2. Between the elevations of 15 and 35 feet above sidewalk grade, the facade shall be located within 2 feet of the street lot line, except that:

                1. Any exterior public open space that satisfies the Downtown Amenity Standards, whether it receives a bonus or not, and any outdoor common recreation area required for residential uses, is not considered part of the setback.
                2. Setbacks between the elevations of 15 and 35 feet above sidewalk grade at the street lot line are permitted according to the following standards, as depicted in Exhibit B for 23.49.056:

                    1. The maximum setback is 10 feet.

                    4. The facade of the structure shall return to within 2 feet of the street lot line between each setback area for a minimum of 10 feet. Balcony railings and other nonstructural features or walls are not considered the facade of the structure.
![23-49-056-C.png](./images/23-49-056-C.png)


Exhibit B forException to Maximum Setback Limits


1. If sidewalk widening is required by Section 23.49.022, setback standards shall be measured to the line established by the new sidewalk width rather than the street lot line.
2. In the DMC 160 zone, on lots that abut Alaskan Way, as an alternative to the standards for required property line facades in subsections 23.49.056.B.1.a, 23.49.056.B.1.b, and 23.49.056.B.1.c, a continuous setback of up to 16 feet from the lot line abutting Alaskan Way is allowed for the street-facing facade. If the alternative setback allowed by this subsection 23.49.056.B.1.d is provided, the setback area shall be used for outdoor uses related to abutting street-level uses, for landscaped open space, for a partially above-grade story that meets the conditions of subsection 23.49.011.B.1.u, or to widen the abutting sidewalk for pedestrian use.
3. General Setback Limits. The following setback limits apply on streets not requiring property line facades, as shown on Map 1H:

    1. The portion of a structure subject to setback limits shall vary according to the structure height and required minimum facade height, as follows:

        1. Except as provided in subsection 23.49.056.B.2.a.3, if the structure is greater than 15 feet in height, the setback limits apply to the facade between an elevation of 15 feet above sidewalk grade and the minimum facade height established in subsection 23.49.056.A and illustrated in Exhibit C for 23.49.056.
        2. If the entire structure is 15 feet or less in height, the setback limits apply to the entire street-facing facade.
        3. If the minimum facade height is 15 feet, the setback limits apply to the portion of the street-facing facade that is 15 feet or less in height.
    2. The maximum area of all setbacks between the street lot line and facade along each street frontage of a lot shall not exceed the area derived by multiplying the averaging factor by the width of the street frontage of the structure along that street (see Exhibit D for 23.49.056). The averaging factor is five on Class I pedestrian streets and ten on Class II pedestrian streets and designated green streets.
    3. The maximum width, measured along the street lot line, of any setback area exceeding a depth of 15 feet from the street lot line shall not exceed 80 feet, or 30 percent of the lot frontage on that street, whichever is less. (See Exhibit D for 23.49.056.)
    4. The maximum setback of the facade from the street lot lines at intersections is 10 feet. The minimum distance the facade must conform to this limit is 20 feet along each street. (See Exhibit E for 23.49.056.)
    5. Any exterior public open space that meets the Downtown Amenity Standards, whether it receives a bonus or not, and any outdoor common recreation area required for residential uses, is not considered part of a setback. (See Exhibit C for 23.49.056.)
    6. If a sidewalk is widened into the lot as a condition to development, setback standards shall be measured to the line established by the new sidewalk width rather than the street lot line.
4. Facade Transparency Requirements.

    1. Facade transparency requirements apply to the area of the facade between 2 feet and 8 feet above the sidewalk, except that if the slope along the street frontage of the facade exceeds 7.5 percent, the transparency requirements apply to the area of the facade between 4 feet and 8 feet above sidewalk grade. Only clear or lightly tinted glass in windows, doors, and display windows is considered to be transparent. Transparent areas shall allow views into the structure or into display windows from the outside.
    2. Facade transparency requirements do not apply to portions of structures in residential use.
    3. If the transparency requirements of this subsection 23.49.056.C are inconsistent with the glazing limits in the Energy Code, this subsection 23.49.056.C applies to the extent permitted by applicable law.
    4. Transparency requirements are as follows:

        1. Class I pedestrian streets and designated green streets: A minimum of 60 percent of the street level street-facing facade shall be transparent.
        2. Class II pedestrian streets: A minimum of 30 percent of the street level street-facing facade shall be transparent.
        3. Where the slope along the street frontage of the facade exceeds 7.5 percent, the required amount of transparency shall be reduced to 50 percent on Class I pedestrian streets and designated green streets and 25 percent on Class II pedestrian streets.
5. Blank Facade Limits.

    1. General Provisions.

        1. Blank facade limits apply to the area of the facade between 2 feet and 8 feet above the sidewalk, except that where the slope along the street frontage of the facade exceeds 7.5 percent, blank facade limits apply to the area of the facade between 4 feet and 8 feet above sidewalk grade.
        2. Any portion of a facade that is not transparent shall be considered to be a blank facade.
        3. Blank facade limits do not apply to portions of structures in residential use.
    2. Blank Facade Limits for Class I Pedestrian Streets and Designated Green Streets.

        1. Blank facades shall be no more than 15 feet wide except segments with garage doors may exceed a width of 15 feet and may be as wide as the driveway plus 5 feet. Blank facade segment width may be increased to 30 feet if the Director in a Type I decision determines that the facade segment is enhanced by features with visual interest such as architectural detailing, artwork, landscaping, or similar features.
        2. Any blank segments of the facade shall be separated by transparent areas at least 2 feet wide.
        3. The total width of all blank facade segments, including garage doors, shall not exceed 40 percent of the street-facing facade of the structure on each street frontage, or 50 percent if the slope of the street frontage of the facade exceeds 7.5 percent.
    3. Blank Facade Limits for Class II Pedestrian Streets.

        1. Blank façade segments shall be no more than 30 feet wide, except for garage doors, which may exceed 30 feet. Blank facade segment width may be increased to 60 feet if the Director in a Type I decision determines that the facade segment is enhanced by architectural detailing, artwork, landscaping, or similar features that have visual interest. The width of garage doors shall be limited to the width of the driveway plus 5 feet.
        2. Any blank segments of the facade shall be separated by transparent areas at least 2 feet wide.
        3. The total of all blank facade segments, including garage doors, shall not exceed 70 percent of the street facade of the structure on each street frontage; or 75 percent if the slope of the street frontage of the facade exceeds 7.5 percent.
6. Street Tree Requirements. Street trees are required on all streets that have a pedestrian classification and abut a lot. If areaways are located beneath the sidewalk, the street trees shall be planted in below-grade containers with provisions for watering the trees. Street trees shall be planted according to street tree planting standards in the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual.
7. Setback and landscaping requirements for lots located within the Denny Triangle Urban Center Village

Map A for: Belltown Urban Center Village


1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection 23.49.058.F, in the DMC zone with a mapped height limit of more than 160 feet located in the Denny Triangle Urban Center Village, as shown on Map A for 23.49.056, if any part of a tower exceeds 160 feet in height, then all portions of the tower that are above 125 feet in height must be separated from any other existing tower that is above 160 feet in height, and the minimum separation required between towers from all points above the height of 125 feet in each tower is 60 feet.
2. The projection of unenclosed decks and balconies, and architectural features such as cornices, shall be disregarded in calculating tower separation.
3. If the presence of an existing tower would preclude the addition of another tower proposed on the same block, as a special exception, the Director may waive or modify the tower spacing requirements of this Section 23.49.058 to allow a maximum of two towers to be located on the same block that are not separated by at least the minimum spacing required in subsections 23.49.058.F.2, 23.49.058.F.3 and 23.49.058.F.4, other than towers described in subsection 23.49.058.F.1. The Director shall determine that issues raised in the design review process related to the presence of the additional tower have been adequately addressed before granting any exceptions to tower spacing standards. The Director shall consider the following factors in determining whether such an exception shall be granted:

    1. potential impact of the additional tower on adjacent residential structures, located within the same block and on adjacent blocks, in terms of views, privacy, and shadows;
    2. potential public benefits that offset the impact of the reduction in required separation between towers, including the provision of public open space, designated green street or other streetscape improvements, preservation of landmark structures, and provision of neighborhood commercial services, such as a grocery store, or community services, such as a community center or school;
    3. potential impact on the public environment, including shadow and view impacts on nearby streets and public open spaces;
    4. design characteristics of the additional tower in terms of overall bulk and massing, facade treatments and transparency, visual interest, and other features that may offset impacts related to the reduction in required separation between towers;
    5. the City's goal of encouraging residential development downtown; and
    6. the feasibility of developing the site without an exception from the tower spacing requirement.
4. For purposes of this Section 23.49.058, an "existing" tower is either:

    1. a tower that is physically present, except as provided below in this subsection 23.49.058.F.7, or
    2. a proposed tower for which a Master Use Permit decision that includes approval of the Design Review element has been issued, unless and until either (i) the Master Use Permit issued pursuant to such decision expires or is cancelled, or the related application is withdrawn by the applicant, without the tower having been constructed; or (ii) a ruling by a hearing examiner or court of competent jurisdiction reversing or vacating such decision, or determining such decision or the Master Use Permit issued thereunder to be invalid, becomes final and no longer subject to judicial review.
A tower that is physically present shall not be considered "existing" if the owner of the lot where such tower is located shall have applied to the Director for a permit to demolish such tower and such application shall be pending or a permit issued for such demolition shall be in effect, but any permit decision or permit for any structure that would not be permitted under this subsection 23.49.058.F.7 if such tower were considered "existing" may be conditioned upon the actual demolition of such tower.


1. For purposes of this Section 23.49.058, except in zones with a mapped height limit of 160 feet or less, a "tower" is a portion of a structure, not including rooftop features that would be permitted above the applicable height limit pursuant to Section 23.49.008, in which portion all gross floor area in each story is horizontally contiguous, and which portion is above (i) a height of 85 feet in a structure that has any non-residential use above a height of 65 feet or does not have residential use above a height of 160 feet; or (ii) in any structure not described in clause (i) a height determined as follows:

    1. For a structure on a lot that includes an entire block front or that is on a block front with no other structures, 65 feet; or
    2. For a structure on any other lot, the height of the facade closest to the street property line of the existing structure on the same block front nearest to that lot, but if the nearest existing structures are equidistant from that lot, then the height of the higher such facade; but in no instance shall the height exceed 85 feet or be required to be less than 65 feet.
2. The requirements of subsections 23.49.058.C and 23.49.058.D apply to:

    1. All structures 160 feet in height or less, and all structures in the DMC 160 zone, in which any story above an elevation of 85 feet above the adjacent sidewalk exceeds 15,000 square feet. For structures with separate towers, the 15,000 square foot threshold applies to each tower individually; and
    2. Portions of structures in non-residential use above a height of 160 feet in which any story above an elevation of 85 feet exceeds 15,000 square feet. For structures with separate towers, the 15,000 square foot threshold applies to each tower individually.
3. Facade modulation

    1. In DOC 1, DOC 2, and DMC zones, except the DMC 160 zone, facade modulation is required above a height of 85 feet above the sidewalk for any portion of a structure located within 15 feet of a street lot line. No modulation is required for portions of a facade set back 15 feet or more from a street lot line.
    2. In the DMC 160 zone, facade modulation is required above a height of 60 feet above the sidewalk for any portion of a structure located within 15 feet of a street lot line. No modulation is required for portions of a facade set back 15 feet or more from a street lot line.
    3. The maximum length of a facade without modulation is prescribed in Table A for 23.49.058. This maximum length shall be measured parallel to each street lot line, and shall apply to any portion of a facade, including projections such as balconies, that is located within 15 feet of street lot lines.
    4. Any portion of a facade exceeding the maximum length of facade prescribed on Table A for 23.49.058 shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from the street lot line for a minimum distance of 60 feet before any other portion may be within 15 feet of the street lot line.
4. Upper-level width limit

    1. On lots where the width and depth of the lot each exceed 200 feet, the maximum facade width for any portion of a structure above 240 feet shall be 145 feet along the general north/south axis of a site (parallel to the Avenues), and this portion of the structure shall be separated horizontally from any other portion of a structure on the lot above 240 feet by at least 80 feet at all points.
    2. In the DMC 160 zone, the maximum facade width of any portion of a structure above 60 feet in height shall be 180 feet along lots fronting on Alaskan Way or Western Avenue between University and Union Streets. This portion of the structure shall be separated horizontally from any other portion of a structure on the lot above 60 feet in height by at least 30 feet at all points. If the separation between portions of a structure above 60 feet in height is less than 30 feet, the widths of the separated portions of the structure shall be combined to determine the structure's width.
5. Tower floor area limits and tower width limits for portions of structures in residential use. The requirements of this subsection 23.49.058.E apply only to structures that include portions in residential use above a height of 160 feet, and do not apply in the DMC 160 zone.

    1. Maximum limits on average residential gross floor area per story and maximum residential floor area per story of towers are prescribed in Table B for 23.49.058.

            2. Where set back, the street-facing façade is measured from a location other than the street lot line in the following instances:

                1. If a utility easement abutting a street lot line prevents a structure from extending to the street lot line, a street-facing façade setback shall be measured from the abutting utility easement rather than the street lot line.
                2. On Occidental Avenue S., a street-facing façade setback shall be measured from the setback line provided pursuant to subsection 23.49.180.G.1.a.2 rather than the street lot line.
            3. The maximum length of any setback area, as measured along the street lot line, shall not exceed 60 feet.
            4. Except as needed to accommodate required access to utility easements, no setback of a street-facing façade is permitted along S. King Street for 60 feet on either side of the intersection with the open area aligned with 2nd Avenue S. provided pursuant to subsection 23.49.180.G.6.c.

##### 23.49.181 - Bonus floor area for affordable housing in the PSM 85-120 zone

1. Purpose; Scope of provisions; State law controlling. This Section 23.49.181 establishes an affordable housing incentive program for development on lots zoned PSM 85-120 that are subject to FAR limits pursuant to the provisions of Section 23.49.180. Chargeable floor area in addition to the base FAR is allowed for development that includes residential use, to the extent that the applicant qualifies by providing low-income housing, in accordance with this Section 23.49.181 and subject to the provisions of Section 23.49.180. In case of any irreconcilable conflict between the terms of this Section 23.49.181 and the authority granted in RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended, the provisions of RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended, shall supersede and control. Unless the context otherwise clearly requires, references to RCW 36.70A.540 in this Section 23.49.181 mean that section in effect on the date as of which the provisions of this Title 23 apply to the application for a use permit for the project using the bonus floor area.
2. Permitting Conditions

    1. Master Use Permit. The Master Use Permit application to establish any bonus floor area under this Section 23.49.181 shall include a calculation of the total amount of bonus floor area sought and shall identify the quantity and type of affordable housing to be provided to satisfy the conditions to such bonus floor area. The application shall include the proposed location of the affordable housing. If any of the affordable housing is proposed to be within the area defined on Map A for Section 23.49.180 where additional height is permitted, the application shall include the location of the affordable housing within that area and its distribution within the proposed building(s). If any of the affordable housing is not to be provided within the area defined on Map A for Section 23.49.180 where additional height is permitted, the application shall include the address, legal description, dimensions and ownership of the other lot(s), and the approval of the Director of Housing for the affordable housing to be provided on the other lot(s), pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.E.3. The Director shall, at the time of issuance of any Master Use Permit decision approving any bonus floor area, issue a Type I decision as to the amount of bonus floor area to be allowed and the conditions to such bonus floor area. A declaration signed by the applicant and any other owners of the lot(s) on which the project using the bonus floor area is to be built and any other owners, or persons with control, of the lot(s) where the affordable housing will be located, on a form approved by the Director, specifying the amount of bonus floor area, the legal descriptions of the lot where the bonus floor area will be used and each other lot where affordable housing will be located, and the conditions, must be executed and recorded as a condition to issuance of the Master Use Permit for a development to include bonus floor area. If a change in the total bonus floor area to be developed, or a change in the location of the affordable housing approved by the Director of Housing pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.E.3, results in adjustment to one or more conditions, the declaration and any related conditions of the Master Use Permit may be amended, with the written approval of the Director, as a Type I decision. In requesting amendment of a declaration under this subsection 23.49.181.B and any related conditions of the Master Use Permit, the applicant may elect, consistent with subsection 23.76.026.G, that the provisions of this Section 23.49.181 as in effect on the date of the Director's action on that request, rather than any earlier date applicable under Section 23.76.026, apply for purposes of the amendment to the Master Use Permit.
    2. First Building Permit.

        1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection 23.49.181.B.2.a, prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of the first building permit for a structure using bonus floor area, the owner of each lot that will include the affordable housing for that bonus floor area shall execute and record an agreement in a form acceptable to the Director of Housing that shall commit to provide that affordable housing, and shall run with the land to bind successors. The applicant shall submit an acceptable agreement, fully signed, as part of the building permit application, and if there is any change in ownership or if the location at which any affordable housing is to be provided is modified pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.B.1 prior to the issuance of the building permit, the new owners or any other owners of the lot(s) where the affordable housing is to be provided, or both, as applicable, shall execute the agreement or an addendum, substitute or separate agreement, acceptable to the Director of Housing. This subsection 23.49.181.B.2.a does not apply with respect to bonus floor area that is based on an amount of affordable housing for which a certification by the Director of Housing is delivered pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.B.3.
        2. If the affordable housing is to be located on any lot(s) not owned by the applicant, then the applicant shall demonstrate that the applicant is providing the affordable housing on the other lot(s) in connection with the applicant's project, as set forth below in this subsection 23.49.181.B.2.b. Prior to issuance, and as a condition to issuance, of the first building permit for a structure using bonus floor area, the applicant shall provide to the Director of Housing a copy of a signed and binding linkage agreement, acceptable to the Director of Housing, with the owner(s) or person(s) in control of those lots, pursuant to which only the applicant has the right to claim such housing for purposes of bonus development under this Section 23.49.181 or any other bonus or benefit under this Title 23, and shall demonstrate that the applicant has made a financial contribution to the affordable housing, or has promised such contribution in that linkage agreement and has provided to the City an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit to ensure its payment, in form and content satisfactory to the Director of Housing, in either case in an amount determined by the Director of Housing to be, when reduced by the value of any expected benefits to be received for such contribution other than the bonus development, approximately equal to the subsidy gap for construction in South Downtown of at least the minimum amount of affordable housing determined under this Section 23.49.181 for the amount of bonus floor area sought by the applicant. The Director of Housing may require that one or more parties to a linkage agreement enter into an agreement with the City to establish performance criteria to be met in the development of the affordable housing, to provide for control of the financial contribution from the applicant to ensure its use for the affordable housing, and to provide for its use for alternative affordable housing if performance criteria are not met. The Director of Finance is authorized to establish any funds or accounts that the Director of Housing may deem necessary for the deposit of funds under any agreement authorized in this subsection 23.49.181.B.2.b., and to make disbursements from such funds or accounts as directed by the Director of Housing, but the monies in such funds or accounts shall not become property of the City unless applied against obligations owing to the City, and the expenditure of those monies on any project or contract shall not cause it to be treated as a public work or contract of the City.
    3. Effect of Certification by Director of Housing. If the Director of Housing certifies to the Director that either (a) the applicant has provided the City with (i) a satisfactory linkage agreement; (ii) evidence of a sufficient financial contribution, a letter of credit, or other sufficient security pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.B.2.b; and (iii) such other agreements as the Director of Housing requires pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.B.2.b, all sufficient for purposes of providing a specified amount of affordable housing consistent with this Section 23.49.181; or (b) there have been recorded one or more agreements or instruments satisfactory to the Director of Housing providing for occupancy and affordability restrictions on affordable housing with the minimum floor area determined under this Section 23.49.181 for the amount of bonus floor area sought by the applicant, all affordable housing has been completed, and the affordable housing either is on a different lot from the bonus floor area or is located in one or more condominium units separate from the bonus floor area under condominium documents acceptable to the Director of Housing; then any failure of the affordable housing to be completed or to satisfy the requirements of subsection 23.49.181.E shall not affect the right to maintain or occupy the bonus floor area and shall not cause the applicant or owner of the lot with the bonus floor area to be in violation of this Title 23. If all conditions to the certification in clause (a)(i) and (a)(iii) of this subsection 23.49.181.B.3, but not clause (a)(ii), are satisfied, the Director of Housing may deposit a certification with an escrow agent, with irrevocable instructions to date and deliver the certification when the escrow agent holds the necessary funds for delivery to an appropriate account as a contribution to the affordable housing, and delivery of the certification by the escrow agent shall then have the same effect as certification by the Director of Housing on the date of that delivery.
3. Findings. Pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70A.540, the City finds that the higher income levels specified in the definition of "income-eligible households" in this Section 23.49.181, rather than those stated in the definition of "low-income households" in RCW 36.70A.540, are needed to address local housing market conditions in the area to which this Section 23.49.181 applies.
4. Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 23.49.181:

    1. "Affordable housing" means a unit or units of low-income housing provided as a condition to bonus floor area.
    2. "Base FAR" or "base floor area ratio" means a FAR of 4.
    3. "Bonus floor area" means all chargeable floor area allowed in addition to the base FAR.
    4. "Income-eligible households" means:

        1. In the case of rental housing, households with incomes no higher than 80 percent of median income as defined in Section 23.84A.025.
        2. In the case of owner occupancy housing units, households with incomes no higher than the median income as defined in Section 23.84A.025.
        3. "Low-income housing" means housing that serves income-eligible households as determined in subsection 23.49.181.E.
        4. "Net bonus floor area" means gross square footage of bonus floor area, multiplied by an efficiency factor of 80 percent.
5. Affordable housing

    1. Amount. An applicant using bonus floor area shall provide an amount of net rentable floor area of low-income housing, applicable to units for sale or rent, equal to at least 17.5 percent of the net bonus floor area obtained. For purposes of this subsection 23.49.181.E, "net rentable floor area" is equal to 80 percent of the gross floor area of the low-income housing.
    2. Serving income-eligible households. For the purposes of this Section 23.49.181, a housing unit serves income-eligible households only if either:

        1. For a period of 50 years beginning upon the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections for the affordable housing, the housing is used as rental housing solely for income-eligible households at rent limited so that annual housing costs, including rent and basic utilities, do not exceed 30 percent of 80 percent of median income, and the housing unit and the structure in which it is located are maintained in decent and habitable condition, including basic appliances in the housing unit; or
        2. The unit is sold for owner-occupancy to an income-eligible household at an initial sale price limited so that the annual housing costs, including mortgage principal and interest, real estate taxes, insurance, plus homeowner dues if applicable, are not expected to exceed 35 percent of median income, according to a calculation based on reasonable assumptions and approved by the Director of Housing, and the unit is subject to a recorded instrument satisfactory to the Director of Housing with a term extending until 50 years after the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections for the structure using the bonus floor area for which that affordable housing is provided, providing for sales prices on any resale consistent with affordability on the same basis as the initial sale, allowing resales only to income-eligible households, and requiring that upon any resale, the housing unit be in decent and habitable condition, including adequate basic appliances in the housing unit.
    3. Location, size, and other requirements. Affordable housing may be provided within the area defined on Map A for 23.49.180 where additional height is permitted. Alternatively, affordable housing may be provided on one or more different lots within South Downtown, subject to approval by the Director of Housing under the criteria in this subsection 23.49.181.E and to the conditions in subsection 23.49.181.B.2. Approval requires a determination by the Director of Housing that the affordable housing will (a) provide a public benefit; and (b) be more affordable than market rents or sale prices, as applicable, for housing in South Downtown. The affordable housing shall be provided in a range of unit sizes consistent with RCW 36.70A.540 and comply with all requirements of RCW 36.70A.540.
    4. Time of completion. Unless affordable housing is to be provided on a lot other than that of the project using the bonus and the Director of Housing has made all approvals described in subsections 23.49.181.B.2 and 23.49.181.E.3, the affordable housing shall be completed and ready for occupancy at or before the time when a certificate of occupancy is issued for any bonus floor area that is based on the affordable housing and as a condition to any right of the applicant to such a certificate of occupancy.
    5. No subsidies for affordable housing; exceptions

        1. In general, and except as may be otherwise required by applicable federal or state law, no bonus floor area may be earned by providing affordable housing if:

            1. Any person is receiving or will receive with respect to the housing any charitable contributions or public subsidies for housing development or operation, including, but not limited to, tax exempt bond financing, low-income housing tax credits, federal loans or grants, City of Seattle housing loans or grants, county housing funds, and State of Washington housing funds; or
            2. The housing is or would be, independent of the requirements for the bonus floor area, subject to any restrictions on the income of occupants, rents or sale prices.
        2. As exceptions to the general rule in subsection 23.49.181.E.5.a:

            1. All affordable housing provided as a condition to bonus floor area within the area defined on Map A for 23.49.180 where additional height is permitted may consist wholly or in part of the same units used to satisfy terms under which the lot or a portion thereof was transferred by a public body, and any units of affordable housing provided as a condition to bonus floor area on a lot outside the area defined on Map A for 23.49.180 where additional height is permitted, may consist wholly or in part of the same units used to satisfy terms under which the lot or a portion thereof was transferred by a public body;
            2. The improvements on the lot may qualify for, and affordable housing provided as a condition to bonus floor area may consist wholly or in part of the same units used to satisfy conditions of, property tax exemptions pursuant to Chapter 5.73; and
            3. The prohibition on public subsidies for affordable housing does not include Internal Revenue Code Section 45D, New Markets Tax Credits.
        3. The Director of Housing may require, as a condition of any bonus floor area, that the owner of the lot upon which the affordable housing is located agree not to seek or accept any subsidies, other than as described in subsection 23.49.181.E.5.b, related to housing. The Director of Housing may require that such agreement provide for the payment to the City, for deposit in an appropriate sub-fund or account, of the value of any subsidies received in excess of any amounts allowed by such agreement.
        4. As an exception to the restriction on subsidies, the Director of Housing may allow the building or buildings in which the affordable housing is located to be financed in part with subsidies based on determinations that:

            1. the total amount of affordable housing is at least 300 net residential square feet greater than the minimum amount of affordable housing that would be needed to satisfy the conditions of this Section 23.49.181;
            2. the public benefit of the affordable housing net of those subsidies, as measured through an economic analysis, exceeds the public benefit from the minimum amount of affordable housing; and
            3. the subsidies being allowed would not be sufficient to leverage private funds for production of the affordable housing, under restrictions required in this Section 23.49.181, without additional City subsidy.
    6. Agreements and approvals. The Director of Housing is authorized to accept and execute agreements and instruments to implement this Section 23.49.181. Except with respect to bonus floor area based on an amount of affordable housing for which a certification by the Director of Housing is delivered pursuant to subsection 23.49.181.B.3, issuance of the Master Use Permit, building permit, or certificate of occupancy for the project using the bonus floor area may be conditioned on satisfactory agreements and instruments signed by applicants and other owners. An applicant or prospective applicant may request, and the Director of Housing may provide, a determination that a linkage agreement or security arrangement, or both, would satisfy specific provisions of this Section 23.49.181, whether or not an applicant has proposed a specific development to use bonus floor area, but no such approval or agreement shall affect the determination, under Chapter 23.76 or other applicable law, of the date as of which any development regulations apply to a permit application.
    7. Reports and fees. An applicant for bonus floor area shall pay a review fee and the housing owner shall provide annual reports to the Office of Housing. Fees shall be paid in accordance with the applicable fee ordinance item or Section 22.900G.015.
6. Identification of bonus floor area. The floor area that constitutes bonus floor area under this Section 23.49.181 shall be determined according to the order in which Master Use Permits are issued to establish the chargeable floor area, with the base FAR allocable to the earlier Master Use Permits. Within a structure or structures developed under a single Master Use Permit that involves both base floor area and bonus floor area:

    1. If the complete applications for building permits for construction, not including any permits limited to excavation and shoring, are submitted at different times, then unless otherwise specifically identified in the Master Use Permit application and approved by the Director, the base floor area shall be allocated first to the structure or structures for which the earlier complete building permit applications are submitted; and
    2. If the complete applications for building permits for construction, not including any permits limited to excavation and shoring, are submitted at the same time, then unless otherwise specifically identified in the Master Use Permit application and approved by the Director, the bonus floor area shall be the chargeable floor area, excluding any affordable housing, in the highest stories in the structure or structures, and if only a portion of a story consists of bonus floor area, it shall be allocated to each portion of that story in proportion to its chargeable floor area, excluding any affordable housing, within that story.
7. Obligation of Owners.

    1. Except as otherwise expressly provided in subsection 23.49.181.B.3, any owner of bonus floor area shall be in violation of this Title 23 if:

        1. any housing units to be provided as affordable housing for that bonus floor area are not timely completed and ready for occupancy, or are not subject to a recorded instrument binding on the owner thereof as provided in this Section 23.49.181; or
        2. at any time during the period specified in subsection 23.49.180.E.2, any rental housing unit provided or to be provided under this Section 23.49.181 for that bonus floor area does not serve income-eligible households; or
        3. any housing unit provided or to be provided as affordable housing for owner occupancy for that bonus floor area under subsection 23.49.181.E.2.b is initially transferred other than in a sale to an income-eligible household, and subject to a recorded instrument, consistent with that subsection 23.49.181.E.2.b.
    2. Any owner of a housing unit provided or to be provided as affordable housing in accordance with this Section 23.49.181 shall be in violation of this Title 23 if either:

        1. for a rental housing unit, at any time during the period specified in subsection 23.49.181.E.2 it does not serve income-eligible households within the meaning of that subsection 23.49.181.E.2; or
        2. in the case of a unit provided or to be provided for owner occupancy, the owner causes or permits the transfer of the unit, or of the right to occupy the unit, or any offer for any transfer, contrary to the terms of a recorded instrument then in effect pursuant to this Section 23.49.181.

These standards shall apply to each lot line that abuts a street designated on Map 1F as having a pedestrian classification. The standards for each street frontage shall vary according to the pedestrian classification of the street on Map 1F.


1. Minimum Facade Height.

    1. Minimum facade height shall be as described in the table below, and as shown in Exhibit 23.49.332 A, but the minimum facade heights shall not apply when all portions of the structure are lower than the elevation of the required minimum facade height listed below.
    2. On designated view corridors described in Section 23.49.024, the minimum facade height shall be the required elevation of the setback when it is less than the minimum facade height required in subsection A1.
2. Facade Setback Limits.

    1. Except when the entire structure is less than or equal to fifteen (15) feet in height, or when the minimum facade height established in subsection A of this section is fifteen (15) feet, the setback limits shall apply to the facade between an elevation of fifteen (15) feet above sidewalk grade and the minimum facade height established in subsection A of this section (and see Exhibit 23.49.332B). When the structure is less than or equal to fifteen (15) feet in height, the setback limits shall apply to the entire street facade. When the minimum facade height is fifteen (15) feet, the setback limits shall apply to the portion of the street facade that is fifteen (15) feet or less in height.
    2. The maximum area of all setbacks between the lot line and facade along each street frontage of a lot shall not exceed the area determined by multiplying the averaging factor times the width of the street frontage of the lot along that street (see Exhibit 23.49.332C). The averaging factor shall be thirty (30) on both Class II pedestrian streets and designated green streets. Parking shall not be located between the facade and the street property line.
    3. The maximum width, measured along the street property line, of any setback area exceeding a depth of fifteen (15) feet from the street property line shall not exceed eighty (80) feet, or thirty (30) percent of the lot frontage on that street, whichever is less. (See Exhibit 23.49.332 C.)
    4. The maximum setback of the facade from the street property line at intersections shall be ten (10) feet. The minimum distance the facade must conform to this limit shall be twenty (20) feet along each street. (See Exhibit 23.49.332 D.)
    5. Any exterior public open space that satisfies the Downtown Amenity Standards, whether it receives a bonus or not, and any outdoor common recreation area required for residential uses, shall not be considered part of a setback. (See Exhibit 23.49.332 B.)
    6. When sidewalk widening is required by Section 23.49.022, setback standards shall be measured to the line established by the new sidewalk width rather than the street property line.
3. Facade Transparency Requirements.

    1. Facade transparency requirements apply to the area of the facade between two (2) feet and eight (8) feet above the sidewalk, except that where the slope along the street frontage of the facade exceeds seven and one-half (7½) percent, the facade transparency requirements apply to the area of the facade between four (4) feet and eight (8) feet above sidewalk grade. Only clear or lightly tinted glass in windows, doors, and display windows is considered to be transparent. Transparent areas shall allow views into the structure or into display windows from the outside.
    2. Facade transparency requirements do not apply to portions of structures in residential use.

1. Applicability

    1. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 23.50.027, the maximum size of use limits on gross floor area specified in Table A for 23.50.027 apply to principal uses on a lot, and apply separately to the categories of uses. The total gross floor area occupied by uses limited under Table A for 23.50.027 shall not exceed 2.5 times the area of the lot in an IG1, IG2, IB, or IC zone.
    2. The combined square footage of any one business establishment located on more than one lot is subject to the size limitations on non-industrial uses specified on Table A for 23.50.027.
    3. The maximum size of use limits in Table A for 23.50.027 do not apply to the area identified in Exhibit A for 23.50.027. In that area no single non-office use listed in Table A for 23.50.027 may exceed 50,000 square feet in size.
2. The following exceptions to the size limitations in Table A for 23.50.027 are allowed for a structure existing as of September 26, 2007:

    1. A use legally established as of September 26, 2007 that already exceeds the size limitations listed in Table A for 23.50.027 may continue.
    2. Subject to the limitations in subsection 23.50.027.E, the gross floor area of a use listed in Table A for 23.50.027 and legally established as of September 26, 2007 may be converted to another category of use listed in Table A for 23.50.027 provided that the combined gross floor area devoted to uses listed in Table A for 23.50.027 does not exceed the total gross floor area of such uses legally established as of September 26, 2007.
    3. If 50 percent or more of the gross floor area of the structure has been legally established as of September 26, 2007 with a use or uses listed in Table A for 23.50.027, those categories of uses may exceed the size of use limits as follows:

        1. Uses listed in Table A for 23.50.027 may expand within and occupy the entire structure.
        2. The structure may be expanded by up to the following amounts and the use or uses may be permitted to expand within and occupy the entire structure:

            1. IG1 and IG2 Zones: 20 percent of the existing structure's gross floor area or 10,000 square feet, whichever is less;
            2. IB and IC Zones: 20 percent of the existing structure's gross floor area or 20,000 square feet, whichever is less.
3. Special Exceptions for Office Use.

    1. Office Uses that are not Public Facilities Operated for Public Purposes by Units or Instrumentalities of Special or General Purpose Government or the City.

        1. The Director may permit an office use to exceed the size of use limits as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, provided that the total gross floor area devoted to the uses limited in Table A for 23.50.027 shall not exceed an area equal to the area of the lot in an IG1 zone or 2.5 times the area of the lot in an IG2 or IB zone, and either the office is on the same lot as, and accessory to, a permitted use not listed in Table A for 23.50.027; or the office is a principal use on the same or another lot within 1 mile distance of a permitted use not listed in Table A for 23.50.027 and is directly related to and supportive of that use.
        2. The Director shall use the following characteristics to determine whether to approve, approve with conditions or deny a special exception:

            1. Characteristics that make a lot more appropriate for office uses are:

                1. The presence of well-defined boundaries, buffers, edge conditions or circulation patterns that separate office uses from industrial activity;
                2. The likelihood that the proposed use will provide or encourage improvements that will directly support industrial activity in the area;
                3. The likelihood that the proposed use, because of its type, size and location, will operate without substantial conflicts with the industrial function of the area;
                4. A sufficiently large industrial area such that the proposed use would not undermine the area's industrial character.
            2. Characteristics that make a lot less appropriate for office uses are:

                1. The presence of heavy industrial uses that would conflict with office use;
                2. The presence of any special features, such as access to the water, rail and the regional highway systems, that make the land especially well-suited to industrial use.
    2. Office Uses in Public Facilities Operated for Public Purposes by Units or Instrumentalities of Special or General Purpose Government or the City in IG1 Zones. The Director may permit office uses in existing vacant structures that were and are to be used as public facilities operated for public purposes by units or instrumentalities of special or general purpose government or the City on lots zoned IG1 to exceed the size limits referenced in Table A for 23.50.027 as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, under the following circumstances:

        1. Eligible Sites. To be eligible to apply for this exception the lot must meet the following criteria:

            1. The lot and its structures are owned by a unit or instrumentality of special or general purpose government or the City and must have been owned by a unit or instrumentality of special or general purpose government or the City on January 1, 2000;
            2. The lot is at least 500,000 square feet;
            3. The lot contains existing structures with a total gross floor area of at least 300,000 square feet that were at least 50 percent vacant continuously since September 1, 1997; and
            4. The lot and the existing structures on the lot must have functioned most recently as a public facility operated for a public purpose by a unit or instrumentality of special or general purpose government or the City, and

                1. The previous public facility must have had at least ten percent of its gross floor area functioning as accessory or principal offices; and
                2. The previous public facility must have had at least 25 percent of its gross floor area functioning as one or more of the following uses or categories of uses:

                    1. Warehouse,
                    2. Light, general or heavy manufacturing,

3. Industrial Commercial, Floor Area Ratio. The base and maximum FARs in IC zones are set forth on Table A for 23.50.028.
4. Extra floor area.

    1. In an IC 85-160 zone, extra nonresidential floor area as defined in Section 23.58A.004 may be added above the base FAR up to the maximum FAR allowed by Table A for 23.50.028 for development that satisfies all applicable conditions of Section 23.50.028, Section 23.50.033 and Chapter 23.58A.

        1. Twenty-five percent of any extra nonresidential floor area shall be gained through the transfer of transferable development rights pursuant to Section 23.50.053.
        2. Seventy-five percent of any extra nonresidential floor area shall be gained as bonus nonresidential floor area pursuant to Section 23.58A.024, or through the transfer of housing TDR under Section 23.50.053, or both.
    2. In an IC 85-160 zone, in addition to satisfying the conditions of subsection 23.50.028.D.1, for development to exceed the base FAR on a lot that has an area of 50,000 square feet or more, the Director shall make an individual determination of project impacts on the need for pedestrian facilities and complete a voluntary agreement between the property owner and the City to mitigate identified impacts, if any. The Director may consider the following as impact mitigation:

        1. Pedestrian walkways on a lot, including through-block connections on through lots, where appropriate, to facilitate pedestrian circulation by connecting structures to each other and abutting streets;
        2. Sidewalk improvements, including sidewalk widening, to accommodate increased pedestrian volumes and streetscape improvements that will enhance pedestrian comfort and safety; and
        3. Measures that will contribute to the improvement of pedestrian facilities, such as the following improvements applicable to the vicinity north of South Royal Brougham Way and south of South Charles Street east of 4 Avenue South:

            1. Improvements to 6 Avenue South as the primary pedestrian and bicycle corridor connecting new development to the surrounding area and transit facilities;
            2. Improvements to facilitate pedestrian wayfinding to and from the Stadium Light Rail Station;
            3. Improvements to enhance the pedestrian environment, such as providing overhead weather protection, landscaping, and other streetscape improvements; and
            4. Improved pedestrian and bicycle crossing of Airport Way South at 6 Avenue South.
    3. In an IC 85-160 zone, in addition to satisfying the conditions of subsections 23.50.028.D.1 and 23.50.028.D.2, if applicable, for development to exceed the base FAR and include 85,000 or more square feet of gross office floor area, the Director shall make an individual determination of project impacts on the need for open space resources. The Director may limit floor area or allow floor area subject to conditions, which may include a voluntary agreement between the property owner and the City to mitigate identified impacts, if any. The Director shall take into account the findings of subsection 23.49.016.A in assessing the demand for open space generated by a typical office project in an area permitting high employment densities.

        1. The Director may consider the following as mitigation for open space impacts:

            1. Open space provided on-site or off-site, consistent with the provisions in subsection 23.49.016.C, or provided through payment in lieu, consistent with subsection 23.49.016.D, except that in all cases the open space shall be located on a lot in an IC 85-160 zone that is accessible to the project occupants, and
            2. Additional pedestrian space through on-site improvements or streetscape improvements provided as mitigation for project impacts on pedestrian facilities pursuant to subsection 23.50.028.D.3.

        1. The transfer of TDR to a receiving lot shall remain effective so long as any portion of any structure for which a permit was issued based upon such transfer remains on the receiving lot; and
        2. The City shall not be required to recognize any return of TDR unless it is demonstrated that all parties in the chain of title have executed, acknowledged and recorded instruments conveying any interest in the TDR back to the sending lot and any lien holders have released any liens thereon.
    6. Any agreement governing the use or development of the sending lot shall provide that its covenants or conditions shall run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by the City of Seattle.
3. Time of determination of TDR Eligible for transfer. The eligibility of a sending lot to transfer TDR, and the amount transferable from a sending lot, shall be determined as of the date of transfer from the sending lot and shall not be affected by the date of any application, permit decision or other action for any project seeking to use such TDR.
4. Use of previously transferred TDR by new projects. Any project using TDR according to applicable limits on TDR in this Section 23.50.053 may use TDR that were transferred from the sending lot consistent with the provisions of this Title 23 in effect at the time of such transfer.
5. Rules. The Director may promulgate rules to implement this Section 23.50.053.

<table>
<tr>
<td>Height of portion of structure</td>
<td>Maximum length of un-modulated façade if less than 15 feet from street lot line</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>65 feet or less</td>
<td>No limit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Greater than 65 feet up to 125 feet</td>
<td>155 feet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Greater than 125 feet</td>
<td>125 feet</td>
</tr>
</table>


1. Any portion of a facade subject to modulation under subsection 23.50.055.B.1.a that exceeds the maximum length of façade prescribed in Table A for 23.50.055 must include a portion set back a minimum depth of 15 feet from street lot lines for a minimum length of 60 feet.
2. Floor area limit. The maximum floor area for any story wholly or in part above 85 feet in height is 25,000 square feet.
3. Minimum separation. At all levels above a height of 85 feet, separate structures on a lot and separate portions of the same structure must be separated at all points by a minimum horizontal distance of 60 feet.

1. Street-facing facade requirements. For purposes of this Section 23.50.055, balcony railings and other non-structural features or non-structural walls are not considered parts of the facade.

    1. Minimum façade height. A minimum façade height of 25 feet is required for facades that face streets shown on Map A for 23.50.016, Industrial Streets Landscaping Plan. The minimum façade height for facades facing other streets is 15 feet. A minimum façade height does not apply if all portions of a structure are lower than the applicable minimum façade height.
    2. Façade setback limits. The total area of street-level setbacks between the street lot line and the street-facing façade is limited to the area determined by multiplying the averaging factor by the width of the structure measured parallel to the abutting street.

        1. The averaging factor is five for facades that face streets shown on Map A for 23.50.016.
        2. For all other street-facing facades, the averaging factor is ten.
        3. The maximum width, measured along the street lot line, of any setback area exceeding a depth of 15 feet from the street lot line is 80 feet, or 30 percent of the lot frontage on that street, whichever is less.
        4. For all lots subject to façade setback limits, the following conditions apply:

            1. Parking is prohibited between the facade and the street lot line.
            2. The maximum setback of the facade from street lot lines within 20 feet of an intersection is 10 feet.
        5. If the presence of a utility easement or other condition requires the street-facing façade to set back from the street lot line, the Director may, as a Type I decision, select another line to apply the standards of subsection 23.50.055.A.2. If sidewalk widening into the lot is required as mitigation pursuant to subsection 23.50.028.D, the setback area permitted by the applicable averaging factor shall be measured from the new edge of the sidewalk within the lot rather than the street lot line.
    3. Principal pedestrian entrances. A principal pedestrian entrance to a structure is required on façades facing streets shown on Map A for 23.50.016, Industrial Streets Landscaping Plan.
    4. Facade transparency requirements. Facade transparency requirements apply to the area of the façade between 2 feet and 8 feet above the sidewalk. Only clear or lightly tinted glass in windows, doors, and display windows is considered to be transparent. Transparent areas shall allow views into the structure or into display windows from the outside.

        1. For facades facing a street shown on Map A for 23.50.016, Industrial Streets Landscaping Plan, a minimum of 60 percent of a street-facing facade shall be transparent.
        2. For facades facing all other streets, a minimum of 40 percent of the street-facing facade shall be transparent.
2. Upper Level Development Standards.

    1. Facade Modulation.

        1. For structures exceeding 85 feet in height, modulation is required for the portion of a street-facing facade above 65 feet in height if any part of the façade above that height is located less than 15 feet from street lot lines. No modulation is required for portions of a facade set back 15 feet or more from street lot lines.
        2. For portions of structures subject to the modulation requirements of subsection 23.50.055.B, the maximum length of a street-facing facade without modulation is prescribed in Table A for 23.50.055. For purposes of this subsection 23.50.055.B, length is measured parallel to each street lot line, and includes projections from the street-facing façade, such as balconies, within 15 feet of street lot lines or their projection.

The public facility use shall be developed according to the development standards for institutions (Section 23.44.022), unless the City Council makes a determination to waive or modify applicable development standards according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Subchapter III, Council Land Use Decisions, with public projects considered as Type IV quasi-judicial decisions and City facilities considered as Type V legislative decisions.


1. Except as provided in subsections B, D and E of this Section 23.51A.002, uses in public facilities that are most similar to uses permitted outright or permitted as an administrative conditional use under Chapter 23.44 are also permitted outright or as an administrative conditional use, subject to the same use regulations, development standards and administrative conditional use criteria that govern the similar use. The City Council may waive or modify applicable development standards or administrative conditional use criteria according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Subchapter III, Council Land Use Decisions, with public projects considered as Type IV quasi-judicial decisions and City facilities considered as Type V legislative decisions.
2. Permitted Uses in Public Facilities Requiring City Council Approval. The following uses in public facilities in single-family zones may be permitted by the City Council, according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions:

    1. Police precinct station;
    2. Fire station;
    3. Public boat moorage;
    4. Utility services use; and
    5. Other similar use.
3. Expansion of Uses in Public Facilities.

    1. Major Expansion. Major expansions may be permitted to uses in public facilities allowed in subsections 23.51A.002.A and B above according to the same provisions and procedural requirements as described in these subsections. A major expansion of a public facility use occurs when the proposed expansion would not meet development standards or would exceed either 750 square feet or 10 percent of its existing area, whichever is greater, including gross floor area and areas devoted to active outdoor uses other than parking.
    2. Minor Expansion. When an expansion falls below the major expansion threshold level, it is a minor expansion. Minor expansions may be permitted to uses in public facilities allowed in subsections 23.51A.002.A and B above according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, for a Type I Master Use Permit when the development standards of the zone in which the public facility is located are met.
4. Sewage Treatment Plants. The expansion or reconfiguration (which term shall include reconstruction, redevelopment, relocation on the site, or intensification of treatment capacity) of existing sewage treatment plants in single-family zones may be permitted if there is no feasible alternative location in a zone where the use is permitted and the conditions imposed under subsections 23.51A.002.D.3 and D4 are met.

    1. Applicable Procedures. The decision on an application for the expansion or reconfiguration of a sewage treatment plant is a Type IV Council land use decision. If an application for an early determination of feasibility is required to be filed pursuant to subsection D2 of this section 23.51A.002, the early determination of feasibility will also be a Council land use decision subject to Sections 23.76.038 through 23.76.056.
    2. Need for Feasible Alternative Determination. The proponent shall demonstrate that there is no feasible alternative location in a zone where establishment of the use is permitted.

        1. The Council's decision as to the feasibility of alternative location(s) shall be based upon a full consideration of the environmental, social and economic impacts on the community, and the intent to preserve and to protect the physical character of single-family areas, and to protect single-family areas from intrusions of non-single- family uses.
        2. The determination of feasibility may be the subject of a separate application for a Council land use decision prior to submission of an application for a project-specific approval if the Director determines that the expansion or reconfiguration proposal is complex, involves the phasing of programmatic and project-specific decisions or affects more than one site in a single-family zone.
        3. Application for an early determination of feasibility shall include:

            1. The scope and intent of the proposed project in the single-family zone and appropriate alternative(s) in zones where establishment of the use is permitted, identified by the applicant or the Director;
            2. The necessary environmental documentation as determined by the Director, including an assessment of the impacts of the proposed project and of the permitted-zone alternative(s), according to the state and local SEPA guidelines;
            3. Information on the overall sewage treatment system that outlines the interrelationship of facilities in single-family zones and in zones where establishment of the use is permitted;
            4. Schematic plans outlining dimensions, elevations, locations on site and similar specifications for the proposed project and for the alternative(s).
        4. If a proposal or any portion of a proposal is also subject to a feasible or reasonable alternative location determination under Section 23.60.066, the Plan Shoreline Permit application and the early determination application will be considered in one determination process.
    3. Conditions for Approval of Proposal.

        1. The project is located so that adverse impacts on residential areas are minimized;
        2. The expansion of a facility does not result in a concentration of institutions or facilities that would create or appreciably aggravate impacts that are incompatible with single- family residences.
        3. A facility management and transportation plan is required. The level and kind of detail to be disclosed in the plan shall be based on the probable impacts and/or scale of the proposed facility, and shall at a minimum include discussion of sludge transportation, noise control, and hours of operation. Increased traffic and parking expected to occur with use of the facility shall not create a serious safety problem or a blighting influence on the neighborhood;
        4. Measures to minimize potential odor emission and airborne pollutants including methane shall meet standards of and be consistent with best available technology as determined in consultation with the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA), and shall be incorporated into the design and operation of the facility;
        5. Methods of storing and transporting chlorine and other hazardous and potentially hazardous chemicals shall be determined in consultation with the Seattle Fire Department and incorporated into the design and operation of the facility;
        6. Vehicular access suitable for trucks is available or provided from the plant to a designated arterial improved to City standards;
        7. The bulk of facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding community. Public facilities that do not meet bulk requirements may be located in single-family residential areas if there is a public necessity for their location there;
        8. Landscaping and screening, separation from less intensive zones, noise, light and glare controls and other measures to ensure the compatibility of the use with the surrounding area and to mitigate adverse impacts shall be incorporated into the design and operation of the facility.
        9. No residential structures, including those modified for nonresidential use, are demolished for facility expansion unless a need has been demonstrated for the services of the institution or facility in the surrounding community.
    4. Substantial Conformance. If the application for a project-specific proposal is submitted after an early determination that location of the sewage treatment plant is not feasible in a zone where establishment of the use is permitted, the proposed project must be in substantial conformance with the feasibility determination. Substantial conformance shall include, but not be limited to, a determination that:

        1. There is no net substantial increase in the environmental impacts of the project-specific proposal as compared to the impacts of the proposal as approved in the feasibility determination.
        2. Conditions included in the feasibility determination are met.
5. Prohibited Uses. The following public facilities are prohibited in single-family zones:

    1. Jails;
    2. Metro operating bases;
    3. Park and ride lots;
    4. Establishment of new sewage treatment plants;
    5. Solid waste transfer stations;
    6. Animal control shelters;
    7. Post Office distribution centers; and
    8. Work-release centers.
6. Essential Public Facilities. Permitted essential public facilities shall also be reviewed according to the provisions of Chapter 23.80, Essential Public Facilities.

#### 23.51A.004 - Public facilities in multifamily zones

1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 23.51A.004.D, uses in public facilities that are most similar to uses permitted outright or permitted as an administrative conditional use under the applicable zoning are also permitted outright or as an administrative conditional use, subject to the same use regulations, development standards and administrative conditional use criteria that govern the similar use.
2. The following uses in public facilities are permitted outright in all multifamily zones if the development standards for institutions in Section 23.45.570, other than dispersion requirements, are met, except as otherwise provided in subsection 23.51A.004.B.6:

    1. Police precinct stations;
    2. Fire stations;
    3. Public boat moorages;
    4. Utility service uses;
    5. Other uses similar to any of the uses listed in this subsection 23.51A.004.B; and
    6. Youth service centers existing as of January 1, 2013, in public facilities operated by King County in an LR3 zone within an Urban Center Village and replacement, additions or expansions to such King County public facilities. For youth service centers, the development standards for institutions in Section 23.45.570 apply, and subsections 23.45.570.D and 23.45.570.F relating to structure width and setbacks may be waived or modified by the Director as a Type II decision. The Director's decision to waive or modify standards shall be based on a finding that the waiver or modification is needed to accommodate unique programming, public service delivery, or structural needs of the facility and that the following urban design objectives are met. The Director's decision shall include conditions to mitigate all substantial impacts caused by such a waiver or modification.

        1. Objective 1: Create visual interest along and activate each street frontage. Examples for achieving this objective include, but are not limited to, the following:

            1. Incorporate prominent entrances and other features that welcome pedestrians;
            2. Add visual interest using architectural detailing of the facade, transparency, decorative materials or design features;
            3. Use signage consistent with the Sign Code, Chapter 23.55, that helps orient pedestrians and adds interest to the street environment.
        2. Objective 2: Create a continuous pedestrian environment along each frontage of the development in LR3. Examples for achieving this objective include, but are not limited to, the following:

            1. Incorporate shade and rain protection, such as awnings, building overhangs, benches, freestanding pavilions or kiosks;
            2. Where site dimensions and program conditions allow, provide a landscaped setback between the structure and sidewalk;
            3. Design new or existing bus stops to integrate transit shelters, benches and decorative treatments with the adjacent facade.
        3. Objective 3: Address the bulk and scale of the building by design treatments that transition to the scale of nearby development. Examples for achieving this objective include, but are not limited to, the following:

            1. Break down the apparent scale of the building and reduce the impact of blank walls by using modulation or decorative facade elements, such as material, shape, color, architectural detailing, painting, screening, artwork, or vegetated walls;
            2. Use landscaped setbacks where appropriate.
3. Unless specifically prohibited in subsection 23.51A.004.D, uses in new public facilities not specifically listed in subsection 23.51A.004.B or permitted pursuant to subsection 23.51A.004.A, or that are listed in or permitted pursuant to subsections 23.51A.004.A or 23.51A.004.B but do not meet applicable development standards or administrative conditional use criteria, may be permitted by the City Council according to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, with public projects considered as Type IV quasijudicial decisions and City facilities considered as Type V legislative decisions. In making the decision, the Council may waive or grant departures from development standards or administrative conditional use criteria for public facilities, if the following criteria are satisfied:

    1. The location of the public facility addresses public service needs, and any waiver or departure from development standards or administrative conditional use criteria is necessitated by those public service delivery needs; and
    2. The impact of the public facility on surrounding properties has been addressed in the design, siting, landscaping and screening of the facility.
4. The following public facilities are prohibited in all multifamily zones:

    1. Jails, except for youth service centers existing as of January 1, 2013, in public facilities operated by King County within an Urban Center Village;
    2. Work-release centers;
    3. Bus bases;
    4. Park and ride lots;
    5. Sewage treatment plants;
    6. Animal control shelters; and
    7. Post office distribution centers.
5. Expansion of uses in public facilities

    1. Major expansion. Major expansion of public facilities that are permitted by subsection 23.51A.004.C may be approved by the City Council, with public projects considered as Type IV quasi-judicial decisions and City facilities considered as Type V land use decisions, subject to the criteria of subsections 23.51A.004.C.1 and 23.51A.004.C.2. A major expansion of a public facility occurs if an expansion would not meet development standards or, except for expansion of the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, the area of the expansion would exceed either 750 square feet or 10 percent of the existing area of the use, whichever is greater. A major expansion of the Washington State Convention and Trade Center is one that is 12,000 square feet or more in size. For the purposes of this subsection 23.51A.004.E.1, "area of the use" includes gross floor area and outdoor area devoted actively to that use, excluding parking.
    2. Minor expansion. An expansion of a public facility that is not a major expansion is a minor expansion. Minor expansions to uses in public facilities that are permitted by subsections 23.51A.004.A, 23.51A.004.B, or 23.51A.004.C are permitted outright.
6. Essential public facilities will be reviewed according to the provisions of Chapter 23.80, Essential Public Facilities.
7. Uses in existing or former public schools

    1. Child-care centers, preschools, public or private schools, educational and vocational training for the disabled, adult evening education classes, nonprofit libraries, community centers, community programs for the elderly, and similar uses are permitted in existing or former public schools.
    2. Other non-school uses are permitted in existing or former public schools pursuant to procedures established in Chapter 23.78, Establishment of Criteria for Joint Use or Reuse of Schools.

1. Departures from setback requirements may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter 23.79 as follows:

    1. The minimum average setback may be reduced to 10 feet and the minimum setback to 5 feet for structures or portions of structures across a street or alley from lots in residential zones.
    2. The minimum average setback may be reduced to 15 feet and the minimum setback to 5 feet for structures or portions of structures abutting lots in residential zones.
    3. The limits in subsections E.5.a and E.5.b of this Section 23.51B.002 may be waived by the Director if a waiver would contribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.

1. New public schools or additions to existing public schools and accessory uses including child care centers that meet the applicable development standards of this Chapter 23.51B are permitted outright.
2. Departures from development standards may be permitted or required pursuant to procedures and criteria established in Chapter 23.79, Establishment of Development Standard Departure for Public Schools.
3. Lot Coverage in Single Family Zones

    1. For new public school construction on new public school sites the maximum lot coverage permitted for all structures is 45 percent of the lot area for one story structures or 35 percent of the lot area if any structure or portion of a structure has more than one story.
    2. For new public school construction and additions to existing public school structures on existing public school sites, the maximum lot coverage permitted is the greater of the following:

        1. The lot coverage permitted in subsection 23.51B.002.C.1; or
        2. The lot coverage of the former school structures on the site, provided that the height of the new structure or portion of structure is no greater than that of the former structures when measured according to Section 23.86.006.F, and at least 50 percent of the footprint of the new principal structure is constructed on a portion of the lot formerly occupied by the footprint of the former principal structure.
    3. Departures from lot coverage limits may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter 23.79. Up to 55 percent lot coverage may be allowed for single-story structures, and up to 45 percent lot coverage for structures of more than one story. Lot coverage restrictions may be waived by the Director as a Type I decision when waiver would contribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.
    4. The exceptions to lot coverage set forth in subsection 23.44.010.D apply.
4. Height

    1. Single Family and Lowrise Zones

        1. For new public school construction on new public school sites, the maximum permitted height is 30 feet plus 5 feet for a pitched roof. For gymnasiums and auditoriums that are accessory to the public school, the maximum permitted height is 35 feet plus 10 feet for a pitched roof if all portions of the structure above 30 feet are set back at least 20 feet from all lot lines. All parts of a pitched roof above the height limit must be pitched at a rate of not less than 4:12. No portion of a shed roof on a gymnasium or auditorium is permitted to extend above the 35 foot height limit under this provision.
        2. For new public school construction on existing public school sites, the maximum permitted height is 35 feet plus 15 feet for a pitched roof. All parts of the roof above the height limit must be pitched at a rate of not less than 4:12. No portion of a shed roof is permitted to extend beyond the 35 foot height limit under this provision.
        3. For additions to existing public schools on existing public school sites, the maximum height permitted is the height of the existing school or 35 feet plus 15 feet for a pitched roof, whichever is greater. When the height limit is 35 feet, the ridge of the pitched roof on a principal structure may extend up to 15 feet above the height limit, and all parts of the roof above the height limit must be pitched at a rate of not less than 4:12. No portion of a shed roof is permitted to extend beyond the 35 foot limit under this provision.
    2. Midrise and Highrise Zones. The maximum permitted height for any public school located in a MR or HR zone is the base height permitted in that zone for multifamily structures.
    3. In Lowrise zones, departures from height limits may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter 23.79. For construction of new structures on new and existing public school sites to the extent not otherwise permitted outright, the maximum height that may be granted as a development standard departure is 35 feet plus 15 feet for a roof pitched at a rate of not less than 4:12 for elementary schools and 60 feet plus 15 feet for a roof pitched at a rate of not less than 4:12 for secondary schools. No departures may be granted for a portion of a shed roof to extend beyond 35 feet in height under this provision.
    4. Height maximums in all residential zones may be waived by the Director as a Type I decision when the waiver would contribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.
    5. The provisions of subsection B of Section 23.44.012 and the exemptions of subsection C of Section 23.44.012 apply.
    6. Light Standards

        1. Light standards for illumination of athletic fields on new and existing public school sites may be allowed to exceed the maximum permitted height, up to a maximum height of 100 feet, if the Director determines that the additional height is necessary to ensure adequate illumination and that impacts from light and glare are minimized to the greatest extent practicable. The applicant must submit an engineer's report demonstrating that impacts from light and glare are minimized to the greatest extent practicable. When proposed light standards are reviewed as part of a project being reviewed pursuant to Chapter 25.05, Environmental Policies and Procedures, and requiring a SEPA determination, the applicant must demonstrate that the additional height contributes to a reduction in impacts from light and glare.
        2. When proposed light standards are not included in a proposal being reviewed pursuant to Chapter 25.05, the Director may permit the additional height as a special exception subject to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions.

            1. When seeking a special exception for taller light standards, the applicant must submit an engineer's report demonstrating that the additional height contributes to a reduction in impacts from light and glare. When the proposal will result in extending the lighted area's duration of use, the applicant must address and mitigate potential impacts, including but not limited to, increased duration of noise, traffic, and parking demand. The applicant also shall conduct a public workshop for residents within 1/8 of a mile of the affected school in order to solicit comments and suggestions on design as well as potential impacts.
            2. The Director may condition a special exception to address negative impacts from light and glare on surrounding areas, and conditions may also be imposed to address other impacts associated with increased field use due to the addition of lights, including, but not limited to, increased noise, traffic, and parking demand.
5. Setbacks

    1. General Requirements

        1. No setbacks are required for new public school construction or for additions to existing public school structures for that portion of the site across a street or an alley or abutting a lot in a nonresidential zone. If any portion of the site is across a street or an alley from or abuts a lot in a residential zone, setbacks are required for areas facing or abutting residential zones, as provided in subsections E.2 through E.5 of this Section 23.51B.002. Setbacks for sites across a street or alley from or abutting lots in Residential-Commercial (RC) zones are based upon the residential zone classification of the RC lot.
        2. The minimum setback requirement may be averaged along the structure facade with absolute minimums for areas abutting lots in residential zones as provided in subsections E.2.b, E.3.b and E.4.b of this Section 23.51B.002.
        3. Trash disposals, operable windows in a gymnasium, main entrances, play equipment, kitchen ventilators or other similar items shall be located at least 30 feet from any single-family zoned lot and 20 feet from any multi-family zoned lot.
        4. The exceptions of subsections 23.44.014.D.5, D.6, D.7, D.8, D.9, D.10, D.11 and D.12 apply.
    2. New public school construction on new public school sites.

        1. New public school construction on new public school sites across a street or alley from lots in residential zones shall provide minimum setbacks according to the height of the school and the designation of the facing residential zone, as shown in Table A for 23.51B.002:
6. New public school construction on new public school sites abutting lots in residential zones shall provide minimum setbacks according to the height of the school and the designation of the abutting residential zone, as shown in Table B for 23.51B.002:
7. Structure Width.

    1. When a new public school structure is built on a new public school site or on an existing public school site, the maximum width of a structure is 66 feet unless either the modulation option in subsection F.1.a below or the landscape option in subsection 23.51B.002.F.1.b below is met.

        1. Modulation Option. Facades shall be modulated according to the following provisions:

            1. The minimum depth of modulation is 4 feet.
            2. The minimum width of modulation is 20 percent of the total structure width or 10 feet, whichever is greater.
        2. Landscape Option. The yards provided by the required setbacks shall be landscaped as follows:

            1. One tree and three shrubs are required for each 300 square feet of required yard.
            2. Trees and shrubs that already exist in the required planting area or have their trunk or center within 10 feet of the area may be substituted for required plantings on a one-tree-to-one-tree or one-shrub- to-one-shrub basis. In order to qualify, a tree must be 6 inches or greater in diameter, measured 4.5 feet above the ground.
            3. The planting of street trees may be substituted for required trees on a one-to-one basis. All street trees shall be planted according to City of Seattle tree planting standards.
            4. Each setback required to be landscaped shall be planted with shrubs, grass, and/or evergreen ground cover.
            5. Landscape features such as decorative paving are permitted to a maximum of 25 percent of each required landscaped area.
            6. A plan shall be filed showing the layout of the required landscaping.
            7. The School District shall maintain all landscape material and replace any dead or dying plants.
    2. There is no maximum width limit for additions to existing public school structures on existing public school sites. The Director may require landscaping to reduce the appearance of bulk.
    3. Departures from the modulation and landscaping standards may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter 23.79 to permit other techniques to reduce the appearance of bulk. Techniques to reduce the appearance of bulk may be waived by the Director as a Type I decision when the waiver would contribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.
8. Parking Quantity. Parking shall be required as provided in Chapter 23.54.
9. Parking Location. Parking may be located:

    1. Within the principal structure; or
    2. On any portion of the lot except the front setback, provided that the parking is separated from streets and from abutting lots in residential zones by an area with a minimum depth of 5 feet that is landscaped with trees and ground cover determined by the Director, as a Type I decision, as adequate to soften the view of the parking from adjacent properties. In the case of a through lot, parking may also be located in one front setback when landscaped as described in this subsection;
    3. Departures may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures set forth in Chapter 23.79 to permit parking location anywhere on the lot and to reduce required landscaping. Landscaping may be waived in whole or in part if the topography of the site or other circumstances result in the purposes of landscaping being served, as, for example, when a steep slope shields parking from the view of abutting properties. This test may be waived by the Director, as a Type I decision, when waiver would contribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.
10. Bus and Truck Loading and Unloading.

    1. Unless subsection I.4 of this section 23.51B.002 applies, an off-street bus loading and unloading area of a size reasonable to meet the needs of the school shall be provided and may be located in any required yard. The bus loading and unloading area may be permitted in landscaped areas provided under subsection 23.51B.002.F.1.b if the Director determines that landscaping around the loading and unloading area softens the impacts of its appearance on abutting properties.
    2. One off-street truck loading berth that is 13 feet wide and 40 feet long is required for new public school construction.
    3. Departures from the requirements and standards for bus and truck loading and unloading areas and berths may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter 23.79 only when departure would contribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.
    4. When a public school is remodeled or rebuilt at the same site, an existing on-street bus loading area is allowed if the following conditions are met:

        1. The school site is not proposed to be expanded;
        2. The student capacity of the school is not being expanded by more than 25 percent; and
        3. The location of the current on-street bus loading remains the same.
11. Noise, Odor, Light and Glare. The development standards for small institutions set forth in Section 23.45.570 apply. Departures from these standards may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter 23.79 only when departure would contribute to reduced demolition of residential structures.


### Chapter 23.52 - TRANSPORTATION CONCURRENCY, AND TRANSPORTATION IMPACT MITIGATION

Sections:

#### Subchapter I - Transportation Concurrency Project Review System
##### 23.52.002 - Categorical exemptions

Construction of a new structure and/or parking lot, expansion of an existing structure and/or parking lot, and/or changes of use that are categorically exempt from SEPA review under Chapter 25.05 are exempt from Subchapter I of this Chapter 23.52. Projects that are categorically exempt from SEPA review but are otherwise subject to SEPA due to their location within an environmentally critical area are exempt from this Chapter 23.52.


##### 23.52.004 - Requirement to meet transportation concurrency level-of-service standards

Unless exempt under Section 23.52.002, a proposed use or development must demonstrate that the traffic forecasted to be generated by the use or development will not cause the transportation concurrency level-of-service (LOS) at an applicable screenline, measured as the volume-to-capacity ratio (v/c), to exceed the LOS standard for that screenline. The v/c methodology is adopted by Director's Rule promulgated under the authority of the Director of DPD. Screenlines are shown in Map A for 23.52.004. LOS standards for those screenlines are shown in Table A for 23.52.004. "Applicable screenlines" means up to four of the screenlines shown in Map A for 23.52.004 as specified for a particular proposed use or development by the Director.

##### 23.52.006 - Effect of not meeting transportation concurrency LOS standards.

If a proposed use or development does not meet the LOS standards at one (1) or more applicable screenline(s), the proposed use or development may be approved if the Director concludes that an improvement(s) will be completed and/or a strategy(ies) will be implemented that will result in the proposed use or development meeting the LOS standard(s) at all applicable screenline(s) at the time of development, or that a financial commitment is in place to complete the improvement(s) and/or implement the strategy(ies) within six (6) years. Eligible improvements or strategies may be funded by the City, by other government agencies, by the applicant, or by another person or entity.



#### Subchapter II - Transportation Impact Mitigation
##### 23.52.008 - Transportation impact mitigation

For all other development the Director shall determine the scope and level of detail of analysis based on the probable impacts and/or scale of the proposed development. The analysis may include the elements identified above or other elements as determined by the Director.


1. Applicability. The requirements of this Section 23.52.008 apply to proposed new development as described in Table A for 23.52.008. Proposed new development that is subject to SEPA environmental review per Chapter 25.05 is exempt from Subchapter II of this Chapter 23.52.
2. Impact analysis required. Applicants for proposed development shall prepare and submit with the development permit application an analysis of potential transportation impacts that may result from the proposed development. For development containing more than 50 dwelling units or 12,000 square feet of non-residential floor area or both, the analysis must contain the following information and analysis:

    1. Number of additional daily and peak hour vehicular trips;
    2. Likely distribution of project traffic and effects on traffic operations;
    3. Availability and expected usage of transit;
    4. Existing vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle conditions, including access and connections to transit and bicycle facilities; and
    5. Accident history.
3. Impact mitigation. Based upon the results of the transportation impact analysis the Director may condition permit approval, as a Type I decision, to mitigate or prevent transportation impacts.

    1. Except as provided by subsection 23.52.008.C.2, required mitigation may include, but is not limited to:

        1. changes in access;
        2. changes in the location, number and size of curb cuts and driveways;
        3. provision of transit incentives, including transit pass subsidies;
        4. bicycle parking, and shower facilities for bicycle commuters;
        5. signage, including wayfinding;
        6. improvements to vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle traffic facilities or operations including signalization, turn channelization, right-of-way dedication, street widening, pedestrian and bicycle facilities improvements, and lighting;
        7. transportation management plans;
        8. parking management strategies including, but not limited to, unbundling parking from building-space leases, reserved parking spaces for vanpools, and reduction in the amount of parking to be provided; and
        9. participation in a transportation mitigation payment program or transportation management association, where available.
    2. Mitigation that may be required for residential projects in downtown zones or the residential portion of mixed use projects in downtown zones is limited to:

        1. signage, including wayfinding;
        2. provision of information on transit and ride-sharing programs; and
        3. bicycle parking.



### Chapter 23.53 - REQUIREMENTS FOR STREETS, ALLEYS, AND EASEMENTS

Sections:

#### 23.53.004 - Requirements and design criteria

Where, because of specific site conditions, the requirements of this Chapter 23.53 do not protect public health, safety, and welfare, the Director of Transportation and the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections together may impose different or additional right-of-way improvement requirements consistent with the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual.


#### 23.53.005 - Access to lots

1. Street or private easement abutment required

    1. For residential uses, at least 10 feet of a lot line shall abut a street or a private permanent vehicle access easement meeting the standards of Section 23.53.025, or the provisions of subsection 23.53.025.F for pedestrian access easements shall be met.
    2. For non-residential uses that do not provide parking, at least 5 feet of a lot line shall abut a street or a private permanent vehicle access easement meeting the standards of Section 23.53.025, or the provisions of subsection 23.53.025.F for pedestrian access easements to residential uses shall be met.
    3. For non-residential uses and live-work units that provide parking, an amount of lot line sufficient to provide the required driveway width shall abut a street, or an alley improved to the standards of Section 23.53.030; or a private permanent vehicle access easement to a street meeting the standards of Section 23.53.025. If no vehicular access is required or provided, then pedestrian access meeting the provisions of subsection 23.53.025.F for pedestrian access easements to residential uses shall be met.
2. New Easements. When a new private easement is proposed for vehicular access to a lot, the Director may instead require access by a street when one (1) or more of the following conditions exist:

    1. Where access by easement would compromise the goals of the Land Use Code to provide for adequate light, air and usable open space between structures;
    2. If the improvement of a dedicated street is necessary or desirable to facilitate adequate water supply for domestic water purposes or for fire protection, or to facilitate adequate storm drainage;
    3. If improvement of a dedicated street is necessary or desirable in order to provide on-street parking for overflow conditions;
    4. Where it is demonstrated that potential safety hazards would result from multiple access points between existing and future developments onto a roadway without curbs and with limited sight lines;
    5. If the dedication and improvement of a street would provide better and/or more identifiable access for the public or for emergency vehicles; or
    6. Where a potential exists for extending the street system.

#### 23.53.006 - Pedestrian access and circulation

1. General requirements. Pedestrian access and circulation are required on all streets in all zones as set forth in this Section 23.53.006. Pedestrian access and circulation improvements shall meet the standards in the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual for sidewalks and pedestrian walkways. The regulations in this Section 23.53.006 are not intended to preclude the use of Chapter 25.05, the Seattle SEPA Rules, to mitigate adverse environmental impacts.
2. Dedication of New Streets. Sidewalks and curbs are required when new streets are dedicated.
3. Within urban centers and urban villages. Within urban centers and urban villages, sidewalks are required whenever new lots are created through the platting process, including full and short subdivisions and unit lot subdivisions, or whenever development is proposed that abuts any existing street without a sidewalk, in any zone, except as specified in subsection 23.53.006.F.
4. Outside Urban Centers and Urban Villages. Outside of Urban Centers and Urban Villages, sidewalks are required on an existing street in any of the following circumstances, except as provided in subsection 23.53.006.F

    1. In any zone with a pedestrian designation, sidewalks are required if new lots are created through the platting process including full and short subdivisions and unit lot subdivisions, and if development is proposed.
    2. On streets designated on Map A for 23.50.016, sidewalks are required if new lots are created through the platting process, including full and short subdivisions and unit lot subdivisions, and if development is proposed. Sidewalks are required only for the portion of the lot that abuts the designated street.
    3. On arterials, except in IG1 and IG2 zones and on lots in IB zones that are not directly across the street from or abutting a lot in a residential or commercial zone, sidewalks are required if new lots are created through the platting process, including full and short subdivisions and unit lot subdivisions, and if development is proposed. Sidewalks are required only for the portion of the lot that abuts the arterial.
    4. In SF and LR1 zones, sidewalks are required if ten or more lots are created through the platting process, including full and short subdivisions and unit lot subdivisions, or if ten or more dwelling units are developed.
    5. Outside of SF and LR1 zones, except in IG1 and IG2 zones and on lots in IB zones that are not directly across the street from or abutting lot in a residential or commercial zone, sidewalks are required if six or more lots are created through the platting process, including full and short subdivisions and unit lot subdivisions, or if six or more dwelling units are developed.
    6. In all zones, except IG1 and IG2 zones and on lots in IB zones that are not directly across the street from or abutting a lot in a residential or commercial zone, sidewalks are required if the following nonresidential uses are developed:

        1. 750 square feet or more of gross floor area of major and minor vehicle repair uses and multipurpose retail sales; or
        2. 4,000 square feet or more of nonresidential uses not listed in subsection 23.53.006.D.6.a.
5. Requirements for Pedestrian Walkways in Certain Industrial Zones. In IG1 and IG2 zones, and on lots in IB zones that are not directly across the street from or abutting lot in a residential or commercial zone, whenever development is proposed on existing streets that do not have curbs, a pedestrian walkway is required, except as provided in subsection 23.53.006.F.
6. Exceptions. The following exceptions to pedestrian access and circulation requirements and standards apply:

    1. Projects exempt from requirements. Pedestrian access and circulation improvements are not required for the following types of projects:

        1. changes of use;
        2. alterations to existing structures;
        3. additions to existing structures that are exempt from environmental review;
        4. construction of a detached structure accessory to a single-family dwelling unit located in any zone, if the property owner enters into a no-protest agreement, as authorized by RCW 35.43, to future pedestrian access and circulation improvements and that agreement is recorded with the King County Recorder;
        5. construction of a single-family dwelling unit on a lot in any zone, if the property owner enters into a no-protest agreement, as authorized by RCW 35.43, to future pedestrian access and circulation improvements and that agreement is recorded with the King County Recorder, and if at least one of the following conditions is met:

            1. the lot is located on a block front where there are no existing pedestrian access and circulation improvements within 100 feet of the lot; or
            2. construction of pedestrian access and circulation improvements is not necessary because, for example, the existing right-of-way has suitable width and surface treatment for pedestrian use; or the existing right-of-way has a limited amount of existing and potential vehicular traffic; or the Director anticipates limited, if any, additional development near the lot because the development near the lot is at or near zoned capacity under current zoning designations.
        6. expansions of surface parking, outdoor storage, outdoor sales and outdoor display of rental equipment of less than 20 percent of the parking, storage, sales or display area, or number of parking spaces;
        7. in IG1 and IG2 zones, and on lots in IB zones that are not directly across the street from or abutting a lot in a residential or commercial zone, the addition of:

            1. fewer than ten artist's studio dwellings;
            2. less than 750 square feet of gross floor area of major and minor vehicle repair uses and multipurpose retail sales; and
            3. Less than 4,000 square feet of gross floor area of non-residential uses not listed in subsection 23.53.006.F.1.g.2; and
        8. construction of a new non-residential structure of up to 4,000 square feet of gross floor area if the structure is at least 50 feet from any lot line abutting an existing street that does not have pedestrian access and circulation improvements.
    2. Waiver or Modification of Pedestrian Access and Circulation Requirements.

        1. The Director, in consultation with the Director of Transportation, may waive or modify pedestrian access and circulation requirements when one or more of the following conditions are met. The waiver or modification shall provide the minimum relief necessary to accommodate site conditions while maximizing pedestrian access and circulation.

            1. Location in an environmentally critical area or buffer makes installation of a sidewalk impractical or undesirable;
            2. The existence of a bridge, viaduct or structure such as a substantial retaining wall in proximity to the project site makes installation of a sidewalk impractical or undesirable;
            3. Sidewalk construction would result in undesirable disruption of existing drainage patterns, or disturbance to or removal of natural features such as significant trees or other valuable and character-defining mature vegetation; or
            4. Sidewalk construction would preclude vehicular access to the lot, for example on project sites where topography would render driveway access in excess of the maximum 20 percent slope.
    3. Deviation from Sidewalk Standards. The Director of Transportation may grant a deviation from sidewalk standards specified in the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual through the Deviation Request Process in order to address environmental and sustainability issues through the use of an alternative sidewalk design and/or materials.
    4. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 23.76.026, the applicant for a Master Use Permit or a building permit to which the Land Use Code in effect prior to the effective date of the ordinance enacting this subsection F.4 applies may, by written election, use the exemptions in subsections 23.53.006.F.1, F.2, and F.3.

4. Exceptions

    1. Streets with existing curbs

        1. Streets with right-of-way greater than or equal to the minimum right-of-way width. If a street with existing curbs abuts a lot and the existing right-of-way is greater than or equal to the minimum width established in subsection 23.53.015.A.6, but the roadway width is less than the minimum established in the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual, the following requirements shall be met:

            1. All structures on the lot shall be designed and built to accommodate the grade of the future street improvements.
            2. A no-protest agreement to future street improvements is required, as authorized by chapter 35.43 RCW. The agreement shall be recorded with the King County Recorder.
            3. Pedestrian access and circulation is required as specified in Section 23.53.006.
        2. Streets with less than the minimum right-of-way width. If a street with existing curbs abuts a lot and the existing right-of-way is less than the minimum width established in subsection 23.53.015.A.6, the following requirements shall be met:

            1. Setback requirement. A setback equal to half the difference between the current right-of-way width and the minimum right-of-way width established in subsection 23.53.015.A.6 is required; provided, however, that if a setback has been provided under this provision, other lots on the block shall provide the same setback. In all residential zones except Highrise zones, an additional 3 foot setback is also required. The area of the setback may be used to meet any development standard, except that required parking may not be located in the setback. Underground structures that would not prevent the future widening and improvement of the right-of-way may be permitted in the required setback by the Director after consulting with the Director of Transportation. Encroachments into this setback shall not be considered structural building overhangs, but the encroachment is limited to the standards set forth in Section 23.53.035.
            2. Grading requirement. If a setback is required, all structures on the lot shall be designed and built to accommodate the grade of the future street, as specified in the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual.

            2. All structures on the lot(s) shall be designed and built to accommodate the grade of the future street improvements.
            3. A no-protest agreement to future street improvements is required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the King County Recorder.
            4. Pedestrian access and circulation is required as specified in by Section 23.53.006.
        2. Other projects with reduced requirements. The types of projects listed in this subsection 23.53.015.D.2.b are exempt from right-of-way dedication requirements and are subject to the street improvement requirements of this subsection 23.53.015.D.2.b, except as waived or modified pursuant to subsection 23.53.015.D.3:

            1. Types of projects.

                1. Proposed developments that contain more than two but fewer than ten units in SF, RSL, and LR1 zones, or fewer than six residential units in all other zones, or proposed short plats in which no more than two additional lots are proposed to be created, except as provided in Section 23.53.015.D.2.a;
                2. The following uses if they are smaller than 750 square feet of gross floor area: major and minor vehicle repair uses, and multipurpose retail sales uses;
                3. Non-residential structures that have less than 4,000 square feet of gross floor area and that do not contain uses listed in subsection 23.53.015.D.2.b.1.b that are larger than 750 square feet;
                4. Structures containing a mix of residential uses and either nonresidential uses or live-work units, if there are fewer than ten units in SF, RSL, and LR1 zones, or fewer than six residential units in all other zones, and the square footage of nonresidential use is less than specified in subsections 23.53.D.2.b.1).b) and D.2.b.1).c);
                5. Remodeling and use changes within existing structures;
                6. Additions to existing structures that are exempt from environmental review; and
                7. Expansions of surface parking, outdoor storage, outdoor sales or outdoor display of rental equipment of less than 20 percent of the parking, storage, sales or display area or number of parking spaces.
            2. Paving requirement. For the types of projects listed in subsection 23.53.015.D.2.b.1, the streets abutting the lot shall have a hard-surfaced roadway at least 18 feet wide. If there is not an 18 foot wide hard-surfaced roadway, the roadway shall be paved to a width of at least 20 feet from the lot to the nearest hard-surfaced street meeting this requirement, or 100 feet, whichever is less. Streets that form a dead end at the property to be developed shall be improved with a cul-de-sac or other vehicular turnaround as specified in the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual. As a Type 1 decision, the Director, after consulting with the Director of Transportation, shall determine whether the street has the potential for being extended or whether it forms a dead end because of topography and/or the layout of the street system.
            3. Other requirements. The requirements of subsection 23.53.015.D.1.b shall also be met.
    3. Exceptions from required street improvements. As a Type 1 decision, the Director, in consultation with the Director of Transportation, may waive or modify the requirements for paving and drainage, dedication, setbacks, grading, no-protest agreements, landscaping, and curb installation if one or more of the following conditions are met. The waiver or modification shall provide the minimum relief necessary to accommodate site conditions while maximizing access and circulation.

        1. Location in an environmentally critical area or buffer, disruption of existing drainage patterns, or removal of natural features such as significant trees or other valuable and character-defining mature vegetation makes widening and/or improving the right-of-way impractical or undesirable.
        2. The existence of a bridge, viaduct or structure such as a substantial retaining wall in proximity to the project site makes widening and/or improving the right-of-way impractical or undesirable.
        3. Widening the right-of-way and/or improving the street would adversely affect the character of the street, as it is defined in an adopted neighborhood plan or adopted City plan for green streets, boulevards, or other special rights-of-way, or would otherwise conflict with the stated goals of such a plan.
        4. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would preclude vehicular access to an existing lot.
        5. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would make building on a lot infeasible by reducing it to dimensions where development standards cannot reasonably be met.
        6. One or more substantial principal structures on the same side of the block as the proposed project are located in the area needed for future expansion of the right-of-way and the structure(s)' condition and size make future widening of the remainder of the right-of-way unlikely.
        7. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is impractical because topography would preclude the use of the street for vehicular access to the lot, for example due to an inability to meet the required 20 percent maximum driveway slope.
        8. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is not necessary because it is adequate for current and potential vehicular traffic, for example, due to the limited number of lots served by the development or because the development on the street is at zoned capacity.

            1. All structures on the lot shall be designed and built to accommodate the grade of the future street improvements.
            2. A no-protest agreement to future street improvements is required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the title to the property with the King County Department of Records and Elections.
            3. If there is no sidewalk, a sidewalk shall be constructed, except when an exception set forth in Section 23.53.006 is applicable.
        2. Streets With Less Than the Minimum Right-of-way Width. When a street with existing curbs abuts a lot and the existing right-of-way is less than the minimum width established in subsection A6 of this section, the following requirements shall be met:

            1. Setback Requirement. A setback equal to half the difference between the current right-of-way width and the minimum right-of-way width established in subsection A6 of this section is required; provided, however, that if a setback has been provided under this provision, other lots on the block shall provide the same setback. The area of the setback may be used to meet any development standard, except that required parking may not be located in the setback. Underground structures that would not prevent the future widening and improvements of the right-of-way may be permitted in the required setback by the Director after consulting with the Director of Transportation.
            2. Grading Requirement. When a setback is required, all structures on the lot shall be designed and built to accommodate the grade of the future street, as specified in the Right-of-Way Improvements Manual.
            3. A no-protest agreement to future street improvements is required, as authorized by RCW Chapter 35.43. The agreement shall be recorded with the title to the property with the King County Department of Records and Elections.
            4. If there is no sidewalk, a sidewalk shall be constructed except when an exception set forth in Section 23.53.006 is applicable.
    2. Projects with Reduced Improvement Requirements. The following types of projects are exempt from all dedication and improvement requirements of subsections 23.53.020.B, 23.53.020.C and 23.53.020.D, but shall meet the pedestrian access and circulation requirements specified in Section 23.53.006 and the requirements of subsection 23.53.020.E.1.b if the street right-of-way abutting the lot has less than the minimum right-of-way width established in subsection 23.53.020.A or does not meet the grade of future street improvements.

        1. Structures with fewer than ten artist's studio dwellings;
        2. The following uses when they are smaller than 750 square feet of gross floor area: major and minor vehicle repair uses, and multipurpose retail sales uses;
        3. Nonresidential structures that have less than 4,000 square feet of gross floor area and that do not contain uses listed in subsection 23.53.020.E.2.b that are larger than 750 square feet;
        4. Structures containing a mix of artist's studio dwellings and nonresidential uses, if there are fewer than ten artist's studio dwellings, and the square footage of nonresidential use is less than specified in subsections 23.53.020.E.2.b and 23.53.020.E.2.c;
        5. Remodeling and use changes within existing structures;
        6. Additions to existing structures that are exempt from environmental review; and
        7. Expansions of surface parking, outdoor storage, outdoor sales or outdoor display of rental equipment of less than 20 percent of the parking, storage, sales or display area, or number of parking spaces.
    3. Exceptions from Street Improvement Requirements. The Director, in consultation with the Director of Transportation, may waive or modify the requirements for paving, dedication, setbacks, grading, no-protest agreements, landscaping, and curb installation when it is determined that one (1) or more of the following conditions are met. The waiver or modification shall provide the minimum relief necessary to accommodate site conditions while maximizing access and circulation.

        1. Location in an environmentally critical area or buffer, disruption of existing drainage patterns, or removal of natural features such as significant trees or other valuable and character-defining mature vegetation makes widening and/or improving the right-of-way impractical or undesirable.
        2. The existence of a bridge, viaduct or structure such as a substantial retaining wall in proximity to the project site makes widening and/or improving the right-of-way impractical or undesirable.
        3. Widening the right-of-way and/or improving the street would adversely affect the character of the street, as it is defined in an adopted neighborhood plan or adopted City plan for Green Streets, boulevards, or other special right-of-way, or would otherwise conflict with the stated goals of such a plan.
        4. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would make building on a lot infeasible by reducing it to dimensions where development standards cannot reasonably be met.
        5. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would preclude vehicular access to an existing lot.
        6. One (1) or more substantial principal structures on the same side of the block as the proposed project are located in the area needed for future expansion of the right-of-way and the structure(s)' condition and size make future widening of the remainder of the right-of-way unlikely.
        7. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is impractical because topography would preclude the use of the street for vehicular access to the lot, for example due to an inability to meet the required twenty (20) percent maximum driveway slope.
        8. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is not necessary because it is adequate for current and potential vehicular traffic, for example, due to the limited number of lots served by the development or because the development on the street is at zoned capacity.

#### 23.53.025 - Access easement standards

Underground and overhead portions of structures that would not interfere with the functioning of the alley may be allowed by the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections after consulting with the Director of Transportation. When existing structures are located in the portion of the lot to be dedicated, that portion of the lot shall be exempt from dedication requirements. The improvements required under subsection 23.53.030.E.1 shall then be installed, depending on the type of project.
    2. When an existing alley is not used for access to parking spaces or loading berths on an abutting lot, but the alley does not meet the minimum width established in subsection 23.53.030.D, except as provided in subsection 23.53.030.G, the following requirements shall be met:

        1. A setback equal to half the distance between the current alley right-of-way width and the minimum right-of-way width established in subsection 23.53.030.D shall be required; provided, however, that if a setback has been provided under this provision, other lots on the block shall provide the same setback. The area of the setback may be used to meet any development standards, except that required parking may not be located in the setback. Underground and overhead structures which would not prevent the future widening and improvement of the right-of-way may be permitted in the required setback by the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections after consulting with the Director of Transportation.
        2. All structures shall be designed to accommodate the grade of the future alley right-of-way.
        3. A no-protest agreement to future street improvements shall be required, as authorized by chapter 35.43 RCW. The agreement shall be recorded with the title to the property with the King County Recorder's Office.
7. Exceptions. The Director, after consulting with the Director of the Department of Transportation, may modify or waive the requirements for dedication, paving and drainage, setbacks, grading and no-protest agreements, if it is determined that one (1) or more of the following conditions are met. The Director may require access to be from a street if alley improvements are also waived.

    1. Location in an environmentally critical area or buffer, disruption of existing drainage patterns, or removal of natural features such as significant trees makes widening and/or improving the right-of-way impractical or undesirable;
    2. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would make a building on a lot infeasible by reducing it to dimensions where development standards cannot reasonably be met;
    3. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way would eliminate alley access to an existing lot;
    4. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is impractical because topography precludes the use of the alley for vehicular access to the lot;
    5. The alley is in a historic district or special review district, and the Department of Neighborhoods Director finds, after review and recommendation by the appropriate review board, that the widening and/or improvement would be detrimental to the character and goals of the district;
    6. The existence of a bridge, viaduct or structure such as a substantial retaining wall makes widening the right-of-way impractical or undesirable;
    7. Widening the right-of-way would adversely affect the character of the street, as it is defined in an adopted neighborhood plan or adopted City plan for green streets, boulevard, or other special right-of-way, or would otherwise conflict with the stated goals of such a plan;
    8. One (1) or more substantial principal structures on the same side of the block as the proposed project are located in the area needed for future expansion of the right-of-way and the structure(s)' condition and size make future widening of the remainder of the right-of-way unlikely;
    9. Widening and/or improving the right-of-way is not necessary because it is adequate for current and potential pedestrian and vehicular traffic, for example, due to the limited number of lots served by the development or because the development on the right-of-way is at zoned capacity.

#### 23.53.035 - Structural building overhangs and minor architectural encroachments

Structural building overhangs and minor architectural encroachments shall meet the following standards:

<td>Footnotes to Table B for 23.54.015The minimum amount of parking prescribed by line I of Table B for 23.54.015 does not apply if a use, structure or development qualifies for a greater or a lesser amount of parking, including no parking, under any other provision of this Section 23.54.015. If more than one such provision may apply, the provision requiring the least amount of parking applies, except that if an applicable parking requirement in line II of Table B for 23.54.015 requires more parking than line I, the parking requirement in line I does not apply. For development within single-family zones the Director may waive some or all of the parking requirements according to Section 23.44.015 as a special or reasonable accommodation. In other zones, if the applicant can demonstrate that less parking is needed to provide a special or reasonable accommodation, the Director may reduce the requirement. The Director shall specify the parking required and link the parking reduction to the features of the program that allow such reduction. The parking reductions are effective only as long as the conditions that justify the waiver are present. When the conditions are no longer present, the development shall provide the amount of parking that otherwise is required. Notice of income restrictions. If these provisions are applied to a development, then prior to the issuance of any permit to establish, construct or modify the development, or to reduce the amount of parking accessory to the development, the applicant shall record with the King County Recorder a restrictive covenant signed and acknowledged by the owner(s), in a form prescribed by the Director, that provides notice that compliance with the income limits prescribed by this Section 23.54.015 is a condition for maintaining the reduced parking allowed by this Section 23.54.015, and requiring any subsequent owner to provide the amount of parking otherwise required in the event the income limits are not met.</td>

Footnotes for Table C for 23.54.015:


1. When this use is permitted in a single-family zone as a conditional use, the Director may modify the parking requirements pursuant to Section 23.44.022; when the use is permitted in a multifamily zone as a conditional use, the Director may modify the parking requirements pursuant to Section 23.45.570. The Director, in consultation with the Director of Transportation, may allow adult care and child care centers locating in existing structures to provide loading and unloading spaces on-street when no other alternative exists.
2. The amount of required parking is calculated based on the maximum number of staff, children, or clients that the center is designed to accommodate on site at any one time.
3. A child care facility, when co-located with an assisted living facility, may count the passenger load/unload space required for the assisted living facility toward its required passenger load/unload spaces.
4. When family support centers are located within community centers owned and operated by the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Director may lower the combined parking requirement by up to a maximum of 15 percent, pursuant to subsection 23.54.020.I.
5. Indoor gymnasiums are not considered ball courts, nor are they considered auditoria or public assembly rooms unless they contain bleachers (fixed seats). If the gymnasium contains bleachers, the parking requirement for the gymnasium is one parking space for every eight fixed seats. Each 20 inches of width of bleachers is counted as one fixed seat for the purposes of determining parking requirements. If the gymnasium does not contain bleachers and is in a school, there is no parking requirement for the gymnasium. If the gymnasium does not contain bleachers and is in a community center, the parking requirement is one space for each 350 square feet.
6. When a library is permitted in a single-family zone as a conditional use, the Director may modify the parking requirements pursuant to Section 23.44.022; when a library is permitted in a multifamily zone as a conditional use, the Director may modify the parking requirements pursuant to Section 23.45.122; and when a library is permitted in a commercial zone, the Director may modify the parking requirements pursuant to subsection 23.44.022.L.
7. For public schools, when an auditorium or other place of assembly is demolished and a new one built in its place, parking requirements are determined based on the new construction. When an existing public school on an existing public school site is remodeled, additional parking is required if any auditorium or other place of assembly is expanded or additional fixed seats are added. Additional parking is required as shown on Table C for 23.54.015 for the increase in floor area or increase in number of seats only. If the parking requirement for the increased area or seating is 10 percent or less than that for the existing auditorium or other place of assembly, then no additional parking is required.
8. Development standard departures may be granted or required pursuant to the procedures and criteria set forth in Chapter 23.79 to reduce the required or permitted number of parking spaces.
9. The general requirement of lines A through O of Table C for 23.54.015 for general public uses, institutions, and requirements of subsection 23.54.016.B for Major Institution uses are superseded to the extent that a use, structure or development qualifies for either a greater or a lesser parking requirement (which may include no requirement) under any other provision. To the extent that a general public use, institution or Major Institution use fits within more than one line in Table C for 23.54.015, the least of the applicable parking requirements applies. The different parking requirements listed for certain categories of general public uses or institutions shall not be construed to create separate uses for purposes of any requirements related to establishing or changing a use under this Title 23.

1. Minimum parking requirements. The minimum number of off-street motor vehicle parking spaces required for specific uses is set forth in Table A for 23.54.015 for non-residential uses other than institutional uses, Table B for 23.54.015 for residential uses, and Table C for 23.54.015 for institutional uses, except as otherwise provided in this Section 23.54.015 and Section 23.54.020. The minimum parking requirements are based upon gross floor area of a use within a structure and the square footage of a use when located outside of an enclosed structure, or as otherwise specified. Exceptions to the parking requirements set forth in this Section 23.54.015 are provided in subsection 23.54.015.B and in Section 23.54.020, Parking quantity exceptions, unless otherwise specified. This Chapter 23.54 does not apply to parking for construction activity, which is regulated by Section 23.42.044.
2. Parking requirements for specific zones

    1. Parking in downtown zones is regulated by Section 23.49.019 and not by this Section 23.54.015.
    2. Parking in the MPC-YT zone is regulated by Section 23.75.180 and not by this Section 23.54.015.
    3. Parking for major institution uses in the Major Institution Overlay District is regulated by Sections 23.54.015 and 23.54.016.
    4. Parking in the Northgate Overlay District is regulated by Chapter 23.54 except as modified by Section 23.71.016.
    5. No parking is required for single-family residential uses on lots in any residential zone that are less than 3,000 square feet in size or 30 feet in width where access to parking is permitted through a required yard or setback abutting a street according to the standards of subsections 23.44.016.B.2, 23.45.536.C.2, or 23.45.536.C.3.
    6. No parking is required for urban farms or community gardens in residential zones
3. Maximum parking limits

    1. In the Stadium Transition Area Overlay District certain uses are subject to a maximum parking ratio pursuant to subsection 23.74.010.A.1.b. When there are multiple uses on a lot, the total parking requirement for all uses subject to a maximum ratio cannot exceed the aggregate maximum for those uses under Section 23.74.010.
    2. In all commercial zones, except C2 zones outside of urban villages, no more than 145 spaces per lot may be provided as surface parking.
    3. In all multifamily zones, commercial uses are limited to no more than ten parking spaces per business establishment.
4. Parking waivers for non-residential uses

    1. In all commercial zones and in pedestrian-designated zones, no parking is required for the first 1,500 square feet of each business establishment or the first 15 fixed seats for motion picture and performing arts theaters.
    2. In all other zones, no parking is required for the first 2,500 square feet of gross floor area of non-residential uses in a structure, except for the following:

        1. structures or portions of structures occupied by restaurants with drive-in lanes,
        2. motion picture theaters,
        3. offices, or
        4. institution uses, including Major Institution uses.
5. Fleet vehicles. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, off-street parking shall be provided for all fleet vehicles and those parking spaces will not be counted toward the parking requirements of Table A, Table B, or Table C.
6. Use and reuse of schools. For non-school uses permitted to locate in a former or existing public school, parking requirements will be determined by school use pursuant to criteria adopted according to Chapter 23.78, Establishment of Criteria for Joint Use or Reuse of Schools.
7. New non-residential uses in existing structures in commercial and industrial zones. Up to 20 required parking spaces are waived for a new non-residential use established in an existing structure or the expansion of an existing non-residential use entirely within an existing structure. Existing required parking shall remain. For purposes of this Section 23.54.015, "existing structure" means a structure that was established under permit, or for which a building permit has been granted and has not expired, at least two years prior to the application to establish the new use or expand the use. Parking spaces required for loading and unloading of passengers are not eligible for the waiver under this subsection 23.54.015.G.
8. Uses not shown on parking tables. In the case of a use not shown on Table A, Table B, or Table C, the requirements for off-street parking will be determined by the Director based on the requirements for the most comparable use. Where, in the judgment of the Director, none of the uses on Table A, Table B, and Table C are comparable to a proposed use, the Director may base his or her determination as to the amount of parking required for the proposed use on detailed information provided by the applicant. The information required may include, but not be limited to, a description of the physical structure(s), identification of potential users, and analysis of likely parking demand.
9. Uses in multiple parking table categories. If an entire use or structure, or the same portion of a use or structure, falls under more than one category in Table A, Table B or Table C then, unless otherwise specified, the category requiring the smallest number of parking spaces applies except as expressly set forth on such tables.
10. Existing parking deficits. Existing legal parking deficits of legally established uses are allowed to continue even if a change of use occurs. This subsection will not be construed to permit a parking deficit caused by the failure to satisfy conditions of a reduced parking requirement for any use or structure.
11. Bicycle parking. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces for bicycles required for specified uses is set forth in Table D for 23.54.015. In the case of a use not shown on Table D for 23.54.015, there is no minimum bicycle parking requirement. The minimum requirements are based upon gross floor area of the use in a structure, or the square footage of the use when located outside of an enclosed structure, or as otherwise specified.

    1. After the first 50 spaces for bicycles are provided, additional spaces are required at ½ the ratio shown in Table D for 23.54.015, except for rail transit facilities; passenger terminals; and park and ride lots. Spaces within dwelling units or on balconies do not count toward the bicycle parking requirement.
    2. Required bicycle parking shall be provided in a safe, accessible and convenient location. Bicycle parking hardware shall be installed so that it can perform to its manufacturer's specifications and any design criteria promulgated by the Director of Transportation, allowing adequate clearance for bicycles and their riders. Directional signage shall be installed when bike parking facilities are not clearly visible from the street or sidewalk. If any covered automobile parking is provided, all required long-term bicycle parking shall be covered. If located off-street, bicycle and automobile parking areas shall be separated by a barrier or painted lines.
    3. Long-term parking for bicycles shall be for bicycles parked four hours or more. Short-term parking for bicycles shall be for bicycles parked less than four hours.
    4. Bicycle parking required for residential uses shall be located on-site.
    5. Bicycle parking required for small efficiency dwelling units and congregate residence sleeping rooms is required to be covered for weather protection. If the required, covered bicycle parking is located inside the building that contains small efficiency dwelling units or congregate residence sleeping rooms, the space required to provide the required bicycle parking shall be exempt from Floor Area Ratio (FAR) limits. Covered bicycle parking that is provided beyond the required bicycle parking shall not be exempt from FAR limits.
    6. Bicycle parking facilities shared by more than one use are encouraged.
    7. Bicycle parking facilities required for nonresidential uses shall be located on the lot or in a shared bicycle parking facility within 100 feet of the lot, except as provided in subsection 23.54.015.K.8.
    8. Bicycle parking may be located in a facility within 100 feet of the lot that is not a shared bicycle parking facility, or public bicycle parking may be provided in the right-of-way, subject to approval by the Director of Transportation, in lieu of providing required on-site bicycle parking, if the Director determines that:

        1. Safe, accessible, and convenient bicycle parking accessory to a non-residential use cannot be provided on-site or in a shared bicycle parking facility within 100 feet of the lot, without extraordinary physical or financial difficulty;
        2. The bicycle parking in the right-of-way is equivalent to bicycle parking that would otherwise be required on-site, and takes into consideration the cost of materials, equipment and labor for installation;
        3. The bicycle parking in the right-of-way is located within sufficient proximity to serve the bicycle parking demand generated by the project; and
        4. Construction of the bicycle parking is completed before issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the development.

#### 23.54.016 - Major Institutions—parking and transportation

Except in the MPC-YT zone, Major Institution uses are subject to the following transportation and parking requirements:


1. General Provisions.

    1. Minimum requirements for parking quantity are established in subsection 23.54.016.B.
    2. The maximum number of spaces provided for the Major Institution use shall not exceed 135 percent of the minimum requirement, unless additional spaces are approved through administrative or Council review as provided in subsection 23.54.016.C. For a Major Institution use in an urban center or the Station Area Overlay District, the maximum limit shall not exceed 135 percent of the minimum parking requirements calculated pursuant to subsection 23.54.016.B.2.
    3. Parking requirements for Major Institutions with more than one type of institutional use (for example, a hospital and a university), if applicable, shall be calculated for each use separately, and then added together to derive the total number of required spaces.
    4. When a permit application is made for new development at an existing Major Institution and the new development is a hospital or located outside an urban center or the Station Area Overlay District, parking requirements shall be calculated both for the entire Major Institution and for the proposed new development. If there is a parking deficit for the entire institution, the institution shall make up a portion of the deficit in addition to the quantity required for the new development, according to subsection 23.54.016.B.3. If there is a parking surplus above the maximum allowed number of spaces for the institution as a whole, required amounts of parking for new development will first be applied to the surplus in the required ratio of long-term and short-term spaces. Additional parking shall be permitted only when no surplus remains.
    5. When determining parking requirements, individuals fitting into more than one category (for example, a student who is also an employee or a faculty member who is also a doctor) shall not be counted twice. The category requiring the greater number of parking spaces shall be used.
2. Parking Quantity Required.

    1. In urban centers and the Station Area Overlay District, no parking is required for Major Institution uses, except for hospitals.
    2. For all other Major Institutions the minimum number of parking spaces required is as follows:

        1. Long-term Parking.

            1. Medical Institutions. A number of spaces equal to 80 percent of hospital-based doctors; plus 25 percent of staff doctors; plus 30 percent of all other employees present at peak hour;
            2. Educational Institutions. A number of spaces equal to 15 percent of the maximum students present at peak hour, excluding resident students; plus 30 percent of employees present at peak hour; plus 25 percent of the resident unmarried students; plus one space for each married student apartment unit.
        2. Short-term Parking.

            1. Medical Institutions. A number of spaces equal to one space per six beds; plus one space per five average daily outpatients;
            2. Educational Institutions. A number of spaces equal to five percent of the maximum students present at peak hour excluding resident students.
        3. Additional Short-term Parking Requirements. When one of the following uses is a Major Institution use, the following additional short-term parking requirements shall be met. Such requirements may be met by joint use of parking areas and facilities if the Director determines that the uses have different hours of operation according to subsection 23.54.020.G:

            1. Museum. One space for each 250 square feet of public floor area;
            2. Theater, Auditorium, or Assembly Hall. One space for each 200 square feet of audience assembly area not containing fixed seats, and one space for every 10 seats for floor area containing fixed seats;
            3. Spectator Sports Facility Containing Fewer than 20,000 Seats. One space for each 10 permanent seats and one space for each 100 square feet of spectator assembly area not containing fixed seats;
            4. Spectator Sports Facility Containing 20,000 or More Seats. One space for each 10 permanent seats and one bus space for each 300 permanent seats.
        4. Bicycle Parking. Bicycle parking meeting the development standards of subsections 23.54.015.K.2 through 23.54.015.K.6 and subsection 23.54.016.D.2 shall be provided in the following quantities:

            1. Medical Institutions. A number of spaces equal to two percent of employees, including doctors, present at peak hour;
            2. Educational Institutions. A number of spaces equal to 10 percent of the maximum students present at peak hour plus five percent of employees.
If at the time of application for a master use permit, the applicant can demonstrate that the bicycle parking requirement is inappropriate for a particular institution because of topography, location, nature of the users of the institution or other reasons, the Director may modify the bicycle parking requirement.


1. Parking Deficits. In addition to providing the minimum required parking for a new structure, five percent of any vehicular or bicycle parking deficit as determined by the minimum requirements of this subsection 23.54.016.B, existing on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, shall be supplied before issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
2. Requirement for a Transportation Management Program.

    1. When a Major Institution proposes parking in excess of 135 percent of the applicable minimum requirement for short-term parking spaces calculated pursuant to subsections 23.54.016.A and 23.54.016.B, or when a Major Institution prepares a master plan or applies for a master use permit for development that would provide 20 or more parking spaces or increase the Major Institution's number of parking spaces by 20 or more above the level existing on May 2, 1990, a transportation management program shall be required or an existing transportation management program shall be reviewed and updated. The Director shall assess the traffic and parking impacts of the proposed development against the general goal of reducing the percentage of the Major Institution's employees, staff and/or students who commute in single-occupancy vehicles (SOV) during the peak period to 50 percent or less, excluding those employees or staff whose work regularly requires the use of a private vehicle during working hours.
    2. Transportation management programs are prepared and implemented in accordance with the Director's Rule governing Transportation Management Programs. The Transportation Management Program shall be in effect upon Council adoption of the Major Institution master plan.
    3. If an institution has previously prepared a transportation management program, the Director, in consultation with the Director of Transportation shall review the Major Institution's progress toward meeting stated goals. The Director shall then determine:

        1. That the existing program should be revised to correct deficiencies and/or address new or cumulative impacts; or
        2. That the application will not be approved until the Major Institution makes substantial progress toward meeting the goals of its existing program; or
        3. That a new program should be developed to address impacts associated with the application; or
        4. That the existing program does not need to be revised.
    4. Through the process of reviewing a new or updated transportation management program in conjunction with reviewing a master plan, the Council may approve in excess of 135 percent of the minimum requirements for long-term parking spaces, or may increase or decrease the required 50 percent SOV goal, based upon the Major Institution's impacts on traffic and opportunities for alternative means of transportation. Factors to be considered shall include, but not be limited to:

        1. Proximity to a street with 15 minute transit service headway in each direction;
        2. Air quality conditions in the vicinity of the Major Institution;
        3. The absence of other nearby traffic generators and the level of existing and future traffic volumes in and through the surrounding area;
        4. The patterns and peaks of traffic generated by Major Institution uses and the availability or lack of on-street parking opportunities in the surrounding area;
        5. The impact of additional parking on the Major Institution site;
        6. The extent to which the scheduling of classes or work shifts reduces the transportation alternatives available to employees and/or students or the presence of limited carpool opportunities due to the small number of employees; and
        7. The extent to which the Major Institution has demonstrated a commitment to SOV alternatives.
    5. The provision of short-term parking spaces in excess of 135 percent of the minimum requirements established in subsection 23.54.016.B.2 may be permitted by the Director through preparation or update of a Transportation Management Program. In evaluating whether to allow more than 135 percent of the minimum, the Director, in consultation with the Director of Transportation, shall consider evidence of parking demand and opportunities for alternative means of transportation. Factors to be considered shall include but are not necessarily limited to the criteria contained in subsection 23.54.015.D.1.b and the following:

        1. The nature of services provided by Major Institution uses which generate short-term parking demand; and
        2. The extent to which the Major Institution manages short-term parking to ensure its availability to meet short-term parking needs.
Based on this review, the Director shall determine the amount of additional short-term parking to be permitted, if any.


1. When an institution applies for a permit for development included in its master plan, it shall present evidence that it has made substantial progress toward the goals of its transportation management program as approved with a master plan, including the SOV goal. If substantial progress is not being made, as determined by the Director in consultation with the Seattle Department of Transportation and metropolitan King County, the Director may:

    1. Require the institution to take additional steps to comply with the transportation management program; and/or
    2. Require measures in addition to those in the transportation management program which encourage alternative means of transportation for the travel generated by the proposed new development; and/or
    3. Deny the permit if previous efforts have not resulted in sufficient progress toward meeting the SOV goals of the institution.
2. Development Standards for Parking.

    1. Long-term Parking.

        1. Carpools and vanpools shall be given guaranteed spaces in a more convenient location to the Major Institution uses they serve than SOV spaces, and shall be charged substantially less than the prevailing parking rates for SOVs.
        2. There shall be a charge for all noncarpool/vanpool long-term parking spaces.
    2. Bicycle Parking.

        1. Required bicycle parking shall be in a convenient location, covered in the same proportion as auto parking spaces and provided free of charge.
        2. Bicycle rack designs shall accommodate locking of the bicycle frame and both wheels with chains, cables, or U-shaped bicycle locks to an immovable rack or stall.
    3. Joint use or shared use of parking areas and facilities shall be encouraged if approved by the Director according to the standards of Section 23.54.020 G.
    4. The location and design of off-street parking and access to off-street parking shall be regulated according to the general standards of Chapter 23.54 and the specific standards of the underlying zone in which the parking is located.

#### 23.54.020 - Parking quantity exceptions

The parking quantity exceptions set forth in this section apply in all zones except downtown zones, which are regulated by Section 23.49.019, and Major Institution zones, which are regulated by Section 23.54.016.


1. Adding Units to Existing Structures in Multifamily and Commercial Zones.

    1. For the purposes of this Section 23.54.020, "existing structures" means those structures that were established under permit, or for which a permit has been granted and has not expired as of the applicable date, as follows:

        1. In multifamily zones, August 10, 1982;
        2. In commercial zones, June 9, 1986.
    2. In locations in a multifamily or commercial zone where there is a minimum parking requirement, one dwelling unit may either be added to an existing structure or may be built on a lot that contains an existing structure without additional parking if both of the following requirements are met:

        1. Either the existing parking provided on the lot meets development standards, or the lot area is not increased and existing parking is screened and landscaped to the greatest extent practical; and
        2. Any additional parking shall meet all development standards for the zone.
    3. In locations in a multifamily or commercial zone where there is a minimum parking requirement, the Director may authorize a reduction or waiver of the parking requirement as a Type I decision when dwelling units are proposed to be added either to an existing structure or on a lot that contains an existing structure, in addition to the exception permitted in subsection 23.54.020.A.2, if the conditions in subsections 23.54.020.A.3.a and b below are met, and either of the conditions in subsections 23.54.020.A.3.c or d below are met:

        1. The only use of the structure will be residential; and
        2. The lot is not located in either the University District Parking Overlay Area (Map A for 23.54.015) or the Alki Area Parking Overlay (Map B for 23.54.015); and
        3. The topography of the lot or location of existing structures makes provision of an off-street parking space physically infeasible in a conforming location; or
        4. The lot is located in a residential parking zone (RPZ) and a current parking study is submitted showing a utilization rate of less than 75 percent for on-street parking within 400 feet of all lot lines.
2. Tandem Parking in Multifamily Structures.

    1. Off-street parking required for multifamily structures may be provided as tandem parking, as defined in Section 23.54.030. A tandem parking space counts as one and one-half (1 ½) parking spaces, except as provided in subsection B2 below, and must meet the minimum size requirements of subsection A of Section 23.54.030.
    2. When a minimum of at least one (1) parking space per dwelling unit in a multifamily structure is required, the total number of parking spaces provided, counting each tandem parking space as one space, may not be less than the total number of dwelling units.
3. Parking Exception for Landmark Structures. The Director may reduce or waive the minimum accessory off-street parking requirements for a use permitted in a Landmark structure, or when a Landmark structure is completely converted to residential use according to Sections 23.42.108 or 23.45.506, or for a use in a Landmark district that is located in a commercial zone, as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions.

    1. In making any such reduction or waiver, the Director will assess area parking needs. The Director may require a survey of on- and off-street parking availability. The Director may take into account the level of transit service in the immediate area; the probable relative importance of walk-in traffic; proposals by the applicant to encourage carpooling or transit use by employees; hours of operation; and any other factor or factors considered relevant in determining parking impact.
    2. The Director may also consider the types and scale of uses proposed or practical in the Landmark structure, and the controls imposed by the Landmark designation.
    3. Such a reduction or waiver may be allowed, for conversion of structures to residential use, only if the Director also determine that there is no feasible way to meet parking requirements on the lot.
4. Expansion of Existing Nonresidential Uses in Commercial Zones. In commercial zones additional parking spaces for nonresidential uses are not required for the expansion of existing structures if the minimum parking requirement would not be increased by more than ten (10) percent. If the minimum parking requirement would be increased by more than ten (10) percent, the parking spaces required for the entire expansion shall be provided. This exception may be used only once for any individual structure.
5. RESERVED
6. Reductions to minimum parking requirements.

    1. When parking is required, reductions to minimum parking requirements permitted by this subsection 23.54.020.F will be calculated from the minimum parking requirements in Section 23.54.015. Total reductions to required parking as provided in this subsection 23.54.020.F may not exceed 50 percent.
    2. Transit reduction.

        1. In multifamily and commercial zones, the minimum parking requirement for all uses is reduced by 50 percent if the use is located within 1,320 feet of a street with frequent transit service. This distance will be the walking distance measured from the nearest transit stop to the lot line of the lot containing the use.
        2. In industrial zones, the minimum parking requirement for a nonresidential use is reduced by 15 percent if the use is located within 1,320 feet of a street with peak transit service headways of 15 minutes or less. This distance will be the walking distance measured from the nearest transit stop to the lot line of the lot containing the use.
    3. For new or expanding offices or manufacturing uses that require 40 or more parking spaces, the minimum parking requirement may be reduced by up to a maximum of 40 percent by the substitution of alternative transportation programs, according to the following provisions:

        1. For every carpool space accompanied by a cash fee, performance bond or alternative guarantee acceptable to the Director, the total parking requirement will be reduced by 1.9 spaces, up to a maximum of 40 percent of the parking requirement.
        2. For every vanpool purchased or leased by the applicant for employee use, or equivalent cash fee for purchase of a van by the public ridesharing agency, the total parking requirement will be reduced by six spaces, up to a maximum of 20 percent of the parking requirement.
        3. If transit or transportation passes are provided with a 50 percent or greater cost reduction to all employees in a proposed structure for the duration of the business establishment(s) within it, or five years, whichever is less, and if transit service is located within 800 feet, the parking requirement shall be reduced by 10 percent. With a 25 percent to 49 percent cost reduction, and if transit service is located within 800 feet, the parking requirement shall be reduced by 5 percent.
        4. For every four covered bicycle parking spaces provided, the total parking requirement shall be reduced by one space, up to a maximum of 5 percent of the parking requirement, provided that there is access to an arterial over improved streets.
7. Shared Parking.

    1. Shared Parking, General Provisions.

        1. Shared parking is allowed between two (2) or more uses to satisfy all or a portion of the minimum off-street parking requirement of those uses as provided in subsections G2 and G3.
        2. Shared parking is allowed between different categories of uses or between uses with different hours of operation, but not both.
        3. A use for which an application is being made for shared parking must be located within eight hundred (800) feet of the parking.
        4. No reduction to the parking requirement may be made if the proposed uses have already received a reduction through the provisions for cooperative parking, subsection H.
        5. Reductions to parking permitted through shared use of parking will be determined as a percentage of the minimum parking requirement as modified by the reductions permitted in subsections A though F.
        6. An agreement providing for the shared use of parking, executed by the parties involved, must be filed with the Director. Shared parking privileges will continue in effect only as long as the agreement, binding on all parties, remains in force. If the agreement is no longer in force, then parking must be provided as otherwise required by this chapter.
    2. Shared Parking for Different Categories of Uses.

        1. A business establishment may share parking according to only one of the subsections G2b, G2c or G2d.
        2. If an office use shares parking with one of the following uses:

            5. automotive sales and services, or
            6. maritime sales and services; the parking requirement for the residential use may be reduced by thirty (30) percent, provided that the reduction does not exceed the minimum parking requirement for the nonresidential use.
        4. If an office and a residential use share off-street parking, the parking requirement for the residential use may be reduced by fifty (50) percent, provided that the reduction does not exceed the minimum parking requirement for the office use.
    3. Shared Parking for Uses With Different Hours of Operation.

        1. For the purposes of this section, the following uses will be considered daytime uses:

            1. Commercial uses, except eating and drinking establishments, lodging uses, and entertainment uses;
            2. Storage uses;
            3. Manufacturing uses; and
            4. Other similar primarily daytime uses, when authorized by the Director.

        3. Up to ninety (90) percent of the parking required for a daytime use may be supplied by the off-street parking provided by a nighttime or Sunday use and vice-versa, when authorized by the Director, except that this may be increased to one hundred (100) percent when the nighttime or Sunday use is a religious facility.
        4. The applicant must show that there is no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the uses for which the sharing of parking is proposed.
        5. The establishment of park-and-pool lots is permitted, provided that the park-and-pool lot will not use spaces required by another use if there is a substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the park-and-pool lot and the use.
8. Cooperative Parking.

    1. Cooperative parking is permitted between two (2) or more business establishments that are commercial uses according to the provisions of this subsection.
    2. Up to a twenty (20) percent reduction in the total number of required parking spaces for four (4) or more separate business establishments, fifteen (15) percent reduction for three (3) business establishments, and ten (10) percent reduction for two (2) commercial uses may be authorized by the Director under the following conditions:

        1. No reductions to the parking requirement may be made if the proposed business establishments have already received a reduction through the provisions for shared parking, subsection G of this section.
        2. Each business establishment for which the application is being made for cooperative parking is located within eight hundred (800) feet of the parking, and the parking is located in a commercial or residential-commercial zone or the Seattle Mixed (SM) zone.
        3. The reductions to parking permitted through cooperative parking will be determined as a percentage of the minimum parking requirement as modified by the reductions permitted in subsections A through F of this section.
        4. An agreement providing for the cooperative use of parking must be filed with the Director when the facility or area is established as cooperative parking. Cooperative parking privileges will continue in effect only as long as the agreement to use the cooperative parking remains in force. If the agreement is no longer in force, then parking must be provided as otherwise required by this chapter. New business establishments seeking to meet parking requirements by becoming part of an existing cooperative arrangement must provide the Director with an amendment to the agreement stating their inclusion in the cooperative parking facility or area.
9. Reductions to Minimum Parking Requirements for Department of Parks and Recreation (DOPAR) Community Centers.

    1. When family support centers are located within DOPAR community centers, the Director may, upon request by DOPAR, lower the combined parking requirement for the community center and the family support center up to a maximum of fifteen (15) percent.
    2. The parking requirement may be reduced only if the reduction is supported by a recommendation of the Project Advisory Committee formed to review the DOPAR community center, and the Director determines and makes written findings that:

        1. The lower parking requirement is necessary to preserve existing natural features or recreational facilities deemed significant by DOPAR and the Project Advisory Committee formed to review the DOPAR community center, and the reduction is the minimum necessary to preserve such features and/or facilities; and
        2. The surrounding streets can accommodate overflow parking from the combined community center and family support center or, alternatively, any adverse parking impacts on the neighborhood from the combined community center and family support center will be mitigated.
10. Parking for City-recognized Car-sharing Programs.

    1. For any development, one (1) space or up to five (5) percent of the total number of required spaces, whichever is greater, may be used to provide parking for vehicles operated by a car-sharing program. The number of required parking spaces will be reduced by one (1) space for every parking space leased by a car-sharing program.
    2. For any development requiring twenty (20) or more parking spaces under Section 23.54.015 that provides a space for vehicles operated by a car-sharing program, the number of required parking spaces may be reduced by the lesser of three (3) required parking spaces for each car-sharing space or fifteen (15) percent of the total number of required spaces. In order to gain this exception, an agreement between the property owner and a car-sharing program must be approved by the Director and the agreement, along with a notice that the agreement is the basis for this exception to the parking requirement, must be recorded with the title to the property before a Master Use Permit is issued.
11. Peat Settlement-prone Environmentally Critical Areas. Except in Single-family, Residential Small Lot, and Lowrise zones, the Director may reduce or waive the minimum accessory off-street parking requirements to the minimum extent necessary to offset underground parking potential lost to limitations set forth in Section 25.09.110 on development below the annual high static groundwater level in peat settlement-prone areas. In making any such reduction or waiver, the Director will assess area parking needs. The Director may require a survey of on- and off-street parking availability. The Director may take into account the level of transit service in the immediate area; the probable relative importance of walk-in traffic; proposals by the applicant to encourage carpooling or transit use by employees; hours of operation; and any other factor or factors considered relevant in determining parking impact.
12. SM/D/40-85 zone. As a Type I decision pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, the Director may reduce required parking for any proposed uses in the SM/D/40-85 zone to a level not less than the amount needed to serve parking demand to be generated by those uses as demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director by a parking demand study performed by a licensed professional engineer and submitted by the applicant.

#### 23.54.025 - Off-site parking

1. Where allowed

    1. Off-site parking provided to fulfill minimum parking requirements may be established by permit on a lot if the parking proposed is otherwise allowed by the provisions of this Title 23 on the lot where the off-site parking is proposed or is already established by permit on the lot where the off-site parking is proposed.
    2. All applicable standards for parking accessory to the use for which the parking is required shall be met on the lot where off-site parking is proposed, if new parking spaces are proposed to be developed. Existing parking may be used even if nonconforming to current standards provided it is not required for a use on the lot that is the site of the off-site parking.
    3. If parking and parking access, including the proposed off-site parking, are or will be the sole uses of a site, or if surface parking outside of structures will comprise more than ½ of the site area, or if parking will occupy more than half of the gross floor area of all structures on a site, then a permit to establish off-site parking may be granted only if principal use parking is a permitted use for the lot on which the off-site parking is located.
2. Development standards

    1. Off-site parking shall satisfy the screening and landscaping requirements and other development standards applicable where it is located, except to the extent that it is legally nonconforming to development standards prior to establishment of the off-site parking use. Unless otherwise provided, development standards regarding the relation of parking to structures apply to off-site parking in the same manner as they apply to parking accessory to the uses in such structures.
    2. Parking allowed only as temporary surface parking does not qualify as off-site parking.
    3. Parking provided to fulfill minimum parking requirements shall not be established as off-site parking for more than one use unless authorized to be shared according to the shared parking provisions of this Chapter 23.54.
    4. If maximum parking limits apply to a use, off-site parking permitted for that use shall count against the maximum limit unless otherwise expressly stated in the provisions of this Title 23 applicable to the lot where the use requiring parking is located.
3. Permit requirements.

    1. When all or part of the required parking for a use is to be provided on a lot other than the lot on which the use requiring parking is located, a permit must be obtained to establish off-site parking for the use requiring parking as a use on the off-site parking lot.
    2. The permit application must be submitted by or on behalf of the owner of the off-site parking lot along with written consent of the owner of the lot on which the use requiring parking is located, or such owner's authorized representative.
    3. The permit may be issued only after the applicant has demonstrated that the off-site parking complies with all applicable requirements of this Title 23. An application to establish off-site parking, or to change the use for which off-site parking is provided, may be considered as part of the application to establish, expand or change the use requiring off-site parking.
4. Required notice.

    1. When off-site parking is required parking for a use on any lot, notice of this off-site parking arrangement shall be recorded with the King County Recorder for both lots. The notice shall:

        1. include legal descriptions of both the lots on which the use requiring parking is located and the off-site parking lot; and
        2. identify by an attached drawing the number and location of spaces established as off-site parking for the use requiring parking;
    2. A copy of the notice, with attached drawing, shall be submitted as part of any permit application for any use for which the off-site parking is to be used to satisfy all or part of the parking requirement. Once the permit application is complete in every other respect, a copy of the notice, with attached drawing and a recording number assigned by the King County Recorder, shall be submitted prior to issuance of the permit.
5. Termination, change, or suspension of off-site parking use.

    1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection F of this Section 23.54.025, in order to terminate any off-site parking use, or to establish a new use for which off-site parking will be provided on the off-site parking lot, a change of use permit is required. Such a change of use permit shall not be issued unless:

        1. the owner of the lot on which the use requiring parking is located has been notified in writing of the change of use; and
        2. the off-site parking is not required for any reason, which may include one or more of the following:

            1. the use requiring parking has been discontinued or reduced in size;
            2. the parking is no longer required by this Title 23;
            3. other parking meeting the requirements of Title 23 has been provided for the use requiring parking and, if it is off-site parking, established by permit;
            4. a variance allowing the use requiring parking to continue without all or part of such off-site parking has been granted.
    2. If the owner of a lot where off-site parking is established plans to improve the lot and continue to provide off-site parking for the use requiring parking after completion of the improvements, the owners of such lot and the lot on which the use requiring parking is located, or such owners' authorized representatives, may apply for a temporary suspension of the off-site parking use, by submitting to the Director:

        1. a plan, with attached drawings showing the number and location of parking spaces, for providing interim parking for the use requiring parking, satisfying all applicable requirements of this title, until improvements to the off-site parking lot are completed;
        2. a plan, with attached drawings showing the number and location of parking spaces, for the provision of permanent parking for the use requiring parking, satisfying all applicable requirements of this title, when the improvements are completed; and
        3. such other materials as the Director may require to evaluate the proposal.
    3. If the Director approves the plans for purposes of subsection 23.54.025.E.2, then the Director may authorize the suspension of the off-site parking use pending the completion of the proposed improvements, conditioned upon issuance of a building permit for the proposed improvements, issuance of any permits necessary to establish the interim parking use, and the actual provision of the other off-site parking in accordance with applicable development standards.
    4. If a use requiring off-site parking is suspended as a result of fire, act of nature, or other causes beyond the control of the owners, or for substantial renovation or reconstruction, then subject to the applicable provisions in the zone or district where the off-site parking is located, the Director may approve the temporary use of the off-site parking to serve one or more other uses, or as general purpose parking, for a period not to exceed 180 days, subject to extensions for not more than 180 days if at the end of the initial period or any extension the use requiring parking has not recommenced.
    5. No permit for the demolition of a structure including off-site parking, established under this Section 24.54.025 or of any portion thereof necessary for such off-site parking, shall be issued, except in case of emergency, unless the off-site parking use has been terminated or temporarily suspended pursuant to this Section 23.54.025.E. If any such structure, or such portion thereof, is destroyed as a result of fire, act of nature, or other causes beyond the control of the owners, then the owner of the off-site parking lot may obtain a change of use permit. Upon such destruction of off-site parking, the lot on which the use requiring parking will be subject to Section 23.54.025.G.
6. Off-site parking established by covenant

    1. Off-site parking established by a covenant or other document approved by the Director and recorded in the King County real property records consistent with this Section 23.54.025 as in effect immediately prior to April 19, 2011, if that date is after either the date of vesting under Section 23.76.026 of the Master Use Permit application with which the covenant was submitted or the date when such covenant or other document was approved, may be used as required parking for the use(s) identified in such covenant to the extent consistent with the Master Use Permit and any other conditions of the Director's approval, without compliance with subsections 23.54.025.C and 23.54.025.D, so long as such off-site parking use is not discontinued for a period of 90 days, and subject to compliance with any applicable development standards. The owner of any such off-site parking spaces and the owner of the use requiring parking are each responsible for notifying the Director should the use of any or all of those spaces as off-site parking for the use requiring parking cease.
    2. When maximum parking limits apply to a use requiring off-site parking, off-site parking permitted for that use under this subsection 23.54.025.F shall count against the maximum limit unless otherwise expressly stated in the provisions of this Title 23 that apply to the lot where the use requiring parking is located.
    3. Off-site parking established by covenant or other document approved by the Director, and not by permit establishing off-site parking use, is not subject to the requirements of subsection 23.54.025.E.
    4. Any replacement off-site parking established by covenant in compliance with subsection 23.54.025.G.1.e shall be considered to have been established as described in subsection 23.54.025.F.1.
7. Effect of loss of required off-site parking.

    1. If, for any reason, any off-site parking used to satisfy the minimum required parking for any use requiring parking is not available for off-site parking for such use in conformity with the applicable use permit, then it shall be unlawful to continue the use requiring parking unless:

        1. other parking meeting the requirements of this Title 23 is provided on the same lot as the use requiring parking within 30 days;
        2. other off-site parking is secured, a permit is applied for to establish the off-site parking use within 30 days, such permit is obtained within 180 days, and the other off-site parking is completed in accordance with all applicable requirements and is in use within 180 days unless the Director, upon finding that substantial progress toward completion has been made and that the public will not be adversely affected by the extension, grants an extension in writing;
        3. the loss of off-site parking is caused by damage to or destruction of a structure, and either

#### 23.54.035 - Loading berth requirements and space standards

![23-54-035-1.png](./images/23-54-035-1.png)

![23-54-035-2.png](./images/23-54-035-2.png)


1. Quantity of Loading Spaces.

    1. The minimum number of off-street loading berths required for specific uses shall be set forth in Table A. (See Table A for Section 23.54.035.)
    2. For uses not listed on Table A the Director shall determine the loading berth requirements. Loading demand and loading requirements for similar uses shall be considered in determining such requirements.
    3. Existing deficits in the number of required loading berths shall be allowed to continue if a change of use occurs.
    4. Uses shall be considered low-demand uses, medium-demand uses and high-demand uses, as follows. (See Table for 23.54.035 A.)
    5. When a lot contains more than one (1) business establishment within the same category of low-, medium- or high-demand use, the square footage of the business establishments within the same category shall be added together in order to determine the number of required loading berths.
2. Exception to loading requirements

    1. For uses with less than 16,000 square feet of gross floor area that provide a loading space on a street or alley, the loading berth requirements may be waived by the Director if, after review, the Director of Transportation finds that the street or alley berth is adequate.
    2. Within the Downtown and South Lake Union Urban Centers and within the MPC-YT zone, loading berth requirements may be waived or modified if the Director finds, after consultation with and approval by the Director of Transportation, that the number of loading berths in Table A for 23.54.035 is not required and that the modified number will be sufficient. The applicant shall submit specific information addressing the following criteria, upon which the Director's determination shall be based:

        1. All loading is proposed to occur on-site; or
        2. Loading that is proposed to occur in a public right-of-way can take place without disrupting pedestrian circulation or vehicular traffic;
        3. Additional evidence relating to the size, character and operation of the building and likely tenancy; and
        4. Where loading occurs at a central loading facility, goods can be distributed to other buildings on-site without disrupting pedestrian circulation or vehicular traffic.
3. Standards for Loading Berths.

    1. Width and Clearance. Each loading berth shall be not less than ten (10) feet in width and shall provide not less than fourteen (14) feet vertical clearance.
    2. Length.

        1. High-demand Uses. Each loading berth for a high-demand use shall be a minimum of fifty-five (55) feet in length unless reduced by determination of the Director as provided at subsection C2c.
        2. Low- and Medium-demand Uses. Each loading berth for low- and medium-demand uses, except those uses identified in subsection C2d, shall be a minimum of thirty-five (35) feet in length unless reduced by determination of the Director as provided at subsection C2c.
        3. Exceptions to Loading Berth Length. Where the Director finds, after consulting with the property user, that site design and use of the property will not result in vehicles extending beyond the property line, loading berth lengths may be reduced to not less than the following:

            1. High-demand Uses. Thirty-five (35) feet when access is from a collector arterial or local access street; and forty-five (45) feet when access is from a principal or minor arterial street;
            2. Low- and Medium-demand Uses. Twenty-five (25) feet.
        4. Multipurpose convenience stores, sales, service and rental of major durables, and specialty food stores may be required by the Director to increase the length of required loading berths; however, these uses shall not be required to provide loading berths in excess of fifty-five (55) feet. The review of loading berth length requirements for these uses shall focus on the size of vehicles that frequently serve the business and the frequency of loading activity that will extend beyond the lot line during daytime hours (six (6:00) a.m. to six (6:00) p.m.). Large-truck loading occurring on a daily basis shall generally require longer loading berths; when such activity occurs on at least a weekly basis, it will be evaluated regarding the amount of traffic disruption and safety problems potentially created; such activity occurring on less than a weekly basis shall generally not require longer loading berths.
    3. For uses not listed in Table A, the Director shall determine the loading berth length requirements. Loading demand and loading requirements for similar uses shall be considered.
    4. Maneuvering Space for Loading Berths. In addition to the length of the loading berth, additional maneuvering space may be required by the Director in the following cases:

        1. For any uses with over ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross floor area with loading berth access from a principal or minor arterial street;
        2. For high-demand uses with over ten thousand (10,000) square feet of gross floor area with loading berth access from a collector arterial or local access street, especially if located across the street from another high-demand use. When required, the additional maneuvering space shall be designed and arranged to allow the most efficient use of all required loading berths by motor vehicles of the types typically employed by the activities served.

For existing buildings that have previously gone through the design review process these standards may be varied by the Director if the Director determines that the new minor communication facilities would be consistent with the Director's design review decision on the original building; otherwise, these standards may be varied through the administrative design review process provided for in Section 23.41.016.
    3. For existing buildings that have not previously gone through the design review process these standards may be varied through the administrative design review process provided for in Section 23.41.016.



### Chapter 23.58A - INCENTIVE PROVISIONS
#### Subchapter I - General provisions
##### 23.58A.002 - Scope of chapter; general rules

1. This Chapter 23.58A contains rules for incentive programs in areas for which the provisions of the zone specifically refer to this Chapter 23.58A or in zones having an incentive zoning suffix. The provisions in this Chapter 23.58A specify conditions under which extra floor area may be allowed, as exceptions to the otherwise applicable floor area or base height limit, or both, subject to the maximum limits stated in the provisions of the zone and to all other applicable requirements and approvals. Nothing in this Chapter 23.58A authorizes allowance of extra floor area, or the construction or use of any structure, contrary to any other provisions of this Title 23 or Title 25. Developments for which extra floor area is sought may be subject to conditions under other chapters and titles of the Seattle Municipal Code, including without limitation conditions imposed pursuant to Chapter 25.05, Environmental Policies and Procedures.
2. The provisions of this subchapter I apply generally to projects using any of the incentive provisions in this Chapter 23.58A, unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable subchapter of this Chapter 23.58A or in the provisions of the zone.
3. Nothing in this Chapter 23.58A shall be construed to confer on any owner or developer any development rights or property interests. The availability and terms of any allowance of extra floor area depend on the regulations in effect on the relevant date for consideration of a permit application for the project proposing to use such extra floor area, pursuant to Section 23.76.026, notwithstanding any prior approvals, interpretations or agreements by the Director, Housing Director or other official regarding the eligibility of any actual or proposed facility or feature to satisfy conditions for extra floor area.

##### 23.58A.003 - Affordable housing incentive programs: purpose and findings

1. Purpose. The provisions of this Chapter 23.58A that relate to affordable housing are intended to implement affordable housing incentive programs authorized by RCW 36.70A.540, as it may be amended.
2. State law controlling. In case of any irreconcilable conflict with the terms of this Chapter 23.58A related to an affordable housing incentive program, the provisions of RCW 36.70A.540, as amended, shall supersede and control.
3. Findings

    1. Pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70A.540, the City finds that higher income levels are needed to address local housing market conditions throughout the city. The terms of the affordable housing incentive program in this Chapter 23.58A take into account that, for affordable housing not receiving public subsidies, the higher income levels specified in the definition of "income-eligible households" in this Chapter 23.58A, rather than the levels stated for renter and owner occupancy program purposes in the definition of "low-income households" in RCW 36.70A.540, are needed to address local housing market conditions.
    2. The "general area of the development for which a bonus or incentive is provided" under RCW 36.70A.540 is deemed to be the Seattle city limits for all development within the Seattle city limits.

2. If the maximum height limit for residential use is higher than 85 feet, the applicant shall use housing bonus residential floor area pursuant to Section 23.58A.014 to achieve at least 60 percent of the total extra residential floor area on the lot, and, to the extent permitted under the provisions of the zone or this Chapter 23.58A, may use bonus residential floor area for amenities pursuant to Section 23.58A.040 or transfer of transferable development potential pursuant to Section 23.58A.042, or both, for the balance of the extra residential floor area.

##### 23.58A.014 - Bonus residential floor area for affordable housing

The percentage of gross bonus residential floor area obtained through the performance option to be provided as affordable housing may be reduced by the Council below 14 percent of the gross bonus residential floor area to no less than 12 percent of the gross bonus residential floor area as a Type V decision on an official land use map amendment or text amendment when the Council determines that the reduction is needed to accomplish Comprehensive Plan goals and policies or to reflect economic conditions of the area. Applicants may provide affordable housing as part of the development using extra floor area, or by providing or contributing to affordable housing at another location, subject to requirements in subsection 23.58A.014.B.8 and approval in writing by the Director of Housing prior to issuance of any permit after the first building permit for the development using the bonus residential floor area and before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring for the development using the bonus residential floor area is issued.


1. Agreement. The City and the affordable housing owner shall enter into an agreement specifying the affordable housing requirements under this subsection 23.58A.014.B. This agreement shall be executed and recorded prior to issuance and as a condition to issuance of any permit after the first building permit for the development using the bonus residential floor area and before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring for the development using the bonus residential floor area is issued.
2. Duration. Affordable housing shall serve only income-eligible households for a minimum period of 50 years from the later of the date when the agreement between the housing owner and the City is recorded, or the date when the affordable housing becomes available for occupancy as determined by the City.
3. Unit size and distribution. Affordable housing shall be provided in a range of sizes comparable to those units that are available to other residents. To the extent practicable, the number of bedrooms in affordable units must be in the same proportion as the number of bedrooms in units within the entire development. The affordable units shall generally be distributed throughout the development and have substantially the same functionality as the other units in the development.
4. Additional standards for rental housing. For rental housing:

    1. monthly rent, including basic utilities, shall not exceed 30 percent of the income limit for the unit, all as determined by the Director of Housing, for a minimum period of 50 years; and
    2. the housing owner shall submit a report to the Office of Housing annually that documents how the affordable housing meets the terms of the recorded agreement.
5. Additional standards for owner-occupied housing. For owner-occupied housing, the initial sale price of the unit and subsequent sale prices upon resale of the unit during the 50-year affordability period shall be restricted to an amount determined by the Director of Housing to be affordable to an income-eligible household, such that the annualized housing payment for the unit does not exceed 35 percent of the annual income of an income-eligible household, adjusted by the household size expected to occupy the unit based on the number of bedrooms. The method to determine the sale price of the unit, subject to approval by the Director of Housing, includes mortgage principal and interest payments as calculated by prevailing interest rates, real estate taxes, insurance, homeowner association dues and any other housing cost deemed reasonable by the Director of Housing, and requirements relating to down-payment amount and homebuyer contributions. The unit shall be subject to recorded instruments satisfactory to the Director of Housing providing for sale prices on any resale consistent with the affordability restriction on the same basis for a minimum period of 50 years.
6. Additional standards for on-site performance. If the affordable housing is provided within the development using the bonus residential floor area, the affordable housing shall be completed and ready for occupancy at or before the time when a certificate of occupancy is issued for any other units in the development using the bonus residential floor area, and as a condition to any right of the applicant to such a certificate of occupancy.
7. Additional standards for off-site performance. If the affordable housing is not provided within the development using the bonus residential floor area, it may be provided off-site according to the following standards:

    1. Development that uses bonus residential floor area within the South Lake Union Urban Center must provide off-site affordable housing within the South Lake Union Urban Center. Outside the South Lake Union Urban Center, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing that the off-site affordable housing is located within the same urban center or village as the development using the bonus residential floor area or within 1 mile of the development using the bonus residential floor area or that it is infeasible for the off-site affordable housing to be located within this area. If the affordable housing is not located within the same urban center or village as the development using the bonus residential floor area or within 1 mile of the development using the bonus residential floor area, it shall be:

        1. located within Seattle city limits and within 0.5 mile of a light rail or bus rapid transit station; or
        2. if the applicant demonstrates that providing the affordable housing in such a location is also infeasible, then the Director of Housing may allow the affordable housing to be provided within the Seattle city limits and within 0.25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop.
    2. The applicant shall provide to the City an irrevocable letter of credit, or other sufficient security approved by the Director of Housing, prior to issuance and as a condition of issuance of any permit after the first building permit for the development using the bonus residential floor area and before any permit for any construction activity other than for excavation and shoring for the development is issued, unless completion of the affordable housing has already been documented to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing and the affordable housing is subject to recorded restrictions satisfactory to the Director of Housing. The letter of credit or other security shall be in an amount equal to the Payment Option amount calculated according to provisions in subsection 23.58A.014.C, plus an amount equal to interest on such payment. The Director of Housing is authorized to adopt, by rule, terms and conditions of such security including the amount of security and rate of annual interest, conditions on which the City shall have a right to draw on the letter of credit or other security, and terms should the City become entitled to realize on any such security.
    3. Any failure of the affordable housing to satisfy the requirements of this subsection 23.58A.014.B shall not affect the right to maintain or occupy the bonus residential floor area if the Director of Housing certifies to the Director that either:

        1. the applicant has provided the City with a letter of credit or other sufficient security pursuant to subsection 23.58A.014.B.8.b; or
        2. there have been recorded one or more agreements or instruments satisfactory to the Director of Housing providing for occupancy and affordability restrictions on affordable housing with the minimum floor area determined under this Section 23.58A.014, all affordable housing has been completed, and the affordable housing is on a different lot from the bonus residential floor area or is in one or more condominium units separate from the bonus residential floor area under condominium documents acceptable to the Director of Housing.
    4. Unless and until the Director of Housing shall certify as set forth in subsection 23.58A.014.B.8.c, it shall be a continuing permit condition, whether or not expressly stated, for each development obtaining bonus residential floor area based on the provision of housing to which this Section 23.58A.014 applies, that the affordable housing shall be maintained in compliance with the terms of this Section 23.58A.014 and any applicable provisions of the zone, as documented to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing.
8. Limits on subsidies for affordable housing

    1. Except as allowed in subsections 23.58A.014.B.9.b and 23.58A.014.B.9.c, no bonus residential floor area may be earned by providing affordable housing if:

        1. Any person is receiving or will receive with respect to the affordable housing any charitable contributions or public subsidies for development or operation, including, but not limited to, tax exempt bond financing, tax credits, federal loans or grants, City of Seattle housing loans or grants, county housing funds, and State of Washington housing funds; or
        2. The housing is or would be, independent of the requirements for the bonus residential floor area and Chapter 5.73, subject to any restrictions on the income of occupants, rents or sale prices.
    2. For the purpose of this subsection 23.58A.014.B.9, the qualification for and use of property tax exemptions pursuant to Chapter 5.73, or any other program implemented pursuant to chapter 84.14 RCW, does not constitute a subsidy and any related conditions regarding incomes, rent or sale prices do not constitute restrictions.
    3. As an exception to subsection 23.58A.014.B.9.a, the Director of Housing may allow the building or buildings in which the affordable housing is located to be financed in part with subsidies based on the determination that:

        1. the total amount of affordable housing is at least 300 net residential square feet greater than the amount otherwise required through the performance option under this Section 23.58A.014;
        2. the public benefit of the affordable housing, as measured through an economic analysis, exceeds the amount of the payment-in-lieu that would otherwise be paid by at least the value of any subsidies; and
        3. the subsidies being allowed would not be sufficient to leverage private funds for production of the affordable housing, under restrictions as required for the performance option, without additional City subsidy in an amount greater than the payment-in-lieu amount that would otherwise be paid.
9. Fees shall be paid by the applicant and owner of affordable housing to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections and the Office of Housing as specified under Chapter 22.900G.

1. Scope; general rule. This Section 23.58A.014 applies to bonus residential floor area for affordable housing allowed on lots for which applicable sections of this Title 23 expressly refer to this Chapter 23.58A. To obtain bonus residential floor area for affordable housing, the applicant may use the performance option, the payment option, or a combination of these options, in accordance with this Section 23.58A.014 and subject to the provisions of the zone. However, where the maximum allowable height under the applicable provisions of the zone is 85 feet or less, the applicant may only use the performance option.
2. Performance option

    1. Amount of affordable housing. An applicant using the performance option shall provide affordable housing with a gross floor area at least equal to the greatest of

        1. 14 percent of the gross bonus residential floor area obtained through the performance option, except that an applicant may elect to provide affordable housing equal to eight percent of the gross bonus residential floor area obtained through the performance option if the housing is affordable to, and restricted to occupancy by, households with incomes no higher than 50 percent of median income as defined by Section 23.84A.025; or
        2. 300 net residential square feet; or
        3. any minimum floor area specified in the provisions of the zone.
3. Payment option. The payment option is available only where the maximum height for residential use under the provisions of the zone is more than 85 feet and only if the Director determines that the payment achieves a result equal to or better than providing the affordable housing on-site and the payment does not exceed the approximate cost of developing the same number and quality of housing units that would otherwise be developed; or for development of a single purpose commercial structure in zones with an incentive zoning suffix. The amount of the in lieu payment made at the time specified in subsection 23.58A.014.C.2 shall be based on the payment amount that is in effect when vesting of a Master Use Permit occurs under Section 23.76.026.

    1. Amount of payments.

        1. Except as provided in subsection 23.58A.014.C.1.b, in lieu of all or part of the performance option, an applicant may pay to the City $15.15 per square foot of gross bonus residential floor area.
        2. In the South Lake Union Urban Center, in lieu of all or part of the performance option, an applicant may pay to the City $21.68 per square foot of gross bonus residential floor area. On July 1, 2014 and on the same day annually thereafter the in-lieu payment amount in this subsection 23.58A.014.C.1.b shall automatically adjust in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index, from the time the in-lieu payment was established or last adjusted.
    2. Timing of payments. Cash payments shall be made prior to issuance and as a condition to issuance of any permit after the first building permit for a development and before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued, unless the applicant elects in writing to defer payment. If the applicant elects to defer payment, then the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for the development shall be conditioned upon payment of the full amount of the cash payment determined under this Section 23.58A.014, plus an interest factor equal to that amount multiplied by the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, West Region, All Items, 1982-84=100, as published monthly, from the last month prior to the date when payment would have been required if deferred payment had not been elected, to the last month for which data are available at the time of payment. If the index specified in this subsection 23.58A.014.C.2 is not available for any reason, the Director shall select a substitute cost of living index. In no case shall the interest factor be less than zero.
    3. Deposit and use of payments. Cash payments in lieu of affordable housing shall be deposited in a special account established solely to support the development of housing for income-eligible households as defined in this Chapter 23.58A. Earnings on balances in the special account shall accrue to that account. The Director of Housing shall use cash payments and any earnings thereon to support the development of housing for income-eligible households in any manner now or hereafter permitted by RCW 36.70A.540. Uses of funds may include the City's costs to administer housing for income-eligible households, not to exceed 10 percent of the payments into the special account. Housing for income-eligible households funded wholly or in part with cash payments shall be located within the Seattle city limits.
4. If a Master Use Permit application includes establishment of bonus residential floor area and the proposed development entails demolition of a building containing four or more dwelling units occupied as rental housing within 18 months prior to that Master Use Permit application, then the amount of affordable housing to be provided under subsection 23.58A.014.B.1 is increased by the number of units within the building or buildings to be demolished that were rented to tenants who received or are eligible to receive a tenant relocation assistance payment under Chapter 22.210. The additional affordable housing is subject to the following requirements:

    1. For the first 50 years of operation, the affordable housing shall be affordable to households with incomes at or below 50 percent of median income as defined by Section 23.84A.025.
    2. A cash payment in lieu of the additional affordable housing is not permitted.
    3. If the additional affordable housing is not being provided in the development using the bonus residential floor area, the additional affordable housing units shall be completed, including issuance of a certificate of occupancy, within three years from the time when a certificate of occupancy is issued for any units in the development seeking bonus residential floor area, except that the Director may extend the time for completion if the Director finds that:

        1. The failure to complete the affordable housing is due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control;
        2. The applicant has been acting and may reasonably be expected to continue to act in good faith and with due diligence; and
        3. The affordable housing will be completed within a reasonable time.
5. The Director and the Director of Housing are authorized jointly to adopt rules to interpret and implement the provisions of this Section 23.58A.014.


#### Subchapter III - Extra Nonresidential Floor Area
##### 23.58A.020 - Scope of subchapter

This subchapter III includes provisions under which applicants may gain extra nonresidential floor area in development for which the applicable provisions of the zone expressly refer to this Chapter 23.58A.


##### 23.58A.022 - Methods to achieve extra nonresidential floor area

The method to achieve extra nonresidential floor area shall be as provided in the provisions of the underlying zone. If the underlying zone does not provide methods to achieve extra nonresidential floor area, the methods shall be:


1. If the maximum height limit for nonresidential use is 85 feet or less, all extra nonresidential floor area shall be housing and child care bonus nonresidential floor area pursuant to Section 23.58A.024, or housing TDR pursuant to Section 23.58A.042, or both.
2. If the maximum height limit for nonresidential use is greater than 85 feet, the applicant shall use housing and child care bonus nonresidential floor area pursuant to Section 23.58A.024, or housing TDR pursuant to Section 23.58A.042, or both, to achieve 75 percent of total extra nonresidential floor area on the lot, and, to the extent permitted under the provisions of the zone and this Chapter 23.58A, shall use bonus nonresidential floor area for amenities pursuant to Section 23.58A.040, or TDR pursuant to Section 23.58A.042, or both, for the balance of the extra nonresidential floor area.

##### 23.58A.024 - Bonus non-residential floor area for affordable housing and child care

1. Scope; general rule. This Section 23.58A.024 applies to bonus non-residential floor area for affordable housing and child care allowed on lots for which applicable sections of this Title 23 expressly refer to this Chapter 23.58A. To obtain bonus non-residential floor area for affordable housing and child care, the applicant may use the performance option, the payment option, or a combination of these options, in accordance with this Section 23.58A.024 and subject to the provisions of the zone.
2. Performance option for housing

    1. Amount of affordable housing. An applicant using the housing performance option shall provide affordable housing with a gross floor area at least equal to 15.6 percent of gross bonus non-residential floor area obtained through the performance option.
    2. Agreement. The City and the affordable housing owner shall enter into an agreement specifying the affordable housing requirements under this subsection 23.58A.024.B. This agreement shall be executed and recorded prior to issuance and as a condition to issuance of any permit after the first building permit for the development using the bonus non-residential floor area and before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring for the development is issued.
    3. Duration. Affordable housing shall serve only income-eligible households for a minimum period of 50 years from the later of the date when the agreement between the housing owner and the City is recorded, or the date when the affordable housing becomes available for occupancy as determined by the City.
    4. Unit size and distribution. Affordable housing shall be provided in a range of sizes comparable to those units that are available to other residents. To the extent practicable, the number of bedrooms in affordable units must be in the same proportion as the number of bedrooms in units within the entire development. The affordable units shall generally be distributed throughout the development and have substantially the same functionality as the other units in the development.
    5. Additional standards for rental housing. For rental housing:

        1. monthly rent, including basic utilities, shall not exceed 30 percent of the income limit for the unit, all as determined by the Director of Housing, for a minimum period of 50 years; and
        2. the housing owner shall submit a report to the Office of Housing annually that documents how the affordable housing meets the terms of the recorded agreement.
    6. Additional standards for owner-occupied housing. For owner-occupied housing, the initial sale price of the unit and subsequent sale prices upon resale of the unit during the 50-year affordability period shall be restricted to an amount determined by the Director of Housing to be affordable to an income-eligible household, such that the annualized housing payment for the unit does not exceed 35 percent of the annual income of an income-eligible household, adjusted by the household size expected to occupy the unit based on the number of bedrooms. The method to determine the sale price of the unit, subject to approval by the Director of Housing, includes mortgage principal and interest payments as calculated by prevailing interest rates, real estate taxes, insurance, homeowner association dues and any other housing cost deemed reasonable by the Director of Housing, and requirements relating to down-payment amount and homebuyer contributions. The unit shall be subject to recorded instruments satisfactory to the Director of Housing providing for sale prices on any resale consistent with the affordability restriction on the same basis for a minimum period of 50 years.
    7. Additional standards for on-site performance. If the affordable housing is provided within the development using the bonus non-residential floor area, the affordable housing shall be completed and ready for occupancy at or before the time when a certificate of occupancy is issued for any chargeable floor area in the development using the bonus non-residential floor area, and as a condition to any right of the applicant to such a certificate of occupancy.
    8. Additional standards for off-site performance. If the affordable housing is not provided within the development using the bonus non-residential floor area, it may be provided off-site according to the following standards:

        1. Developments that use bonus non-residential floor area within the South Lake Union Urban Center shall provide off-site affordable housing within the South Lake Union Urban Center or within one mile of the development using the bonus non-residential floor area and no more than 0.25 mile from the South Lake Union Urban Center boundary. Outside of the South Lake Union Urban Center, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing that the off-site affordable housing is located within the same urban center or village as the development using the bonus residential floor area or within one mile of the development using the bonus non-residential floor area or that it is infeasible for the off-site affordable housing to be located within this area. If the affordable housing is not located within the same urban center or village as the development using the bonus residential floor area or within one mile of the development using the bonus non-residential floor area, it shall be located either:

            1. within the Seattle city limits and within 0.5 mile of a light rail or bus rapid transit station; or
            2. if the applicant demonstrates that providing the affordable housing in such a location is also infeasible, then the Director of Housing may allow the affordable housing to be provided in the city within the Seattle city limits and within 0.25 mile of a bus or streetcar stop.
        2. The applicant shall provide to the City an irrevocable letter of credit, or other sufficient security approved by the Director of Housing, prior to and as a condition of issuance of any permit after the first building permit for the development using the bonus nonresidential floor area and before any permit for construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued, unless completion of the affordable housing has already been documented to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing and the affordable housing is subject to recorded restrictions satisfactory to the Director of Housing. The letter of credit or other security shall be in an amount equal to the payment option amount calculated according to provisions in subsection 23.58A.024.D, plus an amount equal to interest on such payment. The Director of Housing is authorized to adopt, by rule, terms and conditions of such security including the amount of security and rate of annual interest, conditions on which the City shall have a right to draw on the letter of credit or other security, and terms should the City become entitled to realize on any such security.
        3. Any failure of the affordable housing to satisfy the requirements of this subsection 23.58A.024.B shall not affect the right to maintain or occupy the bonus nonresidential floor area if the Director of Housing certifies to the Director that either:

            1. the applicant has provided the City with a letter of credit or other sufficient security pursuant to subsection 23.58A.024.B.8.b; or
            2. there have been recorded one or more agreements or instruments satisfactory to the Director of Housing providing for occupancy and affordability restrictions on affordable housing with the minimum floor area determined under this Section 23.58A.024, all affordable housing has been completed, and the affordable housing is on a different lot from the bonus nonresidential floor area or is in one or more condominium units separate from the bonus development under condominium documents acceptable to the Director of Housing.
        4. Unless and until the Director of Housing certifies as set forth in subsection 23.58A.024.B.8.c, it shall be a continuing permit condition, whether or not expressly stated, for each development obtaining bonus nonresidential floor area based on the provision of housing to which this Section 23.58A.024 applies, that the affordable housing shall be maintained in compliance with the terms of this Section 23.58A.024 and any applicable provisions of the zone, as documented to the satisfaction of the Director of Housing.
    9. Limits on subsidies for affordable housing

        1. Except as allowed in subsection 23.58A.014.B.9.b and 23.58A.014.B.9.c, no bonus nonresidential floor area may be earned by providing affordable housing if:

            1. Any person is receiving or will receive with respect to the affordable housing any charitable contributions or public subsidies for housing development or operation, including, but not limited to, tax exempt bond financing, tax credits, federal loans or grants, City of Seattle housing loans or grants, county housing funds, and State of Washington housing funds; or
            2. The housing is or would be, independent of the requirements for the bonus nonresidential floor area and Chapter 5.73, subject to any restrictions on the income of occupants, rents or sale prices.
        2. For the purpose of this subsection 23.58A.024.B.9, the qualification for and use of property tax exemptions pursuant to Chapter 5.73, or any other program implemented pursuant to RCW 84.14, does not constitute a subsidy and any related conditions regarding incomes, rent or sale prices do not constitute restrictions.
        3. As an exception to subsection 23.58A.024.B.9.a.1, the Director of Housing may allow the building or buildings in which the affordable housing is located to be financed in part with subsidies based on the determination that:

            1. the total amount of affordable housing is at least 300 net residential square feet greater than the amount otherwise required through the performance option under this Section 23.58A.024;
            2. the public benefit of the affordable housing, as measured through an economic analysis, exceeds the amount of the payment-in-lieu that would otherwise be paid by at least the value of any subsidies; and
            3. the subsidies being allowed would not be sufficient to leverage private funds for production of the affordable housing, under restrictions as required for the performance option, without additional City subsidy in an amount greater than the payment-in-lieu amount that would otherwise be paid.
    10. Fees shall be paid by the applicant and owner of affordable housing to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections and the Office of Housing as specified under Section 22.900G.015.
3. Performance option for child care

    1. For each square foot of nonresidential bonus floor area allowed under this Section 23.58A.024, in addition to providing housing pursuant to subsection 23.58A.024.B or an alternative cash contribution pursuant to subsection 23.58A.024.D, an applicant using the child care performance option shall provide fully improved child care facility space sufficient for 0.000127 of a child care slot. The minimum interior space in the child care facility for each child care slot shall comply with all applicable state and local regulations governing the operation of licensed childcare providers. Child care facility space shall be deemed provided only if the applicant causes the space to be newly constructed or newly placed in child care use after the submission of a permit application for the development intended to use the bonus floor area, except as provided in subsection 23.58A.024.C.3.f. If any contribution or subsidy in any form is made by any public entity to the acquisition, development, financing or improvement of any child care facility, then any portion of the space in such facility determined by the Human Services Director to be attributable to such contribution or subsidy shall not be considered as provided by any applicant other than that public entity.
    2. Child care space shall be provided on the same lot as the development using the bonus nonresidential floor area, or on another lot within a distance of 0.25 mile of the development using the bonus nonresidential floor area.
    3. Child care space shall be contained in a child care facility satisfying the following standards:

        1. The child care facility and accessory exterior space shall be approved for licensing by the State of Washington Department of Early Learning and any other applicable state or local governmental agencies responsible for the regulation of licensed child care providers.
        2. At least 20 percent of the number of child care slots for which space is provided as a condition of bonus nonresidential floor area shall be reserved for, and affordable to, families with annual incomes at or below the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Low Income Standard for Section 8 Housing based on family size or, if such standard shall no longer be published, a standard established by the Human Services Director based generally on 80 percent of the median family income of the Metropolitan Statistical Area, or division thereof, that includes Seattle, adjusted for family size. Child care slots shall be deemed to meet these conditions if they serve, and are limited to,

            1. children receiving child care subsidy from the City of Seattle, King County or State Department of Early Learning, or
            2. children whose families have annual incomes no higher than the above standard who are charged according to a sliding fee scale such that the fees paid by any family do not exceed the amount it would be charged, exclusive of subsidy, if the family were enrolled in the City of Seattle Child Care Assistance Program.
        3. Child care space provided to satisfy bonus conditions shall be dedicated to child care use, consistent with the terms of this Section 23.58A.024, for 20 years. The dedication shall be established by a recorded covenant, running with the land, and enforceable by the City, signed by the owner of the lot where the child care facility is located, or the long-term lessee of the child care space under terms acceptable to the Human Services Director, and by the owner of the lot where the bonus floor area is used, if different from the lot of the child care facility. The child care facility shall be maintained in operation, with adequate staffing, at least 11 hours per day, five days per week, and 50 weeks per year.
        4. Space for which a bonus is or has been allowed under any other section of this Title 23 or under former Title 24 shall not be eligible to satisfy the conditions of this Section 23.58A.024.
        5. Unless the applicant is the owner of the child care space and is a duly licensed and experienced child care provider approved by the Human Services Director, the applicant shall provide to the Human Services Director a signed agreement, acceptable to the Human Services Director, with a duly licensed child care provider, under which the child care provider agrees to operate the child care facility consistent with the terms of this Section 23.58A.024 and of the recorded covenant, and to provide reports and documentation to the City to demonstrate such compliance.
        6. One child care facility may fulfill the conditions for a bonus for more than one development if it includes sufficient space, and provides sufficient slots affordable to limited income families, to satisfy the conditions for each such development without any space or child care slot being counted toward the conditions for more than one development. If the child care facility is located on the same lot as one of the developments using the bonus, then the owner of that lot shall be responsible for maintaining compliance with all the requirements applicable to the child care facility; otherwise responsibility for such requirements shall be allocated by agreement in such manner as the Human Services Director may approve. If a child care facility developed to qualify for bonus floor area by one applicant includes space exceeding the amount necessary for the bonus floor area used by that applicant, then to the extent that the voluntary agreement accepted by the Human Services Director from that applicant so provides, such excess space may be deemed provided by the applicant for a later development pursuant to a new voluntary agreement signed by both such applicants and by any other owner of the child care facility, and a modification of the recorded covenant, each in form and substance acceptable to the Human Services Director.
    4. The Human Services Director shall review the design and proposed management plan for any child care facility proposed to qualify for bonus floor area to determine whether it will comply with the terms of this Section 23.58A.024. The allowance of bonus floor area is conditioned upon approval of the design and proposed management plan by the Human Services Director. The child care facility shall be constructed consistent with the design approved by the Human Services Director and shall be operated for the minimum 20 year term consistent with the management plan approved by the Human Services Director, in each case with only such modifications as shall be approved by the Human Services Director. If the proposed management plan includes provisions for payment of rent or occupancy costs by the provider, the management plan shall include a detailed operating budget, staffing ratios, and other information requested by the Human Services Director to assess whether the child care facility may be economically feasible and able to deliver quality services.
    5. The Human Services Director is authorized to accept a voluntary agreement for the provision of a child care facility to satisfy bonus conditions and related agreements and instruments consistent with this Section 23.58A.024. The voluntary agreement may provide, in case a child care facility is not maintained in continuous operation consistent with this subsection 23.58A.024.C at any time within the minimum 20 year period, for the City's right to receive payment of a prorated amount of the alternative cash contribution that then would be applicable to a new development seeking bonus nonresidential floor area, with any adjustments for changes in costs that the Human Services Director may deem appropriate. The Human Services Director may require security or evidence of adequate financial responsibility, or both, as a condition to acceptance of an agreement under this subsection 23.58A.024.C. Review and approval of any proposed facilities, plans or other matters by the Human Services Director is in the interest of the City and the general public and not for the particular benefit of any persons or class, and shall not constitute any assurance to any person that any facility or its operations will satisfy any health, safety or other standards or criteria.
4. Payment option

    1. Amount of payments. The amount of the in lieu payment made at the time specified in subsection 23.58A.024.D.2 shall be based on the payment amount that is in effect when vesting of a Master Use Permit occurs under Section 23.76.026.

        1.

In lieu of all or part of the performance option for child care, the applicant may provide a cash contribution to the City of $3.25 per gross square foot of bonus nonresidential floor area to be used for child care facilities, to be administered by the Human Services Department.
        2. Affordable housing and child care in the South Lake Union Urban Center.

            1. In lieu of all or part of the performance option for affordable housing an applicant may provide a cash contribution to the City for affordable housing according to the following schedule:

                2. From January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2014, $22.88 per gross square foot of bonus nonresidential floor area;
                3. July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015, the sum of $24.95 per gross square foot of bonus nonresidential floor area plus the product of $24.95 per gross square foot of bonus nonresidential floor area times the 2013 annual average change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index; and
                4. On July 1, 2015 and on the same day annually thereafter the in-lieu payment amount in this subsection 23.58A.024.D.1.b.1 shall automatically adjust in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index, from January 1, 2014, or the time the in-lieu payment was last adjusted, whichever is later.
            2. In lieu of all or part of the performance option for child care, an applicant may provide a cash contribution to the City to be used for child care facilities, to be administered by the Human Services Department, according to the following schedule:

July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015, the sum of $4.32 per gross square foot of bonus nonresidential floor area plus the product of $4.32 per gross square foot of bonus nonresidential floor area times the 2013 annual average change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index; and
                4. On July 1, 2015 and on the same day annually thereafter the in-lieu payment amount in this subsection 23.58A.024.D.1.b.2 shall automatically adjust in proportion to the change in the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area, All Items (1982-84 = 100), as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or successor index, from January 1, 2014, or the time the in-lieu payment was last adjusted, whichever is later.
    2. Timing of payments. Cash payments shall be made prior to issuance and as a condition to issuance of any permit after the first building permit for a development using the bonus nonresidential floor area and before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued.
    3. Deposit and use of payments. Cash payments in lieu of affordable housing and child care facilities shall be deposited in special accounts established solely to support the development of housing for income-eligible households and child care facilities. Earnings on balances in the special accounts shall accrue to those accounts.

        1. The Director of Housing shall use cash payments in lieu of affordable housing and any earnings thereon to support the development of housing for income-eligible households in any manner now or hereafter permitted by RCW 36.70A.540. Uses of funds may include the City's costs to administer the housing for income-eligible households, not to exceed 10 percent of the payments into the special accounts.

#### Subchapter IV - Extra Floor Area In Zones With An Incentive Zoning Suffix
##### 23.58A.025 - Scope of subchapter

This subchapter IV includes provisions under which applicants may gain extra floor area for development in zones with an incentive zoning suffix.


##### 23.58A.026 - Application of floor area limits in zones with an incentive zoning suffix

In zones with an incentive zoning suffix, extra floor area may be allowed in addition to the maximum gross floor area allowed by the FAR limit indicated by the incentive zoning suffix. All extra floor area shall be considered extra residential floor area regardless of the use. Extra floor area may be gained up to the maximum non-exempt gross floor area allowed by the FAR limit of the applicable Commercial or Multifamily zone. For single purpose commercial structures in zones with an incentive zoning suffix, extra floor area may be allowed when the applicant qualifies by using the performance option or the payment option in accordance with Section 23.58A.014, or a combination of these options. The provisions of this Chapter 23.58A under which applicants may gain extra residential floor area shall apply.


##### 23.58A.028 - Application of incentive zoning in legislative rezones


1. Within an overlay district, other than the Station Area Overlay District, where overlay district provisions for FAR prevail over the FAR provisions of the underlying zone, the FAR prescribed in the overlay provisions shall be used to establish the Base FAR and/or Base Residential Floor Area.

1. When the City Council approves a Type V legislative rezone pursuant to Section 23.76.062, the Council may elect to apply the incentive zoning provisions of this chapter to all or part of the area being rezoned. If the Council decides to apply this chapter, then the maximum floor area ratio permitted within the area subject to this chapter is the floor area ratio of the previous zone, as described in subsection 23.58A.028.B below, unless the applicant for project approval gains additional floor area ratio pursuant to this chapter.
2. For the sole purpose of establishing base FAR and/or base residential floor area under this chapter, the following shall be applied as the base FAR and/or base residential floor area when rezoning from one of the following zones:

    1. Single-Family zones: .75
    2. Lowrise 1 Zones: 1.2
    3. Lowrise 2 Zones: 1.3
    4. Lowrise 3 Zones:

        1. Outside urban centers, urban villages, and the Station Area Overlay District: 1.6
        2. Inside urban centers, urban villages, and the Station Area Overlay District: 2.0
    5. Commercial zones as shown in Table A for 23.58A.028.


#### Subchapter V - Provisions for Extra Residential and Nonresidential Floor Area
##### 23.58A.040 - Bonus floor area for open space amenities

1. Findings. The City Council finds that:

    1. Amenities, including public open space, are an important aspect of livability in areas targeted in the Comprehensive Plan for concentrated housing and employment growth. To address this need, the Comprehensive Plan establishes goals for the amount and distribution of open space. These goals are consistent with national standards developed to assist communities with planning to provide adequate open space serving specified population needs.
    2. Developments that add density will increase demand for public open space. If additional public open space is voluntarily provided to offset additional demand, the impacts on available open space resources will be mitigated.
    3. Within Highrise zones, the average amount of public open space, including breathing room open space, needed to accommodate residential development is at least 0.14 square feet of open space per gross square foot of residential floor area in a development.
2. Voluntary agreements for amenities. Where expressly permitted by the provisions of the zone, an applicant may achieve bonus floor area in part through a voluntary agreement for provision of amenities to mitigate impacts of the development, subject to the limits in this Chapter 23.58A.

    1. Except where limited in the provisions of the zone, amenities that may be provided for bonus floor area include:

        1. neighborhood open space;
        2. green street setbacks on lots abutting designated green streets;
        3. green street improvements;
        4. mid-block corridor; and
        5. hillside terrace.
    2. The amenities listed in subsection 23.58A.040.B.1 are referred to as "open space amenities" in this Section 23.58A.040. Mitigation of impacts identified in subsection 23.58A.040.A may be achieved by providing the amenity on the same lot as the development using the bonus floor area or, for green street improvements, in the right-of-way within two blocks of the development using the bonus floor area (the performance option), by a payment-in-lieu of providing the amenity on- or off-site (payment option), or both.
    3. Amenities provided as part of street vacations may not be counted as amenities for the purpose of achieving extra floor area.
3. Performance option

    1. General provisions

        1. An applicant electing to use the performance option shall provide the amenity on the same lot as the development using the bonus floor area, except to the extent a combined lot development is expressly permitted by the provisions of the zone and except for green street improvements that shall be provided within two blocks of the lot. The maximum area of any amenity or combination of amenities provided on a lot eligible for a bonus is established in this subsection 23.58A.040.C and may be further limited by Sections 23.58A.012, 23.58A.022, or the provisions of the zone. Open space amenities shall meet the standards of this subsection 23.58A.040.C in order to qualify for bonus floor area, except as may be authorized by the Director under subsection 23.58A.040.C.4. An open space amenity may also qualify as a required residential amenity to the extent permitted by the provisions of the zone.
        2. Amenities in Downtown zones in South Downtown

            1. In Downtown zones in South Downtown, in order to qualify for bonus residential floor area, amenity features shall satisfy the eligibility conditions of the Downtown Amenity Standards, except as provided in subsection 23.58A.040.C.1.b.2, and shall be consistent with the guidelines of the Downtown Amenity Standards.
            2. The Director may allow departures from the eligibility conditions of the Downtown Amenity Standards, as a Type I decision, if the applicant demonstrates that the amenity better achieves the intent of the Downtown Amenity Standards for that amenity feature, and that the departure is consistent with any applicable criteria for allowing the particular type of departure in the Downtown Amenity Standards.
            3. The Director may condition the approval of an amenity as provided in the Downtown Amenity Standards.
    2. Bonus ratio. Unless otherwise specified in the provisions of the zone, amenities may be used to gain bonus floor area according to the following ratios and subject to the limits of this Section 23.58A.040:

        1. For a neighborhood open space, 7 square feet of bonus floor area per 1 square foot of qualifying neighborhood open space area (7:1).
        2. For a green street setback, 5 square feet of bonus floor area per 1 square foot of qualifying green street setback area (5:1).
        3. For a green street improvement, 5 square feet of bonus floor area per 1 square foot of qualifying green street improvement area (5:1).
        4. For a mid-block corridor, 7 square feet of bonus floor area per 1 square foot of qualifying mid-block corridor area (7:1).
        5. For a residential or nonresidential hillside terrace, 5 square feet of bonus floor area per 1 square foot of qualifying hillside terrace area (5:1).
    3. Maximum open space amenity in Highrise zone. In the Highrise zone, the amount of open space amenity for which bonus floor area may be allowed shall not exceed the lesser of the amount required to mitigate the impact created by the total bonus residential floor area in the development, or 15,000 square feet. For purposes of this Section 23.58A.040, the amount of open space required to mitigate that impact in the Highrise zone is 0.14 square feet of open space amenity per square foot of bonus residential floor area, unless the Director determines, as a Type I decision, that a different ratio applies based on consideration of one or both of the following:

        1. the overall number or density of people anticipated to use or occupy the structure in which bonus floor area will be located, in relation to the total floor area of the structure, is different from the density level of approximately 1.32 persons per 1,000 residential gross square feet, which was used to establish the ratio in subsection 23.58A.040.C, such that a different amount of open space is needed to mitigate the impacts of development;
        2. characteristics or features of the development mitigate the impacts that the anticipated population using or occupying the structure in which bonus floor area will be located would otherwise have on open space needs.
    4. Standards for open space amenities. The following standards apply to open space amenities, except as otherwise specifically stated in the provisions of the zone.

        1. Public access

            1. Public access for open space amenities in Downtown zones is regulated pursuant to subsection 23.58A.040.C.1.b.
            2. Except for green street improvements, open space amenities not in Downtown zones shall be open to the public, without charge, each day of the year for a minimum of ten hours each day for a neighborhood open space and 24 hours each day of the year for a green street setback. The hours of public access identified above shall be during daylight hours, unless there are insufficient daylight hours, in which case the open space shall also be open during nighttime hours for the balance of the hours the open space is to remain open. Public access may be limited temporarily during hours that are otherwise required to be open to the public for necessary maintenance or for reasons of public safety.
            3. Within the open space, property owners, tenants and their agents shall allow members of the public to engage in activities allowed in the public sidewalk environment, except that those activities that would require a street use permit if conducted on the sidewalk may be excluded or restricted. Free speech activities such as hand billing, signature gathering, and holding signs, all without obstructing access to the space, any building, or other adjacent features, and without unreasonably interfering with the enjoyment of the space by others, shall be allowed. While engaged in allowed activities, members of the public may not be asked to leave for any reason other than conduct that unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the space by others unless the space is being closed to the general public consistent with this subsection 23.58A.040.C. No parking, storage or other use may be established on or above the surface of the open space except as provided in subsection 23.58A.040.C.4.b.2.f. Use by motor vehicles of open space for which bonus floor area is granted is not permitted. The open space shall be identified clearly with the City's public open space logo on a plaque placed at a visible location at each street entrance providing access to the amenity. The plaque shall indicate, in letters legible to passersby, the nature of the bonus amenity, its availability for general public access, and additional directional information as needed.
        2. Standards for neighborhood open space

            1. Neighborhood open space in Downtown zones in South Downtown are regulated pursuant to subsection 23.58A.040.C.1.b.
            2. Neighborhood open space not in Downtown zones used to qualify for bonus floor area shall meet the conditions in this subsection 23.58A.040.C.4.b.2, unless an exception is granted by the Director as a Type I decision, based on the Director's determination that, relative to the strict application of the standards, the exception will result in improved public access and use of the space or a better integration of the space with surrounding development.

                1. The open space shall comply with the applicable provisions of this Section 23.58A.040. The open space shall consist of one continuous area with a minimum of 3,000 square feet and a minimum horizontal dimension of 10 feet.
                2. A minimum of 35 percent of the open space shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, bushes and/or trees.
                3. Either permanent or movable seating in an amount equivalent to 1 lineal foot for every 200 square feet of open space shall be available for public use during hours of public access.
                4. The open space shall be located and configured to maximize solar exposure to the space, allow easy access from streets or other abutting public spaces, including access for persons with disabilities, and allow convenient pedestrian circulation through all portions of the open space. The open space shall have a minimum frontage of 30 feet at grade abutting a sidewalk, and be visible from sidewalks on at least one street.
                5. The open space shall be provided at ground level, except that in order to provide level open spaces on steep lots, some separation of multiple levels may be allowed, provided they are physically and visually connected.
                6. Up to 20 percent of the open space may be covered by elements accessory to public use of the open space, including: permanent, freestanding structures, such as retail kiosks, pavilions, or pedestrian shelters; structural overhangs; overhead arcades or other forms of overhead weather protection; and any other features approved by the Director that contribute to pedestrian comfort and active use of the space. The following elements within the open space area may count as open space and are not subject to the percentage coverage limit: temporary kiosks and pavilions, public art, permanent seating that is not reserved for any commercial use, exterior stairs and mechanical assists that provide access to public areas and are available for public use, and any similar features approved by the Director. Seating or tables, or both, may be provided and reserved for customers of restaurants or other uses abutting the open space, but the area reserved for customer seating shall not exceed 15 percent of the open space area or 500 square feet, whichever is less.
        3. Standards for green street setbacks

            1. Green street setbacks in Downtown zones in South Downtown are regulated pursuant to subsection 23.58A.040.C.1.b.
            2. Green street setbacks in Downtown zones outside South Downtown are regulated pursuant to Section 23.49.013.
            3. Green street setbacks not in Downtown zones shall meet the following standards:

                1. Where permitted by the provisions of the zone, bonus floor area may be gained for green street setbacks by development on lots abutting those street segments that are listed or shown as green streets in the provisions of the zone.
                2. A green street setback shall be provided as a setback from a lot line abutting a designated green street. The setback shall be continuous for the length of the frontage of the lot abutting the green street, and a minimum of 50 percent of the setback area eligible for a bonus shall be landscaped. The area of any driveways in the setback area is not included in the bonusable area. For area eligible for a bonus, the average setback from the abutting green street lot line shall not exceed 10 feet, with a maximum setback of 15 feet. The design of the setback area shall allow for public access, such as access to street level uses in abutting structures or access to areas for seating. The Director may grant an exception to the standards in this subsection 23.58A.040.C.4.c.3.b as a Type I decision, based on the Director's determination that the exception is consistent with a green street concept plan, if one exists, established in accordance with Directors Report DR 11-2007, or a successor rule.
        4. Standards for green street improvement. Green street improvements used to qualify for bonus floor area shall be located on a designated green street and shall meet the standards of a city-approved streetscape concept plan or other design document approved by the Director.
        5. Standards for mid-block corridor. Mid-block corridors used to qualify for bonus floor area in Downtown zones in South Downtown are regulated pursuant to subsection 23.58A.040.C.1.b. Mid-block corridors used to qualify for bonus floor area in the Mount Baker Station Area must meet the requirements in the Downtown Amenity Standards.
        6. Standards for hillside terrace. A hillside terrace used to qualify for bonus floor area in South Lake Union or in Downtown zones in South Downtown are regulated pursuant to subsection 23.58A.040.C.1.b.
        7. Declaration. If open space is to be provided for purposes of obtaining bonus floor area, the owners of the lot using the bonus floor area, and of the lot where the open space is provided, if different, shall execute and record a declaration and voluntary agreement in a form acceptable to the Director identifying the bonus amenities; acknowledging that the right to develop and occupy a portion of the gross floor area on the lot using the bonus floor area is based upon the long-term provision and maintenance of the open space and that development is restricted in the open space; and committing to provide and maintain the open space.
        8. Identification

            1. Open space amenities in Downtown zones in South Downtown shall meet the identification conditions of the Downtown Amenity Standards.
            2. Open space amenities not in Downtown zones shall be identified clearly with the City's public open space logo on a plaque placed at a visible location at each street entrance providing access to the amenity. The plaque shall indicate, in letters legible to passersby, the nature of the bonus amenity, its availability for general public access, and additional directional information as needed.
        9. Duration; alteration. Except as provided for in this subsection 23.58A.040.C.4.i, the owners of the lot using the bonus floor area and of the lot where the open space amenity is located, if different, including all successors, shall provide and maintain the open space amenities for which bonus floor area is granted, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Section 23.58A.040, for as long as the bonus floor area gained by the open space amenities exists. An open space amenity for which bonus floor area has been granted may be altered or removed only to the extent that either or both of the following occur, and alteration or removal may be further restricted by the provisions of the zone and by conditions of any applicable permit:

            1. The bonus floor area permitted in return for the specific open space amenity is removed or converted to a use for which bonus floor area is not required under the provisions of the zone; or
            2. An amount of bonus floor area equal to that allowed for the open space amenity that is to be altered or removed is provided through alternative means consistent with the provisions of the zone and provisions for allowing bonus floor area in this Chapter 23.58A.
4. Payment option

    1. There is no payment in lieu option for open space amenities other than neighborhood open space.
    2. Payment in lieu of providing neighborhood open space

        1. In lieu of all or part of the performance option for neighborhood open space, an applicant may pay to the City an amount determined pursuant to this subsection 23.58A.040.D if the Director determines that the payment will contribute to public open space improvements abutting the lot or in the vicinity; that the improvements will meet the additional need for open space caused by the development and are feasible within a reasonable time; and that the applicant agrees to the specific improvements or to the general nature and location of the improvements.
        2. The amount of the payment is determined by multiplying the number of square feet of land that would be provided as neighborhood open space, by the sum of an estimated land value per square foot based on recent transactions in the area and an average square foot cost for open space improvements. The dollar amount per square foot shall be determined by the Director based on any relevant information submitted by the applicant, and any other data related to land values and costs that the Director considers reliable.
        3. Cash payments shall be made prior to issuance and as a condition to issuance of any permit after the first building permit for a development and before any permit for any construction activity other than excavation and shoring is issued.
        4. Any payment in lieu of providing neighborhood open space shall be deposited in a dedicated fund or account solely to support acquisition or development of public open space within 0.25 mile of the lot using the bonus floor area, or within another area prescribed by the provisions of the zone, or at another location where the applicant and the Director agree that it will mitigate the direct impacts of the development, and the payment shall be expended within five years of receipt for such purposes.

##### 23.58A.042 - Transferable development potential (TDP) and rights (TDR)

1. Scope and applicability

    2. Whether a lot may be eligible as a TDP or TDR sending site is determined by the provisions of the zone in which the lot is located. To be eligible as a sending lot for a specific category of TDP or TDR defined in this Chapter 23.58A, the lot shall satisfy the applicable conditions of this Section 23.58A.042 and definitions in Chapter 23.84A except to the extent otherwise expressly stated in the provisions of the zone. Whether a lot is eligible as a TDP or TDR receiving lot, whether the lot may receive TDP or TDR from another lot, and what categories of TDP or TDR the lot may receive are determined by the provisions of the zone. The transfer and use of TDP or TDR on any receiving lot are subject to the limits and conditions in this Chapter 23.58A, the provisions of the zone, and all other applicable provisions of this Title 23.
2. General standards for sending lots

    1. TDP calculation. The maximum amount of TDP floor area that may be transferred from a sending lot is the amount by which the residential floor area allowed under the base floor area ratio, or floor area that could be allowed under the base residential height as determined by the Director if no base residential floor area exists, exceeds the sum of:

        1. any nonexempt floor area existing on the sending lot; plus
        2. any TDP or TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.
    2. TDR calculation. The maximum amount of TDR floor area that may be transferred from a sending lot is the amount by which the nonresidential floor area allowed under the base floor area ratio of the sending lot exceeds the sum of:

        1. any nonexempt floor area existing on the sending lot; plus
        2. any TDP or TDR previously transferred from the sending lot.
    3. Floor area limit after transfer. After TDP or TDR is transferred from a sending lot, the total amount of residential and nonresidential floor area that may then be established on the sending lot, other than floor area exempt from limits on floor area under the provisions of the zone, shall be as follows:

        1. The amount of residential floor area that may be established shall be the base residential floor area, or floor area that could be allowed under the base residential height as determined by the Director if no base residential floor area exists, plus any net amount of TDP previously transferred to that lot, minus the total of the existing nonexempt floor area on the lot and the amount of TDP or TDR transferred from the lot; and
        2. The amount of nonresidential floor area that may be established shall be the base nonresidential floor area, plus any net amount of TDR previously transferred to that lot, minus the total of the existing nonexempt floor area on the lot and the amount of TDP or TDR transferred from the lot.
3. Standards for Landmark TDP or TDR sending lots. Landmark structures on sending lots from which Landmark TDP or TDR is transferred shall be rehabilitated and maintained as required by the Landmarks Preservation Board.
4. Standards for open space TDP or TDR sending sites. The following standards apply unless provisions of the zone state otherwise:

    1. General conditions. Open space TDP or TDR sites shall meet the following conditions, unless an exception is granted by the Director through subsection 23.58A.042.D.2:

        1. Each portion of the open space shall be accessible from each other portion of the open space without leaving the open space.
        2. The open space shall have a minimum area of 5,000 square feet.
        3. The open space shall be directly accessible from the sidewalk or another public open space, including access for persons with disabilities.
        4. The open space shall be at ground level, except that in order to provide level open spaces on steep lots, some separation of multiple levels may be allowed, provided they are physically and visually connected.
        5. No more than 20 percent of the open space may be occupied by any above grade structures.
        6. A minimum of 35 percent of the open space shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, bushes, and/or trees.
        7. Either permanent or movable seating in an amount equivalent to 1 lineal foot for every 200 square feet of open space shall be available for public use during hours of public access.
        8. The open space shall be located and configured to maximize solar exposure to the space, allow easy access from streets or other abutting public spaces, including access for persons with disabilities, and allow convenient pedestrian circulation through all portions of the open space.
        9. The lot shall be located a minimum of 0.25 mile from the closest lot approved by the Director as a separate open space TDP or TDR site, unless the lot is abutting another TDP or TDR site and is designed to be integrated with the other TDP or TDR site.
        10. The open space shall be open to the public, without charge, each day of the year for a minimum of ten hours each day during daylight hours, unless there are insufficient daylight hours, in which case the open space shall also be open during nighttime hours for the balance of the hours the open space is to remain open. Public access may be limited temporarily during hours that are otherwise required to be open to the public for necessary maintenance or for reasons of public safety.
        11. Within the open space, property owners, tenants and their agents shall allow members of the public to engage in activities allowed in the public sidewalk environment, except that those activities that would require a street use permit if conducted on the sidewalk may be excluded or restricted. Free speech activities such as hand billing, signature gathering, and holding signs, all without obstructing access to the space, any building, or other adjacent features, and without unreasonably interfering with the enjoyment of the space by others, shall be allowed. While engaged in allowed activities, members of the public may not be asked to leave for any reason other than conduct that unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the space by others unless the space is being closed to the general public consistent with subsection 23.58A.042.D.1.j.
        12. The open space shall be identified clearly with the City's public open space logo on a plaque placed at a visible location at each street entrance providing access to the amenity. The plaque shall indicate, in letters legible to passersby, the nature of the bonus amenity, its availability for general public access, and additional directional information as needed.
        13. Unless the open space will be in public ownership, the applicant shall make adequate provision to ensure the permanent maintenance of the open space.
    2. Special exception for open space TDP or TDR sites. The Director may grant, or grant with conditions, an exception to the standards for open space TDP or TDR sites in this subsection 23.58A.042.D and any applicable Director's Rules, as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permit and Council Land Use Decisions. In determining whether to grant, grant with conditions, or deny a request for special exception under this subsection 23.58A.042.D.2, the Director shall consider:

        1. the extent to which the exception would result in an open space TDP or TDR site that better meets the intent of the provisions of this subsection 23.58A.042.D; and

8. Time of determination of TDP or TDR eligible for transfer. The eligibility of a sending lot to transfer TDP or TDR, and the amount transferable from a sending lot, shall be determined as of the date of transfer from the sending lot and shall not be affected by the date of any application, permit decision or other action for any development seeking to use the TDP or TDR.
9. Reservation in deed. Any TDP or TDR eligible for transfer may be reserved in the conveyance of title to an eligible sending lot, by the express terms of the deed or other instrument of conveyance reserving a specified amount of TDP or TDR, provided that an instrument acceptable to the Director is recorded binding the lot to the terms and conditions for eligibility to send TDP or TDR under this Section 23.58A.042. Any TDP or TDR so reserved shall be considered transferred from that lot and later may be conveyed by deed without participation of the owner of the lot.

### Chapter 23.58B - AFFORDABLE HOUSING IMPACT MITIGATION PROGRAM FOR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT

Sections:

#### 23.58B.005 - Purpose

The purpose of this Chapter 23.58B is to mitigate certain adverse impacts of development of new commercial floor area on the need for affordable housing for the households of new workers having lower-wage jobs. Chapter 23.58B provides for voluntary agreements for mitigation of affordable housing impacts associated with new commercial floor area. The mitigation provided in this Chapter 23.58B is not intended to eliminate all affordable housing impacts of new commercial floor area.


#### 23.58B.010 - Intent for implementation

1. Application of this Chapter 23.58B

    1. The provisions of this Chapter 23.58B apply in areas for which the provisions of the zone specifically refer to this Chapter 23.58B, or through the terms of a contract rezone in accordance with Section 23.34.004. The Council intends that references to this Chapter 23.58B be made in the provisions of zones in conjunction with:

        1. Land Use Code amendments increasing commercial development capacity in the zone through increases in allowable FAR and/or height or other measures;
        2. Land Use Map amendments increasing commercial development capacity in an area; or
        3. A combination of Land Use Code and Land Use Map amendments increasing commercial development capacity in an area.
    2. The Council intends that the initial implementation phase of enacting amendments described in subsection 23.58B.010.A.1 will consist of:

        1. An increase in FAR and/or height for all zones in the Downtown and South Lake Union Urban Centers except the Downtown Harborfront 1 (DH-1), Pike Market Mixed (PMM), Seattle Mixed 85/65-160 (SM 85/65-160), Seattle Mixed 85-240 (SM 85-240), and Commercial 2-40 (C2-40) zones to be enacted no later than September 2016;
        2. Zone-wide increases in development capacity in all Neighborhood Commercial (NC), Commercial (C), Seattle Mixed (SM), and Industrial Commercial (IC) zones outside the Downtown and South Lake Union Urban Centers to be enacted no later than September 2017; and
        3. Increases in development capacity through rezones of any portions of the University District that are upzoned in accordance with the University District urban design framework process.
2. Amendment of payment and performance amounts

    1. Initial implementation phase review. The Council recognizes that amendments to the payment and performance amounts provided in this Chapter 23.58B may be needed during the initial implementation phase described in subsection 23.58B.010.A.2 to further the target production level of no fewer than 6,000 net new rent and income restricted affordable units for households with incomes no higher than 60 percent of median income over a ten-year period described in the July 13, 2015 Statement of Intent for Basic Framework for Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and Commercial Linkage Fee. Such amendments could include changes to the payment and performance amounts in Table A for 23.58B.040, Table B for 23.58B.040, Table A for 23.58B.050, and Table B for 23.58B.050, and adding amounts for additional zones or portions of zones in connection with rezones of specific subareas such as portions of the University District. The Council intends that amendments during the initial implementation phase be preceded by a robust stakeholder engagement process including representatives of the for-profit and non-profit development sectors who participated in the July 13, 2015 Statement of Intent for Basic Framework for Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and Commercial Linkage Fee.
    2. Ongoing review. The Council directs that, during the first six months of 2018 and every two years after July 1, 2018, the Director prepare a report on the performance of the mandatory inclusionary housing program described in the July 13, 2015 Statement of Intent for Basic Framework for Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and Commercial Linkage Fee, and the affordable housing impact mitigation program provided in this Chapter 23.58B, including the amount of payments collected under the payment option, the number of affordable housing units produced and preserved with such payments, and the number of affordable housing units constructed under the performance option. Units produced under the mandatory inclusionary housing program described in the July 13, 2015 Statement of Intent for Basic Framework for Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and Commercial Linkage Fee, and the affordable housing impact mitigation program provided in this Chapter 23.58B, shall be measured as net new units. Existing rent and income restricted affordable units demolished for development subject to the programs are subtracted from the target production.
    3. Post-initial implementation phase review. Except as provided in subsection 23.58B.010.B.4, the Council intends that, after the completion of the initial implementation phase described in subsection 23.58B.010.A.2, amendments to the payment and performance amounts in Tables A and B for 23.58B.040 and Tables A and B for 23.58B.050 shall be consistent with the following provisions:

        1. Amendments may be considered if:

            1. After five years from the effective date of the ordinance introduced as Council Bill 118498, there is a failure to meet expectations for program performance;
            2. There are significant positive or negative changes in real estate development market conditions; or
            3. Neither of the preceding criteria is met and ten years have elapsed since the completion of the initial implementation phase described in subsection 23.58B.010.A.2.
        2. If amendments are considered in accordance with a criterion in subsection 23.58B.010.B.3.a, the Mayor and Council shall appoint a Technical Review Committee whose membership includes appropriate stakeholder representation, including representatives of the for-profit and non-profit development sectors and members of community-based groups, and shall provide the Committee with clear objectives to be accomplished by a revision of the payment and performance amounts in this Chapter 23.58B.
        3. If appointed, the Technical Review Committee shall prepare a report and recommendation regarding amendments to the payment and performance amounts in Table A for 23.58B.040, Table B for 23.58B.040, Table A for 23.58B.050, and Table B for 23.58B.050. The Mayor shall consider the Technical Review Committee's report and recommendations and shall transmit them to the Council along with any recommendation by the Mayor for amendments.
    4. Amendments concurrent with increased capacity. In conjunction with any increase in commercial development capacity other than those identified in subsection 23.58B.010.A.2, the Council will apply Chapter 23.58B to the zones or areas in which capacity is increased and may amend Table A for 23.58B.040, Table B for 23.58B.040, Table A for 23.58B.050, and Table B for 23.58B.050 for those zones or areas in which capacity is increased.
3. Process for modifications of development standards

    1. The Council intends that, at the time reference to this Chapter 23.58B is made in the provisions of a zone consistent with subsection 23.58B.010.A.1, Land Use Code changes will be adopted providing a process by which the Director would be authorized to modify certain dimensional development standards to ensure that, in most cases, utilization of the increased commercial development capacity is not prohibited by development standards.
    2. To enable development of such Land Use Code changes, the Director shall report on which development standards, if any, might be appropriate for modification in particular zones and the extent to which modifications might be allowed from particular standards.
    3. The Council intends that any development standard modification process will also provide for a reduction of the payment and/or performance amounts in a limited number of cases where a portion of the increased development capacity cannot be used because of a development standard from which a modification is not available or is not granted, and not because of decisions of the applicant.

#### 23.58B.015 - Scope of Chapter

This Chapter 23.58B contains provisions that apply only in areas for which the provisions of the zone specifically refer to this Chapter 23.58B, or through the terms of a contract rezone in accordance with Section 23.34.004.

The Director may modify the amount of mitigation required in accordance with Section 23.58B.040 or Section 23.58B.050 if the amount of mitigation, after any modification to which the applicant would be entitled in accordance with the standards of subsection 23.58B.030.B and subsection 23.58B.030.C, would cause a severe and unexpected financial hardship that outweighs the affordable housing impacts.
    2. The request for a modification authorized by subsection 23.58B.030.D.1 shall include, at a minimum, all of the following:

        1. The use of the site before the request;
        2. How application of the requirements for which the modification is being requested restricts the proposed use of the site compared to the restrictions that existed prior to the adoption of this Chapter 23.58B;
        3. The possible remaining uses of the site if the modification were not granted;
        4. The uses of the site that would have been allowed prior to the adoption of this Chapter 23.58B;
        5. An appraisal prepared by a competent appraiser with a valuation date within thirty days of the modification request that (1) values the property taking into account the requirements of this Chapter 23.58B as well as any increase in commercial development capacity provided at the time reference to this Chapter 23.58B is made in the provisions of the zone in which the property is located or at the time of a contract rezone, and (2) values the property absent those requirements and absent any such increase in development capacity; and
        6. The feasibility of altering the project to apply the requirements of this Chapter 23.58B.
    3. The Director may grant a modification authorized by subsection 23.58B.030.D.1 only after considering the following factors:

        1. The severity of the financial hardship caused by the mitigation and the degree to which the mitigation requirement could have been anticipated;
        2. The extent to which alternative designs and uses of the property would remedy any severe and unexpected financial hardship associated with the required mitigation; and
        3. The extent to which the qualities of the particular property, its zoning, and other factors are such that the required mitigation creates a unique burden that imposes a severe impact on the ability to utilize the property.
    4. The Director may grant a modification authorized by subsection 23.58B.030.D.1 only to the extent necessary to provide relief from the identified financial hardship.
    5.

Except as specifically provided otherwise, the regulations of this Chapter 23.60A do not apply to the operation of boats, ships and other vessels designed and used for navigation, other than moorage of vessels and uses on vessels unrelated to navigation; nor to the vacation and closure, removal or demolition of buildings determined by the Director to be unfit for human habitation pursuant to the Seattle Housing Code; nor to correction of conditions found by the Director to be in violation of the minimum standards of Chapters 22.200, et seq., of the Seattle Housing Code; nor to the demolition of a structure pursuant to an ordinance declaring it to be a public nuisance and providing for summary abatement; nor to actions taken pursuant to environmental excellence program agreements entered into under RCW 43.21K.


##### 23.60A.020 - Permits and exemptions

1. Shoreline substantial development permit required

    1. A shoreline substantial development permit is required prior to undertaking any development unless the Director determines the development is not substantial development or has issued an exemption under this Section 23.60A.020. Development does not include demolition, except when the Director determines that such demolition will have a major impact upon the character of the shoreline.
    2. Criterion for requiring a shoreline substantial development permit

        1. "Substantial development" means any development for which the total cost or fair market value exceeds $6,416, as adjusted under RCW 90.58.030(3)(e), or any development that materially interferes with the normal public use of the water or shorelines of the City. The dollar threshold will be recalculated and published in the Washington State Register every five years with the next recalculation to occur in 2017.
        2. A development, shoreline modification, or use that does not meet the definition of substantial development or that has received an exemption from the shoreline substantial development permit process shall comply with the Shoreline Management Act, the provisions of this Chapter 23.60A, and any other regulatory requirements.
    3. A development, shoreline modification, or use that is listed as a shoreline conditional use in this Chapter 23.60A or that is not identified in the shoreline environment where it is proposed to be located and is allowed in the underlying zone and special district requires a shoreline conditional use permit under this Chapter 23.60A, even if the development, shoreline modification, or use does not otherwise require a shoreline substantial development permit.
    4. A development or shoreline modification that does not comply with the bulk, dimensional or performance standards of this Chapter 23.60A may only be authorized by a variance under this Chapter 23.60A, even if the development or shoreline modification does not otherwise require a shoreline substantial development permit.
    5. Repair and maintenance of an existing development, shoreline modification, or use that was authorized by a special use, shoreline conditional use, or shoreline variance does not require approval of a special use permit, shoreline conditional use permit, or shoreline variance, if no expansion occurs; if expansion would occur, the permit process is the process applicable to the type of development, use, or shoreline modification as if it were a new application under the Shoreline Master Program in effect when the application for such repair and maintenance is made.
2. Application and interpretation of exemptions

    1. The applicant has the burden of proof that an action is not development, that a development is not substantial development, and that a substantial development is exempt from the shoreline substantial development permit process.
    2. Exemption interpretation

        1. Exemptions shall be construed narrowly.
        2. Substantial developments that meet the precise terms of one or more of the listed exemptions may be granted an exemption from the shoreline substantial development permit process.
        3. If any part of a proposed substantial development is not eligible for exemption, then a shoreline substantial development permit is required for the entire proposed development project.
    3. The Director may attach conditions to the approval of exempted developments as necessary to assure consistency of the project with the Shoreline Management Act and this Chapter 23.60A.
3. Exemptions. The following substantial developments are exempt from obtaining a shoreline substantial development permit from the Director:

    1. "Normal maintenance" or repair of existing structures or developments, including damage by accident, fire or elements.

        1. "Normal maintenance" means those usual acts to prevent a decline, lapse or cessation from a lawfully established state comparable to its original condition, including but not limited to its size, shape, configuration, location, and external appearance, within a reasonable period after decay or partial destruction, except where repair causes substantial adverse effects to shoreline resources or environment.
        2. Replacement of a structure or development is repair if such replacement is the common method of repair for the type of structure or development and the replacement structure or development is comparable to the original structure or development including but not limited to its size, shape, configuration, location and external appearance, and the replacement does not cause substantial adverse effects to shoreline resources or environment.
    2. Construction of a "normal protective bulkhead" common to single-family residences. A "normal protective bulkhead" means those structural and nonstructural developments installed at or near, and parallel to, the OHW mark for the sole purpose of protecting an existing single-family residence and appurtenant structures from loss or damage by erosion. Construction of a normal protective bulkhead or repair is exempt if:

        1. It is not constructed for the purpose of creating dry land;
        2. A vertical wall is being constructed or reconstructed, and not more than 1 cubic yard of fill per 1 foot of wall may be used as backfill;
        3. An existing bulkhead is being repaired by construction of a vertical wall fronting the existing wall, and it is constructed no further waterward of the existing bulkhead than is necessary for construction of new footings;
        4. A bulkhead has deteriorated such that an ordinary high water (OHW) mark has been established by the presence and action of water landward of the bulkhead, and the replacement bulkhead is located at or near the actual OHW mark; and
        5. Beach nourishment, or non-structural or soft stabilization is proposed; such projects may be considered a normal protective bulkhead if all structural elements are consistent with the requirements of this subsection 23.60A.020.C.2 and if the project has been approved by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW).
    3. Emergencies

        1. Emergency construction necessary to protect property from damage by the elements if:

            1. It does not include creation of new permanent protective structures where none previously existed; or
            2. If new protective structures are deemed by the Director to be the appropriate means to address the emergency situation, upon abatement of the emergency situation the new structure shall be removed or any permit that would have been required, absent an emergency, pursuant to RCW 90.58 or these regulations shall be obtained; and
            3. Flooding or other seasonal events that can be anticipated and may occur but that are not imminent are not an emergency.
        2. Upon abatement of the emergency situation the new structure shall be removed or any permit, which would have been required, absent an emergency, pursuant to RCW 90.58 or these regulations, shall be obtained. All emergency construction shall be consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58 and the Seattle Shoreline Master Program. As a general matter, flooding or other seasonal events that can be anticipated and may occur but that are not imminent are not an emergency.
    4. Construction and practices normal or necessary for farming, irrigation, and ranching activities, including agricultural service roads and utilities on shorelands, construction of a barn or similar structure, and the construction and maintenance of irrigation structures, including but not limited to head gates, pumping facilities, and irrigation channels; provided, that a feedlot of any size, all processing plants, other activities of a commercial nature, alteration of the contour of the shorelands by leveling or filling other than that which results from normal cultivation, are not considered normal or necessary farming or ranching activities.
    5. Construction or modification, by or under the authority of the Coast Guard or a designated port management authority, of navigational aids, such as channel markers and anchor buoys.
    6. Construction on shorelands by an owner, lessee or contract purchaser of a single-family residence, for his or her own use or for the use of his or her family, that does not exceed a height of 35 feet above average grade level and meets all requirements of the City. Construction authorized under this exemption shall be located landward of the OHW mark. For the purpose of this exemption:

        1. Single family residence means a detached dwelling designed for and occupied by one family, including those structures and developments within a contiguous ownership that are a normal appurtenance.
        2. A normal appurtenance is necessarily connected to the use and enjoyment of a single-family residence and is located landward of the OHW mark and the perimeter of a wetland. Normal appurtenances include, but are not limited to, a garage, deck, driveway, utilities, fences, installation of a septic tank and drainfield, and grading that does not exceed 250 cubic yards and that does not involve placement of fill in any wetland, riparian watercourse or waterward of the OHW mark.
    7. Construction of a pier accessory to residential structures, including a community pier, designed for pleasure craft only for the private noncommercial use of the owners, lessee or contract purchaser of a single-family or multifamily residence. For the purpose of this exemption a pier is a landing and moorage facility for watercraft and does not include recreational decks, storage facilities or other appurtenances. This exception applies if either:

        1. In saltwater, which includes Puget Sound, Elliott Bay, Shilshole Bay, the Harborfront and the Duwamish River and all associated bays and inlets, the fair market value of the pier accessory to residential structures does not exceed $2,500; or
        2. In freshwater, the fair market value of the pier accessory to residential structures does not exceed $10,000; but if subsequent construction having a fair market value exceeding $2,500 occurs within five years of completion of the prior construction, the subsequent construction shall be considered a substantial development for the purpose of this Chapter 23.60A.

    2. In developing the Director's Rule, the Director shall consult with relevant state and federal regulatory agencies and include affected stakeholders.
2. The procedures shall:

    1. Use appropriate scientific and technical information to determine, measure and/or quantify ecological functions required to determine no net loss of ecological function; including relative proximity to the ordinary high water mark; and
    2. Determine the costs of restoration and enhancement actions of habitat units, using full cost accounting principles, including consideration of the following: project design, permitting, construction, monitoring, maintenance, adaptive management, long term stewardship (indexed to the rate of inflation), and land value; and
    3. Not conflict with the federal and state standards for mitigating related environmental impacts.
3. At least 30 days prior to the Department adopting the Director's Rule, the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall present the rule to the City Council for review and comment.
4. If ecological restoration is required as a development standard, the Director may authorize providing such ecological restoration through the equivalent number of habitat units, if habitat units have been developed for the location. In the UI and UM Environments for water-dependent and water-related businesses, the Director by rule may establish alternative sustainable development requirements for the replacement of a structure located in required shoreline setback. This alternative sustainable development shall provide a net environmental benefit to the shoreline environment.

##### 23.60A.028 - Payment for habitat units

4. Exception: In the case of any permit or decision to issue a permit to the state of Washington Department of Transportation for the replacement of the floating bridge and landings of the state route number 520 Evergreen Point bridge on or adjacent to Lake Washington, construction may begin as provided in RCW 90.58.140(5). Any applicant who wishes to begin construction pursuant to this Section 23.60A.072 prior to termination of all review proceedings does so at the applicant's own risk.

##### 23.60A.074 - Effective date of shoreline substantial development permits and time limits for permit validity

The following time requirements apply to all shoreline substantial development permits and to any development authorized pursuant to a shoreline variance or shoreline conditional use permit authorized under this Chapter 23.60A:


1. Upon finding of good cause, based on the requirements and circumstances of the development, shoreline modification, or use ("project") proposed and consistent with the policy and provisions of WAC 173-27 and this Chapter 23.60A, the Director may adopt different time limits from those in subsection 23.60A.074.B as part of the decision on a shoreline substantial development permit. The Director may also, with approval from Ecology, adopt appropriate time limits as part of the decision on a shoreline conditional use or shoreline variance. "Good cause, based on the requirements and circumstances of the project," means that the time limits established are reasonably related to the time actually necessary to perform the project on the ground and complete the project that is being permitted, and/or are necessary for the protection of shoreline resources.
2. If the Director did not adopt different time limits on a permit decision, the following time limits shall apply:

    1. Construction activities or substantial progress toward construction of a project or, if no construction activities are involved, the project for which a permit has been granted pursuant to this Chapter 23.60A shall be commenced within two years of the effective date of a shoreline substantial development permit or the permit shall terminate. The Director may authorize a single extension of the two year period not to exceed one year based on reasonable factors, if a request for extension has been filed before the expiration date and notice of the proposed extension is given to parties of record on the shoreline substantial development permit and to Ecology;
    2. If a project for which a permit has been granted pursuant to this Chapter 23.60A has not been completed within five years after the effective date of the shoreline substantial development permit, authorization to conduct construction activities shall expire unless the Director authorizes a single extension based on reasonable factors, for a period not to exceed one year, if a request for extension has been filed before the expiration date and notice of the proposed extension is given to parties of record on the shoreline substantial development permit and to Ecology;
    3. The effective date of a shoreline substantial development permit is the date of receipt as provided in RCW 90.58.140(6). The time periods in subsections 23.60A.074.A and 23.60A.074.B do not include the time during which a project, use or activity was not pursued due to the pendency of administrative appeals or legal actions or due to the need to obtain other government permits and approvals for the project, use or activity, including all reasonably related administrative or legal actions on any such permits or approval; and
    4. A Plan Shoreline Permit issued pursuant to Section 23.60A.066 is valid for a period of five years or as otherwise allowed by WAC 173-27-090. Project-specific shoreline permits must be applied for within that period to be considered pursuant to the determination made under the Plan Shoreline Permit. Development under project-specific permits shall conform to the time limits outlined in subsections 23.60A.074.A and 23.60A.074.B.

##### 23.60A.076 - Revisions to permits

1. If an applicant seeks to revise a permit, the applicant shall submit detailed plans and text describing the proposed changes.
2. If the Director determines that the proposed changes are within the scope and intent of the original permit as defined in WAC 173-27-100(2), the Director shall approve the revision with conditions to address any new impacts from the proposed changes. Within eight days of the date of approval, the approved revision, along with copies of the revised site plan and text, shall be transmitted to Ecology, the Attorney General, and copies provided to parties of record and to persons who have previously notified the Director of their desire to receive notice of decision on the original application.
3. Revisions to permits may be authorized after original permit authorization has expired under RCW 90.58.143. The purpose of such revisions shall be limited to authorization of changes that are consistent with this Section 23.60A.076 and that would not require a permit for the development or change proposed under the terms of RCW 90.58, WAC 173-27 and this Chapter 23.60A. If the proposed change constitutes substantial development then a new permit is required. Provided, this Section 23.60A.076 shall not be used to extend the time requirements or to authorize substantial development beyond the time limits of the original permit.
4. If the sum of the revision and any previously approved revisions under former WAC 173-14-064 or this Section 23.60A.076 are not within the scope of the permit under subsection 23.60A.076.B, the applicant shall apply for a new permit.
5. If the Director determines that the proposed changes are not within the scope and intent of the original permit, the applicant shall apply for a new permit in the manner provided for in this Chapter 23.60A.
6. If the revision to the original permit involves a shoreline conditional use or shoreline variance, the Director shall submit the revision to Ecology for Ecology's approval, approval with conditions or denial, indicating that the revision is being submitted pursuant to WAC 173-27-100(6). Ecology shall render and transmit to the City and the applicant Ecology's final decision within 15 days of the date of Ecology's receipt of the submittal by the Director, who shall notify parties of record of Ecology's final decision.
7. The revised permit is effective immediately upon final action by the Director, or if appropriate under WAC 173-27-100(6), by Ecology.
8. Appeals shall be in accordance with RCW 90.58.180 and shall be filed with the State Shoreline Hearings Board within 21 days from date of Ecology's receipt of the revision approved by the Director, or if the revision is to a shoreline conditional use or variance, from the date Ecology's final decision is transmitted to the City and the applicant. Appeals shall be based solely upon contentions of noncompliance with the provisions of WAC 173-27-100(2). Construction undertaken pursuant to that portion of a revised permit not authorized under the original permit is at the applicant's own risk until the expiration of the appeals deadline. If an appeal is successful in proving that a revision is not within the scope and intent of the original permit, the decision shall have no bearing on the original permit. The party seeking review has the burden of proving the revision was not within the scope and intent of the original permit.

##### 23.60A.078 - Rescission

1. The Director may rescind or suspend a shoreline substantial development permit if any of the following occur:

    1. The permittee has developed the site in a manner not authorized by the permit;
    2. The permittee has not complied with the conditions of the permit;
    3. The permittee has secured the permit with false or misleading information; or
    4. The permit was issued in error.
2. The determination that a permit should be rescinded or suspended shall be made following a public hearing by the Director. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed to the permittee not fewer than 15 days prior to the date set for the hearing and be included in the Land Use Information Bulletin. The notice shall specify the basis for the hearing.

##### 23.60A.082 - Enforcement

Procedures for investigation and notice of violation, compliance, stop work orders, emergency orders, and the imposition of civil penalties for the violation of any requirements of this Chapter 23.60A shall be as specified in Chapter 23.90, Enforcement of the Land Use Code, and in Chapter 23.91, Citations-Hearings-Penalties, except as provided otherwise in this Chapter 23.60A.



#### Subchapter III: - General Provisions

#### Part 1 - Use Standards
##### 23.60A.090 - Identification of principal and accessory uses

1. In all shoreline environments all uses on waterfront lots are prohibited over water as a principal or accessory use unless the use is allowed or allowed as a special use, a shoreline conditional use, or a Council conditional use in the shoreline environment where the use is proposed and the use is:

    1. Boat moorage, off-loading goods from boats, dry docks, swimming platforms, uses on vessels authorized under Sections 23.60A.214 and 23.60A.215, or other use components that by their nature require an over water location to operate;
    2. Railroad, rail transit, streets, bridges, and tunnels that reasonably need to cross water that is regulated in this Chapter 23.60A;
    3. Floating home moorages, floating homes, house barges, and floating on-water residences authorized under Section 23.60A.202, 23.60A.204, and 23.60A.203; or
    4. Allowed, allowed as a special use, allowed as a shoreline conditional use, or allowed as a Council conditional use as a use over water in the specific regulations for the type of use or for the shoreline environment.
2. Any principal use allowed, allowed as a special use, allowed as a shoreline conditional use, or allowed as a Council conditional use in a specific shoreline environment may be an accessory use using the same process as if the use were the principal use, unless the use is prohibited as an accessory use in the shoreline environment. For the purposes of this subsection 23.60A.090.B, water-based airports, heliports, and helistops shall not be considered to be accessory to a principal use and are allowed pursuant to the applicable shoreline environment.
3. A use that is prohibited as a principal use in a particular shoreline environment may be allowed as an accessory use on dry land if incidental to and necessary for the operation of a principal use that is allowed, allowed as a special use, allowed as a shoreline conditional use, or allowed as a Council conditional use in the specific shoreline environment, using the same process as the principal use, unless the use is prohibited as an accessory use in the shoreline environment. For purposes of this subsection 23.60A.090.C, water-based airports, heliports, and helistops shall not be considered to be accessory to a principal use and are allowed pursuant to the applicable shoreline environment.
4. Standards for accessory uses

    1. Accessory uses shall be located on the same development site as the principal use, except as provided in subsection 23.60A.090.D.2.
    2. Accessory uses may be located off site if:

        1. The accessory use is allowed as a principal use in the shoreline environment applicable to an adjacent development site, the accessory use may be located on that adjacent development site; or
        2. The accessory use is parking and the parking is proposed to be located within 800 feet of the development site where the principal use is located; and

            1. The parking is located in a new or existing parking structure or at an existing surface parking area; and
            2. Additional and enhanced public access is provided commensurate with the area of parking that would have otherwise occurred on the site;
            3. Ecological restoration and enhancement in the form of a decrease in the amount of impervious surface and an increase in the amount of native vegetation is provided commensurate with the area of parking that would have otherwise occurred on the site; and
            4. Existing surface parking is removed within the Shoreline District or the area of new or existing parking is reduced in the Shoreline District.


#### Part 2 - Nonconforming Uses and Structures
##### 23.60A.122 - Nonconforming uses

1. Nonconforming uses

    1. A nonconforming use may be continued subject to the provisions of this Section 23.60A.122.
    2. A nonconforming use that has been discontinued for more than 12 consecutive months in the CN, CP, CR, CM, CW, UR, UH and UC Environments or more than 24 consecutive months in the UM, UG or UI Environments shall not be reestablished or recommenced. A use is considered discontinued if:

        1. A permit to change the use of the structure or property has been issued and acted upon; or
        2. The structure or property or portion of a structure or property is either vacant or is not being used for the use allowed by the most recent permit for the length of time provided in subsection 23.60A.122.A.2.
    3. The use of the structure is considered discontinued even if materials from the former use remain or are stored on the property. A multifamily structure with one or more vacant dwelling units is not considered unused unless the total structure is unoccupied.
    4. Existing uses in the UC, UG, UH, UI, UM, or UR Environments that are within the required shoreline setback and are not otherwise nonconforming to use regulations are regulated by the standards of the applicable environment and not by this Section 23.60A.122.
2. Nonconforming use in a conforming structure or development

    1. A conforming structure or development containing a nonconforming use or uses may be maintained, repaired, or structurally altered but shall not be expanded or extended beyond its existing external dimensions for the purposes of the nonconforming use, except as provided in subsections 23.60A.122.C and 23.60A.122.E, or as otherwise required by law, if necessary to improve access for the elderly or disabled, or to provide regulated public access.
    2. A conforming structure or development containing a nonconforming use or uses may not be rebuilt or substantially improved for the purposes of the nonconforming use, except as provided in subsections 23.60A.122.C.1, 23.60A.122.C.2 and 23.60A.122.E.
3. Conforming structure containing a nonconforming use

    1. A conforming structure containing a nonconforming use may be rebuilt or substantially improved if the applicant demonstrates that the structure is reasonably capable of containing a conforming use without modifying the rebuilt or improved structure, except as provided in subsection 23.60A.122.E. A structure that is allowed to be rebuilt or substantially improved shall not be expanded or extended beyond its existing external dimensions for the purposes of the nonconforming use.
    2. A conforming structure or development containing a nonconforming use that is destroyed by fire, act of nature, or other causes beyond the control of the owner, excluding normal deterioration of structures constructed in or over the water, may be rebuilt or substantially improved if:

        1. Action toward replacement is commenced within 12 months after destruction in the CN, CP, CR, CM, CW, UR, UH and UC Environments or within 24 months in the UM, UG, or UI Environments; and
        2. The structure or portion of the structure occupied by the nonconforming use is improved or rebuilt to the same or smaller configuration, existing immediately prior to the time the structure was destroyed unless one of the provisions in subsection 23.60A.122.C.2.c apply.
        3. Configuration alternatives

            1. Reconfiguration of the structure occupied by the nonconforming use is allowed if reconfiguration results in reduced impacts on ecological functions as compared to the configuration immediately prior to the time the structure was destroyed;
            2. A substantially improved or rebuilt structure housing a nonconforming eating and drinking establishment use in the UC Environment may consolidate other existing nonconforming uses on the property, if no cumulative expansion or intensification of the nonconforming use and no increase in over-water coverage occurs and the Director finds that the reconfiguration will allow removal of structures housing other nonconforming uses, resulting in improved ecological functions, view corridors or regulated public access; or
            3. The structure is nonconforming moorage that is reconfigured consistent with subsection 23.60A.122.E.
4. Change of one nonconforming use for another nonconforming use

    1. The change of one nonconforming use to another use not allowed in the shoreline environment may be authorized as a shoreline conditional use by the Director, with the concurrence of Ecology, if the area occupied by the nonconforming use does not expand and the Director determines that:

        1. The existing development is unsuited for a reasonably economically viable use allowed in the environment; and
        2. The new use is no more detrimental to ecological functions and to property in the vicinity than the existing use;
        3. For uses located in structures located over water:

            1. First, no reasonable economic alternative exists for locating the use on the dry land portion of the lot and outside the setback to the maximum extent reasonable; and
            2. Second, no reasonable economic alternative exists for locating the use on the dry land portion of the lot to the maximum extent reasonable; and
        4. For uses in structures located within the required shoreline setback no reasonable alternative exists for locating the use wholly outside of the setback; if the use cannot be located wholly outside the setback it shall be located outside the setback to the maximum extent reasonable.
    2. If the Director determines that a nonconforming use in a structure over water and/or within the required setback may be changed, the Director shall require the applicant to provide an area of ecological restoration equivalent to the gross floor area of the use that is nonconforming.
    3. The new use shall retain its nonconforming use status for the purposes of subsections 23.60A.122.A through 23.60A.122.D; and
    4. This subsection 23.60A.122.D does not apply to uses on vessels.
5. Reconfiguration of a nonconforming moorage use.

    1. Reconfiguration of a nonconforming moorage use may be authorized as a shoreline conditional use, except as provided in subsection 23.60A.122.E.2, if the Director determines that:

        1. The goals of this Chapter 23.60A, including limiting location of structures over water, would be better served;
        2. View corridors and public access that do not meet development standards are improved to the maximum extent reasonable;
        3. Total over water coverage, including potential coverage by vessels or floating structures that are moored, is not increased; and
        4. If the moorage includes covered moorage:

            1. The height of the covered moorage is not increased; and
            2. Walls are prohibited, unless in conflict with the Seattle Fire Code.
    2. Reconfiguration of an existing nonconforming moorage use may be authorized without obtaining a shoreline conditional use permit if the conditions in subsection 23.60A.122.E.1 are met and the total area of over water coverage, including potential coverage by vessels or floating structures that are moored, and including any existing covered moorage, is reduced by 20 percent. When calculating the reduction in over water coverage, grated decking and translucent roofing material shall not be included.

##### 23.60A.124 - Development nonconforming to development standards

1. Development that was lawful when constructed and that does not conform to applicable development standards in this Chapter 23.60A is regulated as development nonconforming to development standards. Development that did not comply with the development standards in effect when the development was constructed is unlawful and is not regulated as development nonconforming to development standards.
2. Maintenance, repair, structural alteration, substantial improvement and replacement of development nonconforming to development standards shall conform to the development standards in Subchapter III, including Sections 23.60A.152 and 23.60A.158, and the standards for the shoreline environment in which the structure or development is located, in addition to the standards of this Section 23.60A.124. Development in the UC, UG, UH, UI, UM, or UR Environments that is within the required shoreline setback and is not otherwise nonconforming to development standards is regulated by the standards of the applicable environment and not by this Section 23.60A.124.
3. On dry land and outside the shoreline setback and shoreline residential setback a development nonconforming to development standards may be maintained, repaired, structurally altered, substantially improved or replaced but is prohibited from expanding or extending in any manner that increases the extent of nonconformity or creates additional nonconformity, except as allowed in subsection 23.60A.124.G or except as otherwise required by law if necessary to improve access for the elderly or disabled or to provide regulated public access.
4. Development located over water or in setbacks

    1. Except as provided in subsection 23.60A.124.D.2, a development nonconforming to development standards because of its location over water, within the required shoreline setback, or within the residential shoreline setback may be maintained, repaired and structurally altered consistent with subsections 23.60A.124.F and 23.60A.124.G but is prohibited from being:

        1. Substantially improved except as provided in subsection 23.60A.124.I;
        2. Replaced, except as provided in subsection 23.60A.124.I; or
        3. Expanded in any manner that increases the extent of nonconformity or creates additional nonconformity, except as provided in subsections 23.60A.124.F and 23.60A.124.I, and as otherwise required by law, if necessary to improve access for the elderly or disabled, or to provide regulated public access.
    2. The provisions of subsection 23.60A.124.D.1 do not apply to development in the UC, UG, UH, UI, UM, or UR Environments that is within the required shoreline setback and conforms to development regulations for locating over water and for residential shoreline setback. Such development is regulated by the standards of the applicable environment for development within the shoreline setback and by all other provisions of this Section 23.60A.124 with respect to any other nonconformity.
5. If the development is nonconforming as to lot coverage, existing lot coverage may not be transferred from the dry land portion of the site to the water or from outside the shoreline setback to within the shoreline setback.
6. Reconfiguration of a conforming moorage use nonconforming to development standards. Reconfiguration of a conforming moorage use that is nonconforming to development standards may be authorized as follows:

    1. The reconfiguration is not a substantial improvement or replacement;
    2. The reconfigured moorage results in an increase in ecological function; and
    3. If the moorage does not meet view corridor development standards, the view corridor is improved.
7. Reconfiguration. Portions of existing principal structures on dry land may be reconfigured as part of allowed work on development nonconforming to development standards if the Director determines that:

    1. The reconfiguration results in equal or greater protection of ecological functions;
    2. Views from neighboring waterfront residences are not affected;
    3. Required view corridors and street views are not further blocked; and
    4. The reconfiguration results in equal or improved public access, if required.
8. For alteration of a development nonconforming as to public access requirements, the Director may require compliance with Section 23.60A.164, Standards for regulated public access, as a condition of a shoreline substantial development permit.
9. Development not conforming to development standards that is destroyed by fire, act of nature, or other causes beyond the control of the owner, excluding normal deterioration of structures constructed in or over the water, may be rebuilt if the standards in subsections 1 through 3 of this subsection 23.60A.124.I are met:

    1. Reconfiguration. The development meets one of the following standards:

        1. The development is rebuilt to the same or smaller configuration existing immediately prior to the time the structure was destroyed;
        2. Reconfiguration of the structure is allowed if reconfiguration results in reduced impacts on ecological functions as compared to the configuration immediately prior to the time the structure was destroyed;
        3. The rebuilt development contains a nonconforming eating and drinking establishment use in the UC Environment and consolidates with other existing nonconforming development on the lot and:

            1. No increase in height or cumulative expansion of the area of nonconforming development and no increase in over water coverage occurs; and
            2. The Director finds that the reconfiguration will allow removal of other nonconforming development that results in improved ecological functions, view corridors or regulated public access; or
        4. The development is nonconforming moorage that is reconfigured consistent with subsection 23.60A.122.E.
    2. If the development is over water, within the required setback, or within the residential shoreline setback, it may be rebuilt in the following locations:

        1. If the dry land portion of the lot from the OHW mark to the street is at least 65 feet, the replacement development shall be landward of the shoreline setback;
        2. If the dry land portion of the lot from the OHW mark to the street is less than 65 feet but more than 35 feet, the replacement development shall be no further waterward from the street than 35 feet and shall be located outside of the shoreline setback to the extent reasonable; and
        3. If the dry land portion of the lot from the OHW mark to the street is 35 feet or less, the replacement development may be rebuilt within the shoreline setback to the existing footprint of the structure or overwater to the existing footprint of the structure.
    3. Action toward replacement is commenced within 12 months after destruction in the CN, CP, CR, CM, CW, UR, UH and UC Environments or within 24 months in the UM, UG, or UI Environments.
10. If development nonconforming to development standards is substantially improved, replaced or rebuilt under subsections C or I of Section 23.60A.124, and the Director finds that permanently removing the nonconformity would have improved ecological function, the applicant shall provide ecological restoration equivalent to such improvement to ecological function, unless the applicant demonstrates that the cost of such restoration will preclude construction based on economic hardship. If the applicant makes such a showing, the Director shall reduce the requirement to the extent necessary to provide relief.

##### 23.60A.126 - Structures in trespass

Sections 23.60A.122 through 23.60A.124, provisions for nonconforming uses and structures, do not apply to any structure, improvement, dock, fill, or development placed in trespass or in violation of state statutes on tidelands, shorelands, or beds of waters.



#### Part 3 - Development Standards
##### 23.60A.150 - Applicable standards

##### 23.60A.152 - General development

All developments, shoreline modifications, including land disturbing activity, and uses are subject to the following general development standards, whether they are located on dry land, overwater or in setbacks:


1. All shoreline developments, shoreline modifications, and uses shall be located, designed, constructed and managed to achieve no net loss of ecological functions. No net loss of ecological functions shall be achieved by applying the standards set out in this Chapter 23.60A, including applying mitigation sequencing pursuant to Section 23.60A.158.
2. All shoreline development, shoreline modifications, and uses shall be located, designed, constructed, and managed to avoid, or if that is infeasible, to minimize to the maximum extent feasible, adverse impacts or interference with beneficial natural shoreline processes such as water circulation, littoral drift, sand movement, or erosion.
3. All shoreline developments, shoreline modifications, and uses shall be located, designed, constructed, and managed to prevent the need for shoreline defense and stabilization measures and flood protection works such as bulkheads, other bank stabilization, fills, levees, dikes, groins, jetties, dredging, or substantial site regrades to the extent feasible except as allowed in Section 23.60A.188.
4. All new shoreline development and uses shall be sited and designed to avoid or, if that is infeasible, to minimize to the maximum extent feasible the need for new and maintenance dredging.
5. All shoreline developments, shoreline modifications, and uses shall be located, designed, constructed, and managed in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts to surrounding land and water uses in the Shoreline District and is compatible with the affected area in the Shoreline District.
6. All shoreline developments, shoreline modifications, and uses shall be located, constructed, operated, and managed to protect public health and safety.
7. Disturbance areas and land clearing shall be limited to the minimum necessary for development. Any surface disturbed or cleared of vegetation and not to be used for development shall be planted with native vegetation, except that pre-disturbance landscaped areas containing non-native vegetation located outside the shoreline setback may be re-landscaped using non-native, noninvasive vegetation pursuant to Section 23.60A.190.
8. All shoreline developments, shoreline modifications, and uses shall use best management practices pursuant to DR 16-2009, Construction Stormwater Control Technical Requirements, to control impacts during construction.
9. All shoreline developments, shoreline modifications, and uses shall be located, designed, constructed, operated and managed to: protect the quality and quantity of surface and ground water on and adjacent to the development lot by using best management practices as follows:

    1. Keep all material on the property appropriately stored, and maintain all structures, machinery, and materials on the property to prevent the entry of debris and waste materials into any water body.
    2. Pave and/or berm drum storage areas, and control fugitive dust to prevent contamination of land or water.
    3. Minimize the impervious surface on the site, and use permeable surfacing where practicable, except where other required state or federal permits prohibit such actions.
    4. Use other control measures as appropriate, including but not limited to bioretention, rainwater harvesting, downspout dispersion, filters, catch basins, and planted buffers.
10. All in-water and over-water structures shall be designed, located, constructed, and managed to avoid adverse impacts to aquatic habitat, such as increased salmonid predator habitat and adverse impacts due to shading, to the maximum extent feasible and to limit construction to the times of the year when construction will have the least impact on migrating salmonids as set by WDFW and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
11. Durable, non-toxic components are the first priority for in-water and over-water structures and shall be used unless it is unreasonable. Treated wood and other material shall be the least toxic according to industry standards. Treated wood used shall be applied and used in accordance with the American Wood Preserver Association (AWPA) standards for aquatic use. Wood treated with pentachlorophenol, creosote, chromate copper arsenate (CCA), or comparably toxic compounds is prohibited for decking or piling.
12. Creosote piles

    1. Creosote treated piles may be repaired if:

        1. the piling is under a structure that is not being replaced; or
        2. fewer than 50 percent of the existing piles are in need of repair under a structure that is being replaced.
    2. "Sleeving" shall be the repair method used unless another method provides better protection of ecological functions.
    3. Creosote treated piles in need of repair must be replaced if under a structure that is being replaced and 50 percent or more of the number of piles are proposed to be repaired, if reasonable.
13. Replaced covered moorage and new and replaced boat sheds shall be designed to provide the maximum ambient light to reach the water. Designs shall:

    1. Minimize sides of the structures; and
    2. Provide light transmitting roofing and side material to the maximum extent feasible.
14. Light transmitting features are required to be installed for all new and replaced piers and floats, over-water boat repair facilities and similar structures to the maximum extent feasible. When determining feasibility of light transmitting features for nonresidential piers and floats see subsection 23.60A.187.E.6.
15. Tires are prohibited as part of above or below water structures or where tires could potentially come in contact with the water (e.g., floatation, fenders, hinges). During maintenance of structures using tires, existing tires shall be removed or replaced with nontoxic material.
16. All foam material, whether used for floatation or for any other purpose, shall be encapsulated within a shell that prevents breakup or loss of the foam material into the water and that is not readily subject to damage by ultraviolet radiation or abrasion. During maintenance of structures using foam, existing un-encapsulated foam material shall be removed or replaced with material meeting the standards of this subsection 23.60A.152.P.
17. Artificial night lighting shall first be avoided. If that is infeasible, lighting should minimize night light impacts on the aquatic environment by focusing the light on the pier surface, using shades that minimize illumination of the surrounding environment and using lights that minimize penetration into the water, to the maximum extent feasible, considering the activities that occur at the site at night.
18. The release of oil, chemicals, solid waste, untreated effluents, or other hazardous materials onto or into the water is prohibited. Best management practices shall be employed for the safe handling of these materials to prevent them from entering the water. Equipment for the transportation, storage, handling or application of such materials shall be maintained in a safe and leak-proof condition. If there is evidence of leakage, the further use of such equipment shall be suspended until the cause has been completely corrected. Best management practices shall be employed for prompt and effective clean-up of any spills that occur. A spill prevention and response plan to meet the above requirements may be required by the Director prior to issuance of a permit unless the Director has determined that it is reasonable to provide the plan prior to commencement of construction.
19. Facilities, equipment and established procedures for the containment, recovery and mitigation of spilled petroleum products shall be provided at recreational marinas, commercial marinas, vessel repair facilities, marine service stations and any use regularly servicing vessels that have petroleum product capacities of 10,500 gallons or more. A third party may provide the containment and clean-up of spills if a containment boom, capable of containing a spill from the largest vessel, is available on site and personnel are trained to deploy containment booms around vessels moored at the site.
20. Construction and repair work shall use best management practices to prevent the entry of debris and other waste materials into any water body. No over-water or in-water application of paint, preservative treatment, or other chemical compounds is permitted, except in accordance with best management practices. Any cleaning, sanding, cutting of treated wood, or resurfacing operation occurring over-water or in-water shall employ tarpaulins securely affixed above the water line to prevent material from entering the water. Prior to removing the tarpaulins, the accumulated contents shall be removed by vacuuming or an equivalent method that prevents material from entering the water.
21. Construction staging areas shall be as far from the OHW mark as reasonable. For projects involving concrete, a concrete truck chute cleanout area shall be established to contain wet concrete. All inlets and catch basins shall be protected from fresh concrete, paving, paint stripping and other high-risk pollution generating activities during construction.
22. If at any time project-related activities cause a fish kill, the permittee shall stop all work relating to the fish kill and immediately notify the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspection, WDFW, and Ecology.
23. Navigation channels shall be kept free of hazardous or obstructing development or uses.
24. On waterfront lots uses that are not water-dependent shall be designed and located on the shoreline to encourage efficient use of the shoreline and to allow for water-dependent uses. Design considerations may include additional setbacks from all or a portion of the water's edge, joint use of piers and wharves with water-related or water-dependent uses, development of the lot with a mixture of water-related and water-dependent uses, or other means of ensuring continued efficient use of the shoreline by water-dependent uses.
25. All open areas used for boat storage are required to be screened with natural existing vegetated buffers or planted landscaped areas except for lots with a dry land lot depth of less than 35 feet and areas within the UG, UI and UM Environments. Screening shall include a 5 foot wide landscaping strip with native evergreen plantings at least 3 feet tall. The screening shall be located outside any required sight triangle. The requirement for screening may be waived or modified by the Director to address traffic safety.

    3. Maintenance of the regulated public access is the responsibility of the owner or developer.
4. The Director shall review the type, design, and location of regulated public access to ensure development of a public place meeting the intent of the Shoreline Master Program. The Director shall apply the following criteria in determining what constitutes adequate public access on a specific site:

    1. The location of the access on the lot shall be chosen to:

        1. Maximize the public nature of the access by locating it adjacent to other public areas including street-ends, waterways, parks, other public access and connecting trails;
        2. Maximize views of the water and sun exposure; and
        3. Minimize intrusions into privacy for both site users and public access users by avoiding locations adjacent to private windows and/or outdoor private open spaces and by screening or other separation techniques.
    2. Public amenities appropriate to the usage of the regulated public access space, such as bike racks, benches, picnic tables, public docks and sufficient public parking to serve the users, shall be selected and placed to promote a usable and comfortable public area.
    3. Regulated public access shall be located to avoid interference with the use of the site by water-dependent uses located on the site and minimize interference with the water-dependent uses on adjacent sites.

    1. A comprehensive development plan for the entire project shall be submitted with the first shoreline permit application. The plan shall include all project components intended, plans for the regulated public access, and a development schedule that indicates when various components of regulated public access will be available for public use. The level of detail of the plans for the regulated public access shall be equal to that of the project proposal.
    2. If a regulated public access area for the development has previously been agreed upon during a street vacation process, then the Director shall not require a greater land area for access, but may require development of physical improvements.
    3. A minimum of one regulated public access site shall be provided for each 3,500 linear feet of shoreline unless public access standards are met elsewhere as part of an approved public access plan or public access is not required for the development.
10. General Exceptions.

    1. The requirement for one regulated public access site for each terminal or facility may be waived if the terminal or facility is included in an approved public access plan and the applicant complies with the plan.
    2. In lieu of development of required public access on the lot, an applicant may choose to meet the requirement for regulated public access through payment-in-lieu or by development of public property equivalent to the regulated public access otherwise required if the applicant's lot is located in an area included in an approved regulated public access plan. To be allowed, payment in lieu or development off-site must be allowed by the approved public access plan.
    3. Regulated public access is not required or may be modified if the Director has reviewed all reasonable alternatives for public access, including off-site improvements under the control of the applicant, viewing platforms, and separation of uses through site planning and design, and has determined that either subsection 23.60A.164.J.3.a or 3.b applies:

        1. The site does not qualify for payment-in-lieu or public access development off-site under subsection 23.60A.164.J and one of the following conditions exists:

            1. Unavoidable hazards to the public in gaining access exist;
            2. Inherent security requirements of the use cannot be satisfied;
            3. Unavoidable interference with the use would occur;
            4. Public access at the particular location cannot be developed to satisfy the public interest in providing a recreational, historical, cultural, scientific or educational opportunity or view; or
            5. Adverse impacts to ecological functions that cannot be feasibly mitigated would result; or
        2. The cost of providing regulated public access is unreasonably disproportionate to the total cost of the proposed development, considering the scope of the proposed development and general public's interest in the opportunity to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of shorelines of the State, including views of the water, in which case the Director may adjust the required public access so that the cost is reasonably proportionate.
    4. Access to regulated public access may be denied to any person who creates a nuisance or engages in illegal conduct on the property. The Director may authorize regulated public access to be temporarily or permanently closed if it is found that offensive conduct cannot otherwise be reasonably controlled.
11. Public Access Plan

    1. The Director may approve a public access plan if it:

        1. Meets the requirements of WAC 173-26-221(4); and
        2. Is developed through an open public process as provided in WAC 173-26-201(3)(b)(i).
    2. The Director shall use the interpretation process in subsection 23.88.020.A for plans prepared by other public entities through a process that complies with subsection 23.60A.164.K.1.b. For all other plans the Director shall use the process and procedures prescribed for Type II land use decisions in Chapter 23.76.

            2. The bulkhead is needed to provide load-carrying land immediately adjacent to shoreline that allow heavy trucks access to vessels or heavy equipment for the operation of the use of the site;
            3. The bulkhead and adjacent land is used to provide access to vessels undergoing repair;
            4. The area adjacent to the bulkhead is used for fuel transfer to vessels;
            5. The area adjacent to the bulkhead is used for equipment for the operation of the water-dependent or water-related use of the site;
            6. The bulkhead is required to provide sufficient depth at the shoreline to allow large, deep draft vessels to moor at the docks allowed within the pier head line; or
            7. The bulkhead provides containment of pollution sources to the adjacent water body and is a requirement of an agency mandated cleanup action.
        2. Ecological restoration and enhancement;
        3. Remediation of hazardous substances; or
        4. An existing principal use, principal structure or substantial appurtenant structure that is located 15 feet or less from the OHW mark, or the vertical difference from 5 feet inland of the OHW mark to 5 feet waterward of the OHW mark is greater than 2.5 feet (as illustrated in Exhibit A for 23.60A.188).
    2. Replacement of existing hard stabilization is otherwise prohibited unless the applicant demonstrates the need for replacement by providing a geotechnical report establishing that:

        1. An existing principal structure or substantial appurtenant structure is in imminent danger of erosion damage caused by tidal action, currents, or waves. Imminent danger is demonstrated by the likelihood of either undermining or loss of lateral support for foundations within three years at a constant rate of erosion or vulnerability to a large one-time event; or
        2. Where waiting until an existing principal structure or access to an existing principal structure is in imminent danger as described in subsection 23.60A.188.E.1.a.1 would foreclose the opportunity to use measures that avoid impacts on ecological functions; and
        3. Non-structural and soft stabilization will not provide adequate protection, and the proposed hard stabilization will prevent or reduce structural damage.
    3. Location and size of replacement of existing hard stabilization

        1. Replacement of hard stabilization shall not encroach waterward of the ordinary high-water mark or existing structure unless it is to protect a residence that has been continuously occupied since December 31, 1991, and there are overriding safety or environmental concerns. In such cases, the replacement structure shall abut the existing shoreline stabilization structure.
        2. Replacement of hard stabilization waterward of existing hard stabilization is regulated as new hard stabilization under subsection 23.60A.188.E.
    4. The size of the stabilization measure shall be the minimum necessary.

    6. Where a net loss of ecological functions associated with critical saltwater habitats would occur by leaving the existing structure, it shall be removed as part of the replacement measure.
7. Publicly financed or subsidized shoreline stabilization shall not restrict public access to the shoreline except where such access is determined to be infeasible because of incompatible uses, safety, security, or harm to ecological functions. If feasible, the publicly financed or subsidized shoreline stabilization shall incorporate ecological restoration and enhancement and public access improvements into the project.

    1. In applying mitigation sequencing pursuant to Section 23.60A.158, adverse impacts on ecological functions from shoreline stabilization include, but are not limited to:

        1. the impacts on size of substrate and the effects of beach slope on waves; and
        2. for new or replaced hard stabilization, disturbance of underwater substrate; turbidity; loss or disturbance of food, shelter, spawning, and migration habitat; loss or disturbance of fish runs, biological communities and biodiversity, particularly benthic productivity; and change in water depth including ongoing scouring. Ongoing scouring means the continuation of substrate movement that causes deeper water.
    2. In designing a project, the following priorities are established, and these measures are required to be used in the sequence listed below to reduce the adverse impacts of shoreline stabilization, unless the applicant demonstrates that the priority is inapplicable or not feasible, or that a different sequence or technique will be more effective in reducing adverse impacts.

        1. Approaches to shoreline stabilization. Non-structural practices are required unless infeasible or are not sufficient to provide protection. If non-structural practices are infeasible or insufficient then soft stabilization takes priority over hard stabilization.
        2. Hard stabilization. For new or replaced hard stabilization, the order of priority is as follows:

            1. Riprap;
            2. Terraced and stepped bulkheads with an average slope of 30 percent or less;
            3. Sloped bulkhead, with a slope of 30 percent or less;
            4. Terraced and stepped bulkheads with an average slope that is greater than 30 percent;

        3. The owner/applicant shall demonstrate any expansion will not create future stability problems for the floating on-water residence; and
        4. The owner/applicant shall update the verification records under subsection 23.60A.203.D based on changes made to the floating on-water residence.
4. Verification of a floating on-water residence

    1. Each floating on-water residence shall be verified by the Director, and the owner shall pay a one-time fee to receive a verification number. The fee shall be established by the Director to recover the reasonable costs of the program for issuing a verification number. Owners of a floating on-water residence allowed pursuant to subsection 23.60A.203.B may apply to the Director for verification or may wait until the Director asks for verification information. If a floating on-water residence is not verified, the Director may require the owner to submit verification information and pay the required fee.
    2. Verification shall constitute legal establishment of a floating on-water residence pursuant to the requirements of subsection 23.60A.203.B and the definition of floating on-water residence in Section 23.60A.912.
    3. A house barge authorized under Section 23.60A.204 may submit verification and be regulated as a floating on-water residence rather than a house barge.
    4. If an owner disputes the Director's denial of verification as a floating on-water residence, the owner may appeal the Director's determination to the hearing examiner, in conformance with the hearing examiner rules, within 30 days of date the Director's determination was mailed. The appeal shall be conducted de novo, and the City shall have the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision of the Director was correct. Nothing in this Section 23.60A.203 precludes the City from enforcing this code under Chapter 23.90 if there is no timely appeal to the hearing examiner or following a decision of the hearing examiner upholding the City's denial of floating on-water residence verification.
    5. The owner shall display the verification number issued by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections on the pier and landward side of the floating on-water residence in numerals at least 3 inches high in a location legible from the pier, or on the side most commonly used for access from the pier, or if public access to the pier is not available then on a side visible from the water.
    6. Failure to verify a floating on-water residence or to correctly display a verification number is a violation of this Chapter 23.60A that is subject to the enforcement process in Chapter 23.90 and does not forfeit the owner's right to maintain a floating on-water residence.

##### 23.60A.204 - Floating structures and standards for house barges

1. Floating structures

    1. Floating structures, including vessels that do not have a means of self-propulsion and steering equipment and that are designed or used as a place of residence, with the exception of house barges authorized under subsection 23.60A.204.B and floating on-water residences authorized under Section 23.60A.203, shall be regulated as floating homes pursuant to this Chapter 23.60A.
2. For purposes of this Chapter 23.60A, house barges are only allowed under the following conditions:

    1. The house barge was moored at a recreational marina in the City before July 1990.
    2. A permit for the house barge was secured from the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections verifying that the house barge existed and was used for residential purposes within the City before July 1990 and has been continuously used since that time.
    3. Verification

        1. Each house barge must be verified by the Director, and owners shall pay a one-time fee to receive a verification number. The fee shall be established by the Director to recover the reasonable costs of the program for issuing a verification number. Owners of house barges authorized by this Section 23.60A.204 may apply to the Director for verification or may wait until the Director asks for verification information. If a house barge is not verified pursuant to this subsection 23.60A.204.B, the Director may require the owner to submit verification information and pay the required fee.
        2. If an owner disputes the Director's denial of verification as a house barge under this Section 23.60A.204, the owner may appeal the Director's determination to the hearing examiner, in conformance with the hearing examiner rules, within 30 days of date the Director's determination was mailed. The appeal shall be conducted de novo, and the City shall have the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision of the Director was correct. Nothing in this Section 23.60A.204 precludes the City from enforcing this code under Chapter 23.90 if there is no timely appeal to the hearing examiner or following a decision of the hearing examiner upholding the City's denial of house barge verification.
        3. The owner of a house barge that complies with the requirements of subsections 23.60A.204.B.1 and 23.60A.204.B.2 may choose to have the house barge verified and regulated as a floating on-water residence under Section 23.60A.203 instead of under this Section 23.60A.204.
        4. The owner shall display the verification number issued by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections on the pier and landward side of the vessel, in numerals at least 3 inches high in a location legible from the pier, or on the side most commonly used for access from the pier, or if public access to the pier is not available then on a side visible from the water.
        5. Failure to verify an authorized house barge or correctly display a verification number is a violation of this Chapter 23.60A that is subject to the enforcement process in Chapter 23.90 and does not forfeit the owner's right to maintain an authorized house barge.
    4. A house barge verification number is transferable between owners but is not transferable to another house barge, except to a house barge that has been replaced as provided in subsection 23.60A.204.C.
    5. House barges must be moored at a recreational marina, as defined by Section 23.60A.926.
3. Maintenance and repair, remodeling, relocation, expansion, rebuilding, and replacement

        1. Normal maintenance and repair, as defined in subsection 23.60A.020.C.1, is allowed, and replacement is not considered the common method of repair for this type of structure.
        2. Remodeling is limited to the interior and to changing the siding or architectural features on the exterior of the existing house barge, but no portion of the house barge is expanded, except that exterior open railings may be added as part of a remodel as allowed in subsection 23.60A.204.C.1.c.
        3. Open railings may be added to existing exterior spaces and stairs to access these spaces, but if the top of the railing exceeds the height limits in subsection 23.60A.204.C.1.e, the maximum height of the railing is 36 inches.
        4. Relocation is allowed, and owners should update the house barge verification within 60 days. Failure to update relocation is a violation of this Chapter 23.60A that is subject to the enforcement process in Chapter 23.90 but does not forfeit the owner's right to maintain a house barge.
        5. Expansion is allowed provided that:

            1. The height of the structure including any addition shall not exceed 18 feet if the current height of a house barge is 18 feet or lower, measured from the main deck or 3 feet above the surface of the water, whichever is lower;
            2. The height of the structure including any addition shall not exceed the current height if the current height of the house barge is more than 18 feet but less than 21 feet, measured from the main deck or 3 feet above the surface of the water, whichever is lower;
            3. The height of the structure including any addition shall not exceed 21 feet if the current height of a house barge is 21 feet or more, measured from the main deck or 3 feet above the surface of the water, whichever is lower; and
            4. No expansion of overwater coverage is allowed, except a single expansion at or below the surface of the water may occur as follows:

                1. The applicant provides documentation demonstrating that the expansion is the minimum necessary to provide stability as certified by a naval architect to correct stability problems for the structural size and configuration that existed before July 1990, and the area of such expansion shall not be used for any purpose other than to provide stability; and
                2. If an expansion is allowed under subsection 23.60A.204.C.1.e.4.a, no other expansion is allowed below, at, or above the waterline for any purpose.
            5. If the total expansion over the life of the structure exceeds 120 square feet, gray water containment or a waste-water hookup that disposes the gray water to the City's waste-water disposal system is required.
        6. Replacement to the same size and configuration as established in the verification issued pursuant to subsection 23.60A.204.B, as it may be updated, is allowed and a verified house barge structure is not considered nonconforming even though it may exceed the height limits for additions in subsection 23.60A.204.C.1.e.
        7. Replacement with expansion shall comply with the standards in 23.60A.204.C.1.e, including the requirement that expansions greater than 120 square feet shall provide gray water containment or a waste-water hookup that disposes the gray water to the City's waste-water disposal system.
    2. When an owner of a house barge intends to expand, rebuild, or replace the house barge, prior to beginning any work:

        1. The owner/applicant shall have or obtain the verification required in 23.60A.204.B.3;
        2. The owner/applicant shall present information to the Director demonstrating that the house barge will comply with subsection 23.60A.204.C.1.e, 23.60A.204.C.1.f, and 23.60A.204.C.1.g, as applicable;
        3. The owner/applicant shall demonstrate any expansion will not create future stability problems for the house barge; and
        4. The owner/applicant shall update the verification records under subsection 23.60A.204.B.3 based on changes made to the house barge.
4. Owners and tenants of house barges shall use best management practices pursuant to Section 23.60A.155 to minimize impacts on the aquatic environment.

    2. A vessel, including the dwelling unit portion of the vessel, that meets the standards of subsection 23.60A.214.D.1 but that does not meet the standards of subsection 23.60A.214.B may be:

        1. Maintained and repaired within the vessel overwater coverage existing as the date of this ordinance.
        2. Remodeled and structurally altered within the vessel's existing envelope, including height, width, depth, and overwater coverage, as of the date of this ordinance, except new open railings up to 36 inches in height around existing spaces and stairs to access these spaces are allowed, if the vessel as remodeled or structurally altered will comply with the definition of vessel in Section 23.60A.942.
        3. Relocated to a different moorage within Seattle if the new moorage is in compliance with the marina standards in Section 23.60A.200 and the verification required under subsection 23.60A.214.D.4 to legally establish the vessel is updated with its new marina location.
        4. Replaced with a vessel that complies with subsection 23.60A.214.B.
        5. Rebuilt if destroyed by fire, act of nature, or other causes beyond the control of the owner, excluding normal deterioration of vessels constructed in or over the water, and if:

            1. Action toward replacement is commenced within 12 months after destruction;
            2. The vessel or portion of the vessel is rebuilt to the same or smaller configuration existing immediately prior to the destruction; and
            3. The vessel as rebuilt will comply with the definition of vessel in Section 23.60A.942.
    3. When an owner of a vessel verified according to subsection 23.60A.214.D.4 containing a dwelling unit intends to remodel, structurally alter, or rebuild the vessel, prior to beginning any work the owner shall present information to the Director demonstrating that the vessel as remodeled, structurally altered, or rebuilt will comply with subsections 23.60A.214.D.2.a through 23.60A.214.D.2.e, as applicable, and the verification records for the vessel shall be updated as part of this process.
    4. Verification to legally establish a vessel containing a dwelling unit

        1. The owner of each vessel allowed under subsection 23.60A.214.D.1 that does not qualify for verification under Section 23.60A.203 is required to apply to the Director for a verification number legally establishing the use within six months of the effective date of this ordinance and pay the hourly rate for land use review established by subsection 22.900B.010.B for the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections review time spent to establish the use.
        2. If the Director denies verification as a vessel containing a dwelling unit under this subsection 23.60A.214.D and an owner disputes the Director's denial of verification, the owner may appeal the Director's determination to the hearing examiner, in conformance with the hearing examiner rules, within 30 days of the date the Director's determination was mailed. The appeal shall be conducted de novo, and the City shall have the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision of the Director was correct. Nothing in this Section 23.60A.214 precludes the City from enforcing this code under Chapter 23.90 if there is no timely appeal to the hearing examiner or following a decision of the hearing examiner upholding the City's denial of verification under this subsection 23.60A.214.D.

        4. Failure to apply within six months for verification legally establishing the use as a vessel containing a dwelling unit or correctly display a verification number is a violation of this Chapter 23.60A that is subject to the enforcement process in Chapter 23.90 but does not forfeit the owner's right to maintain a vessel containing a dwelling unit.
        5. Verification is transferable between owners but is not transferable to another vessel, except to a rebuilt vessel as provided in subsection 23.60A.214.D.2.e.
5. Owners and tenants of vessels containing dwelling units shall use best management practices pursuant to Section 23.60A.155 to minimize impacts on the aquatic environment.
6. If the Director has issued an order finding a vessel does not qualify as a conventional recreational vessel under subsection 23.60A.214.B.1, the owner may appeal the Director's determination to the hearing examiner within 30 days of the date the Director's determination was mailed pursuant to the provisions in Chapter 23.76.

    2. Any undesignated shorelines are designated Conservancy Preservation.
    3. Submerged lands seaward of the Outer Harbor Line, Construction Limit Line or other navigational boundary that are not specifically designated or shown on the Official Land Use Map shall be designated Conservancy Navigation.
2. Submerged Lands

    1. On Puget Sound, Lake Washington and Green Lake, submerged lands shall be designated as shoreline environments that preserve them for ecological functions and public or recreational purposes.
    2. On Elliott Bay, Lake Union, the Ship Canal, and the Duwamish River, submerged lands shall be designated as shoreline environments that balance preservation of ecological functions and a mix of public, recreational, industrial, and commercial purposes. In these areas; the environmental designation given to submerged lands is generally the same as the abutting waterfront dry land and extends to the outer Harbor Line, Construction Limit Line, or other navigational boundary.
    3. Where the shoreline environment designation on submerged land is different from the shoreline environment designation of the adjacent dry land, the environment boundary is the OHW mark in freshwater environments and mean higher high water in saltwater environments.
3. For the purpose of this Chapter 23.60A, the Shoreline District is divided into 11 environments.
4. The purpose and locational criteria for each shoreline environment are as follows:

    1. Conservancy Management (CM) Environment

        1. Purpose. The purpose of the CM Environment is to provide for water-dependent infrastructure, such as navigational locks, that provide a substantial public benefit, and recreational facilities, such as marinas and parks. Development allowed in the CM Environment can be managed to preserve ecological functions and typically provide public access.
        2. Locational Criteria

            1. Dry or submerged land that is generally owned by a public agency and developed with a major infrastructure or a recreational facility, including navigation locks and marinas;
            2. Public and private parks; or

        2. Locational Criteria

            1. Areas zoned Industrial;
            2. Areas adjacent to or part of major industrial centers that provide support services for water-dependent and other industrial uses; or
            3. Areas where predominant uses are water-dependent or water-related manufacturing, warehousing, major port cargo facilities, or other similar uses.
    10. Urban Maritime (UM) Environment

        1. Purpose. The purpose of the UM Environment is to:

            1. Provide for efficient use of industrial and commercial shorelines by water-dependent and water-related uses;
            2. Provide public access mainly on public lands or in conformance with an area-wide Public Access Plan;
            3. Accommodate ecological restoration and enhancement where reasonable; and
            4. Allow limited nonwater-oriented uses and development where they would not displace water-oriented uses and, if located on waterfront lots, where they achieve another goal of the Shoreline Management Act, such as protection or improvement of ecological functions or public access.

            1. Areas zoned Industrial or Commercial 2 with sufficient dry land for industrial uses but generally in smaller parcels than in the UI Environment;
            2. Areas developed predominantly with water-related manufacturing or commercial uses or a combination of manufacturing-commercial and recreational water-dependent uses;
            3. Areas with concentrations of state waterways for use by commerce and navigation; or
            4. Areas near, but not necessarily adjacent to, residential or Neighborhood Commercial zones that require protection from the impacts of heavy industrialization and are therefore inappropriate for a UI Environment designation.
    11. Urban Residential (UR) Environment

        1. Purpose. The purpose of the UR Environment is to provide for single-family residential development and accessory structures, while protecting ecological functions. Multifamily residential development is allowed in this environment where the underlying zone, as of the date of this ordinance, allows multifamily residential development.

##### 23.60A.950 - Measurements in the Shoreline District

Measurements of height, view corridors, lot coverage, and other shoreline requirements in the Shoreline District shall be as described in this Subchapter XVII. These measurement regulations supplement other regulations of this title as described in Section 23.60A.016. When a development is partly within and partly outside the Shoreline District, measurement techniques for that portion of the development outside of the Shoreline District shall be as required in the underlying zone.


##### 23.60A.952 - Height

Height of structures shall be determined by measuring from the average grade of the lot immediately prior to the proposed development to the highest point of the structure not otherwise excepted from the height limits. Calculation of the average grade level shall be made by averaging the elevations at the center of all exterior walls of the proposed building or structure. In the case of structures to be built over water, average grade level shall be the elevation of ordinary high water.


##### 23.60A.954 - View corridors

When a view corridor is required, it shall be provided according to the development standards set forth in Section 23.60A.170 using the following measurement techniques:


1. The width of the view corridor or corridors shall be determined by calculating the required percent of the width of the lot at the street or upland lot line;
2. The view corridor or corridors shall be in the direction of the predominant view of the water and, when topographically possible, generally parallel to existing view corridors;
3. When a lot is bounded by more than one street, the Director shall determine which street front shall be used for the view corridor calculation; the determination shall be based on consideration of the relative amounts of traffic on each of the streets, the direction of the predominant view of the water and the availability of actual views of the water.

##### 23.60A.956 - Calculation of lot depth

In certain environments, regulation of development differs according to the depth of the dry land portion of the lot. To qualify for some special regulations, a lot must have a specified depth of dry land. To qualify for locating single-family residences cantilevered over water, a lot must have less than 30 feet but at least 15 feet of dry land.


1. The Director shall determine the lot depth as described below:

    1. If the lot abuts a street or railroad right-of-way that is generally parallel to the shoreline, the lot depth is the distance measured in a straight line, parallel to the street or railroad right-of-way and extending to the OHW mark or MHHW between two lot lines, for more than 50 percent of the lot; or
    2. If the lot lines and/or street or railroad right-of-way are irregular, the Director may determine the lot depth, based upon the intent of the Shoreline Master Program.
2. A lot shall be determined by the Director to have a depth of less than 30 feet but at least 15 feet of dry land if:

    1. The lot abuts a street or railroad right-of-way that is generally parallel to the shoreline; and
    2. A straight line, parallel to and 15 feet waterward of the street or railroad right-of-way and extending between two lot lines, crosses dry land for more than 50 percent of its distance; and
    3. A straight line, parallel to and 30 feet waterward of the street or railroad right-of-way and extending between two lot lines, crosses submerged land for more than 50 percent of its distance; or
    4. If the lot lines and/or street or railroad right-of-way are irregular, the Director may determine whether the lot has a depth of less than 30 feet but at least 15 feet of dry land, based on the intent of the Shoreline Master Program.

##### 23.60A.958 - Calculation of percent of a development site occupied by a specific use

The following measurement techniques shall be used to calculate the percentage of a development site occupied by a use for developments.


1. For purpose of this Section 23.60A.958, the development site includes all the area within the Shoreline District including vacant lands, submerged and dry lands, and lands currently and proposed to be leased from DNR for the development, but excluding any area required for public access. Submerged lands shall not be counted in calculating lot area for purposes of minimum lot area requirements of single-family zones or density standards of other zones.
2. All lot area occupied by a specific use shall include:

    1. The footprint, including balconies, decks and eaves, of any structure occupied by the use or its accessory uses; provided, that if a structure is occupied by more than one use, the amount of the structure's footprint allocated to any one use shall be calculated proportionately to its share of the structure's total floor area as follows: the square footage of the structure's footprint allocated to any one use (A) is equal to the total square footage of the structure's footprint (B) multiplied by the total square footage of the use and its accessory uses located within the structure (C) divided by the total square footage within the structure (D), expressed as the following equation:
A = B × C/D


1. The area outside of any structure, occupied by the use or its accessory uses, including the following:

    1. Areas devoted to parking or access shall be as counted water-dependent and water-related uses to the extent that the parking or access is required by code for the water-dependent or water-related use on the development site;
    2. The area of any moorage occupied by the use including piers, floats, dockage areas, channels, and turning basins;
    3. The area occupied by any storage accessory to the use.
2. The percent of the development site occupied by a specific use shall be calculated by dividing the use area calculated in subsection 23.60A.958.B by the development site area given in subsection 23.60A.958.A multiplied by 100.
3. To calculate the percent of dry land or percent of submerged lands occupied by a specific use or category of use, the dry lands and submerged lands shall each be calculated separately.
4. To calculate the percent of area occupied by a category of use such as nonwater-oriented commercial, the area occupied by all such uses as calculated above shall be summed and divided by the development site area.

##### 23.60A.962 - Calculation of lot width for piers accessory to residential development

The following measurement technique shall be used to calculate whether or not lot width at the line of ordinary high water is sufficient to comply with the requirement of subsection 23.60A.187.C:


1. Lot width shall be the distance measured in a straight line between the points where the lot lines intersect the ordinary high water mark.
2. If the lot lines, ordinary high water mark or other conditions are irregular, the Director may determine if the lot meets the lot width criterion, based on the intent of the Shoreline Master Program.

![23-64-004-2.png](./images/23-64-004-2.png)


Exhibit 23.64.004B


1. The Airport Height Overlay District shall be divided into five (5) types of overlay areas. The areas shall be the Inner Approach Area (IA), Outer Approach Area (OA), Turning Area (TG), Conical Area (CA), and the Transition Areas (TN). The boundaries shall be based on the imaginary surfaces developed by the Federal Aviation Administration for height limits surrounding airports. For purposes of illustration, the spatial representation of the imaginary surfaces is shown in Exhibit 23.64.004 A. The boundaries of these imaginary surfaces as projected on a map of the City are shown for illustrative purposes only in Exhibit 23.64.004 B. The actual boundary locations of the overlay areas are shown on the Official Airport Height Map, which is part of Exhibit A established pursuant to Chapter 23.32 of the Land Use Code.
2. The "Primary Surface" is defined as a surface longitudinally centered on the King County International Airport runways, which extends two hundred feet (200') beyond the end of the runway and is one thousand feet (1,000') wide. The primary surface is at the elevation of the runway.
3. The "Inner Approach Area" is defined as that area which lies directly below imaginary inclined surfaces (the "Inner Approach Surfaces") longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from the north and south ends of the primary surface. The inner edges of the inner approach surfaces are one thousand (1,000) feet wide and expand uniformly to a width of four thousand (4,000) feet. The inner approach surfaces extend for a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet at a slope of fifty (50) horizontal to one (1) vertical.
4. The "Outer Approach Area" is defined as that area which lies directly below imaginary inclined surfaces (the "Outer Approach Surfaces") longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from the north and south outer edges of the inner approach surfaces. The inner edges of the outer approach surfaces are four thousand feet (4,000') wide and expand uniformly to a width of eight thousand feet (8,000'). The outer approach surfaces extend for a horizontal distance of forty thousand feet (40,000') at a slope of forty (40) horizontal to one (1) vertical.
5. The "Turning Area" is defined as that area which lies directly below an imaginary horizontal oval surface (the "Turning Surface") one hundred fifty feet (150') above the established airport elevation (which is seventeen feet (17') above sea level), the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging ten-thousand-foot (10,000') radii arcs from the center of the end of the primary surface and by connecting the adjacent arcs with parallel lines tangent to those arcs.
6. The "Conical Area" is defined as that area which lies directly below an imaginary surface (the "Conical Surface") which extends outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty (20) horizontal to one (1) vertical for a horizontal distance of four thousand feet (4,000').
7. The "Transitional Areas" are defined as the areas which lie directly below the imaginary inclined surfaces (the "Transitional Surfaces") which extend outward and upward from the edges of the primary surface and the inner and outer approach surfaces. The transitional surfaces extend at a slope of seven (7) horizontal to one (1) vertical at right angles to the runway centerline and extension of the runway centerline. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the approach surfaces which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of five thousand feet (5,000') measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at right angles to the runway centerline. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the inner approach surface and the primary surface extend up to the turning surface.

#### 23.64.006 - Development standards.

1. No structure shall be erected, or altered, in any area defined in this section to a height in excess of the limits established in this chapter unless otherwise provided.
2. The maximum height permitted for structures and trees in each area shall be as follows, and shall be known as the height limits of the Airport Height Overlay District:

    1. In Inner Approach Areas (IA), the boundaries of which are shown on the Official Airport Height Map, structures and trees shall not exceed the height of the Inner Approach Surface. This shall not restrict heights in Inner Approach Areas to less than thirty-seven feet (37').
    2. In Outer Approach Areas (OA), the boundaries of which are shown on the Official Airport Height Map, structures and trees shall not exceed the height of the Outer Approach Surface.
    3. In Turning Areas (TN), the boundaries of which are shown on the Official Airport Height Map, structures and trees shall not exceed the height of the Turning Surface. This shall not restrict heights in Turning Areas to less than sixty-five feet (65').
    4. In Conical Areas (CA), the boundaries of which are shown on the Official Airport Height Map, structures and trees shall not exceed the height of the Conical Surface. This shall not restrict heights in Conical Areas to less than sixty-five feet (65').
    5. In Transition Areas (TN), the boundaries of which are shown on the Official Airport Height Map, structures and trees shall not exceed the height of the inclined Transition Surfaces. This shall not restrict heights in Transition Areas to less than thirty-seven feet (37').
3. Trees exceeding the height limits of the Airport Height Overlay District shall not be required to be cut or trimmed to conform to the height limits of the Airport Height Overlay District unless the Director is notified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that the trees are a potential hazard to aviation.

#### 23.64.008 - Application of regulations.

All properties located within the Airport Height Overlay District shall be subject to both the requirements of the underlying zone classification and to the requirements imposed for the Airport Height Overlay District. At no time shall the provisions of this chapter be read to modify the provisions of the underlying zoning, other overlay districts or special districts, except for height restrictions stated in this chapter. In any case where the provisions of the Airport Height Overlay District conflict with the provisions of the underlying zone, the more restrictive height limit shall apply.


#### 23.64.010 - Special exception.

The Director may permit a structure to exceed the limits of the Airport Height Overlay District as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions. Such an exception shall only be permitted if the Director finds that all of the following conditions exist:


1. The Federal Aviation Administration advises the Director that the exception to the height limits does not create a hazard to aviation; and
2. The additional height is necessary for the successful physical function of the structure; and
3. The exception will not result in re-routing of aircraft; and
4. The structure is designed to minimize adverse impacts of lighting on surrounding uses while complying with the lighting requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration.

Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the additional information, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested.
    4. The determination of completeness does not preclude the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods or the board from requiring additional information during the review process if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the criteria in this chapter and in any rules adopted by the board, or if the proposed work changes. For example, additional information that may be required could include a shadow study or a traffic study when new construction is proposed.
    5. An applicant may make a written request to submit an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design of a project if the applicant waives in writing the deadline for a board recommendation and decision by the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods on the subsequent design phase or phases of the project, and agrees in writing that the decision by the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods on the preliminary design is immediately appealable by the applicant or any interested person. The staff may reject the request if it appears that approval of a preliminary design would not be an efficient use of staff or board time and resources, or would not further the goals and objectives of this chapter. To be complete, an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design must include the information listed above in subsection C2, subparagraphs a through h, i(1) through i(3), j, m and n. A certificate of approval that is granted for a preliminary design shall be conditioned upon subsequent submittal of the final design and all of the information listed above in subsection C2, and upon board approval, prior to issuance of permits for work affecting the structure, right-of-way or space.
    6. After the special review board has given notice of the meeting at which an application for a certificate of approval will be considered, no other application for the same alteration or change of use may be submitted until the application is withdrawn or the Department of Neighborhoods Director has approved or denied the existing application and all appeals have been concluded, except that an application may be made for a certificate of approval for the preliminary design of a project and a later application made for a certificate of approval for a subsequent design phase or phases of the same project.
4. Review

    1. Review when no special review board is established

        1. When there is no special review board, the Department of Neighborhoods Director shall, within 30 days of a determination that an application for a certificate of approval is complete, determine whether the proposed action is consistent with the use and development standards for the district and shall, within 15 additional days, issue, issue with conditions, or deny the requested certificate of approval.
        2. A copy of the Department of Neighborhoods Director's decision shall be sent to the Director and mailed to the owner and the applicant at the addresses provided in the application. Notice of the Director's decision also shall be provided to any person who, prior to the rendering of the decision, made a written request to receive notice of the decision or submitted written substantive comments on the application.
    2. Review when special review board is established

        1. When a special review board has been established, the board shall hold a public meeting to receive comments on certificate of approval applications.
        2. Notice of the board's public meeting shall be posted in two prominent locations in the district at least three days prior to the meeting.
        3. The board, after reviewing the application and considering the information received at the public meeting, shall make a written recommendation to the Department of Neighborhoods Director to grant, grant with conditions, or deny the certificate of approval application based upon the consistency of the proposed action with the requirements of this Chapter 23.66, the district use and development standards, and the purposes for creating the district. The board shall make its recommendation within 30 days of the receipt of a completed application by the board staff, except that the applicant may waive the deadlines in writing for the special review board to make a recommendation or the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to make a decision, if the applicant also waives any deadlines on the review or issuance of related permits that are under review by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections.
        4. The Department of Neighborhoods Director shall, within 15 days of receiving the board's recommendation, issue or deny a certificate of approval or issue an approval with conditions.
        5. A copy of the decision shall be sent to the Director and mailed to the owner and the applicant at the addresses provided in the application. Notice of the decision shall be provided to any person who, prior to the rendering of the decision, made a written request for notice of the decision, or submitted substantive written comments on the application.
    3. A decision denying a certificate of approval shall state the specific reasons for the denial and explain why the proposed changes are inconsistent with the requirements of this Subchapter I and adopted use and development standards for the district.
5. Appeal to Hearing Examiner

    1. Any interested person may appeal the decision of the Department of Neighborhoods Director to the Hearing Examiner by filing a notice of appeal within 14 days of the Department of Neighborhoods Director's decision. When the proposed action that is the subject of the certificate of approval is also the subject of one or more related permit applications under review by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, then the appellant must also file notice of the appeal with the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, and the appeal of the certificate of approval shall not be heard until all of the time periods for filing administrative appeals on the other permits or any environmental determinations have expired, except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for the preliminary design or for subsequent design phases may proceed immediately without being consolidated. The appeal of the certificate of approval shall be consolidated with the predecision hearing required for any Type IV Council land use decision, or if one or more appeals are filed regarding the other permits or environmental determinations, the appeal of the certificate of approval shall be consolidated with them and shall be heard according to the same timelines established for the other appeals or predecision hearing, except that appeals to the State Shoreline Hearings Board shall proceed independently according to the timelines set by the state for such appeals, and except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for a preliminary design or for a subsequent design phase may proceed without being consolidated.
    2. If the related permit decisions would not be appealable, and no predecision hearing is required, then the appeal of the certificate of approval decision shall proceed immediately after it is filed.
    3. The applicant for the certificate of approval, not involving approval of preliminary and subsequent design phases also may elect to have the appeal proceed immediately rather than be postponed for consolidation with appeals of related permit applications or with a predecision hearing, if the applicant agrees in writing that the time period for review of those permits or approvals is suspended until the Hearing Examiner issues a decision on the appeal of the certificate of approval.
    4. The Hearing Examiner shall hear the appeal de novo in accordance with the standards and procedures established for Hearing Examiner appeals by Chapter 3.02. Appeals shall be limited to the issues cited in the notice of appeal. The decision appealed may be reversed or modified only if the Hearing Examiner finds that the Department of Neighborhoods Director's decision was arbitrary and capricious.
    5. If evidence is presented to the Hearing Examiner that was not presented to the Board, or if the Hearing Examiner determines that additional information is required, then the Hearing Examiner shall remand the decision to the Department of Neighborhoods Director for consideration of the additional information or evidence.
    6. The Hearing Examiner shall issue a decision not later than 90 days after the last of any appeals of related permit decisions is filed provided that, when an appeal of a certificate of approval is consolidated with a predecision hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall issue the decision on the certificate of approval with the recommendation to the City Council on a Type IV Council land use decision, or, if the applicant chooses to proceed immediately with the appeal of the certificate of approval, as provided in subsection 23.66.030.E.3, then not later than 90 days from the filing of that appeal. The time period to consider and decide the appeal of a certificate of approval shall be exempt from the deadlines for review and decision on both the certificate of approval and any related permit applications or approvals.
    7. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final. Copies of the Hearing Examiner's decision shall be provided to all parties of record before the Hearing Examiner. Any judicial review must be commenced as provided by state law.
6. Revocation of Certificates of Approval. Building construction, remodeling, restoration, renovation, removal, demolition and use shall conform to the requirements of the certificate of approval granted by the Department of Neighborhoods Director. Approval may be revoked for failure to comply with this chapter, the ordinance creating the district, or the conditions of the certificate of approval.
7. Expiration of Certificates of Approval. A certificate of approval for a use shall be valid as long as the use is authorized by the applicable codes. Any other type of certificate of approval shall be valid for 18 months from the date of issuance of the decision granting it unless the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods grants an extension in writing; provided however, that certificates of approval for actions subject to permits issued by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall be valid for the life of the permit issued by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, including any extension granted by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections in writing.

##### 23.66.032 - Contributing structures; determination of architectural or historic significance

1. The owner of a lot in the Pioneer Square Preservation District or the International Special Review District may apply to the Director of Neighborhoods for a determination that a structure on the lot contributes, and is expected to continue to contribute, to the architectural and/or historic character of the District. A structure for which that determination is made is considered a contributing structure for purposes of this Section 23.66.032 and for purposes of the eligibility of the lot to send South Downtown Historic TDR or South Downtown Historic TDP pursuant to Sections 23.49.014 and 23.58A.042. The determination is made by the Director of Neighborhoods, after recommendation by the Pioneer Square Preservation Board or the International Special Review District Board. A structure for which an application for demolition approval has been granted or is pending is not eligible for a determination under this Section 23.66.032. The Director of Neighborhoods may defer consideration of an application under this Section 23.66.032 until final action is taken on any application for a certificate of approval, and any appeals have been resolved.
2. In making a recommendation and decision under subsection 23.66.032.A, the relevant Board and the Director of Neighborhoods shall take into account the reasons for designating the District as set forth in Section 23.66.100 or 23.66.302 and how they apply to the structure; whether the structure was identified as historic or as contributing, or both, for purposes of listing in the National Register of Historic Places or the local special review district; and the state of historic integrity, repair, maintenance, and useful life of the structure. The Director of Neighborhoods and the relevant Board may rely on information submitted by the owner, information provided by members of the public, other information available in public records, and site visits. The Director of Neighborhoods may determine that the structure is contributing; that it cannot be contributing; or that it will be contributing conditioned upon specific rehabilitation or maintenance work.
3. If the Director of Neighborhoods determines that the structure will be contributing conditioned upon rehabilitation or maintenance work, then the owner shall not be entitled to a final determination, and the structure shall not be considered contributing for purposes of this Title 23, until either (1) the work is completed to the satisfaction of the Director of Neighborhoods, or (2) a certificate of approval for the work is issued and the owner provides a bond or other security acceptable to the Director of Neighborhoods for the completion of the work.
4. The owner shall submit to the Director of Neighborhoods, in support of a request for a determination under this Section 23.66.032, a historic resource report prepared by a historic preservation consultant approved by the Director of Neighborhoods. The historic resource report shall include the information described in this subsection 23.66.032.D, except that the Director of Neighborhoods may allow the omission of information not necessary for a particular application:

    1. History of the structure, including significant historical events, persons and uses associated with the structure;
    2. Ownership history;
    3. Construction history, including original plans and subsequent alterations to the exterior; a chronology of historical documentation; site work, references to craftsmen, builders, and architects associated with the structure; early views, photographs, and other materials showing appearance at different periods; and results of physical investigation;
    4. Architectural evaluation, including an assessment of all exterior features and finishes and identification of those architectural features, materials, finishes and construction techniques that are character-defining.
    5. An analysis of existing conditions, damage, structural problems, and materials deterioration.

#### Subchapter II - Pioneer Square Preservation District

Part 1 General Purpose and Organization

##### 23.66.100 - Creation of district, legislative findings and purpose

1. During the City of Seattle's relatively brief history, it has had little time in which to develop areas of consistent historical or architectural character. It is recognized that the Pioneer Square area of Seattle contains many of these rare attributes and consequently is an area of great historical and cultural significance. Further, the regional sports stadiums, constructed in and near the Pioneer Square area, and the traffic and activities that they generate have resulted in adverse impacts upon the social, cultural, historic and ethnic values of the Pioneer Square area. To preserve, protect, and enhance the historic character of the Pioneer Square area and the buildings therein; to return unproductive structures to useful purposes; to attract visitors to the City; to avoid a proliferation of vehicular parking and vehicular-oriented uses; to provide regulations for existing on-street and off-street parking; to stabilize existing housing, and encourage a variety of new and rehabilitated housing types for all income groups; to encourage the use of transportation modes other than the private automobile; to protect existing commercial vehicle access; to improve visual and urban relationships between existing and future buildings and structures, parking spaces and public improvements within the area; and to encourage pedestrian uses, there is established as a special review district, the Pioneer Square Preservation District. The boundaries of the District are shown on Map A for 23.66.100 and on the Official Land Use Map.
2. The District is depicted on Map A for 23.66.100. All property in the entire District shall be developed and used in accordance with the use and development standards established in this Chapter 23.66 and the use and development standards for the underlying zone in which the property is located. In the event of irreconcilable differences between the use and development standards of this Chapter 23.66 and other provisions of this Land Use Code, this Chapter 23.66 applies, except that nothing in this Chapter 23.66 shall permit any use or development on a lot from which TDR or TDP are transferred that is inconsistent with the restrictions applicable as a result of such transfer pursuant to Chapter 23.49 or Chapter 23.58A.
3. Reasons for Designating the Pioneer Square Preservation District.

    1. Historic Significance. The Pioneer Square Preservation District is unique because it is the site of the beginning of The City of Seattle. The area also retains much of the original architecture and artifacts of its early history. The District has played a significant role in the development of Seattle, the Puget Sound region and The State of Washington. It was the first location of industry, business and homes in early Seattle and the focus of commerce and transportation for more than a half century.
    2. Architectural Significance. As a collection of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century buildings of similar materials, construction techniques and architectural style, the District is unique, not only to the City but to the country as well. Most of the buildings within the District embody the distinctive characteristics of the Late Victorian style. Many buildings are the work of one architect, Elmer H. Fisher. For these and other reasons, the buildings combine to create an outstanding example of an area that is distinguishable in style, form, character and construction representative of its era.
    3. Social Diversity. The District represents an area of unique social diversity where people from many income levels and social strata live, shop and work. It is an area in which social services, including missions, low-income housing and service agencies exist.
    4. Business Environment. The District is an area of remarkable business diversity. The street level of the area north of S. King Street is pedestrian-oriented, with its storefronts occupied primarily by specialty retail shops, art galleries, restaurants and taverns. The upper floors of buildings in the historic core are occupied by professional offices, various types of light manufacturing, and housing for persons of many income groups. The area south of S. King Street includes the stadium's north parking lot, a number of structures occupied by light manufacturing and warehousing use, and several structures converted to office, residential and mixed use. The stadium's north parking lot may be redeveloped to accommodate a mix of uses, including a substantial amount of housing. The ongoing restoration and sensitive rehabilitation of many District structures, combined with proposed compatible new construction, will continue to enhance the District's economic climate.
    5. Educational Value. The restoration and preservation of the District will yield information of educational significance regarding the way of life and the architecture of the late nineteenth-century as well as adding interest and color to the City. Restoration of the District will preserve the environment that was characteristic of an important era of Seattle's history.
    6. Geographic Location. The District is uniquely situated adjacent to Seattle's waterfront, the central business district, the International District, and sports stadium and exhibition center facilities.

#### Subchapter III - International Special Review District

Part 1 General Purposes and Organization

##### 23.66.302 - International Special Review District goals and objectives

The International District is the urban focal point for the Asian American community. The International Special Review District is established to promote, preserve and perpetuate the cultural, economic, historical, and otherwise beneficial qualities of the area, particularly the features derived from its Asian heritage, by:


1. Reestablishing the District as a stable residential neighborhood with a mixture of housing types;
2. Encouraging the use of street-level spaces for pedestrian-oriented retail specialty shops with colorful and interesting displays;
3. Protecting the area and its periphery from the proliferation of parking lots and other automobile-oriented uses;
4. Encouraging the rehabilitation of existing structures;
5. Improving the visual and urban design relationships between existing and future buildings, parking garages, open spaces and public improvements within the International District;
6. Exercising a reasonable degree of control over site development and the location of off-street parking and other automobile-oriented uses; and
7. Discouraging traffic and parking resulting from athletic stadium events and commuters working outside the District.
All property within the International Special Review District, as designated on the Official Land Use Map, shall be subject to the use and development standards of the underlying zoning and the applicable use and development standards of this Chapter 23.66. In the event of irreconcilable differences between the use and development standards of this Chapter 23.66 and the provisions of the underlying zone or other chapters of the Seattle Municipal Code or other City ordinances, this Chapter 23.66 applies, except that nothing in this Chapter 23.66 shall permit any use or development on a lot from which TDR or TDP are transferred that is inconsistent with the restrictions applicable as a result of such transfer pursuant to Chapter 23.49 or Chapter 23.58A. The boundaries of the International Special Review District are shown on the Official Land Use Map, and on Map A for 23.66.302, included at the end of this Chapter 23.66.


##### 23.66.304 - International District Mixed (IDM) Zone goals and objectives.

The IDM zone designation shall recognize and promote the area's unique social mix and urban design character. This area is the core of the International District which exemplifies Asian culture. A wide range of uses, including street-level retail, housing development above street level, and the rehabilitation of existing buildings, shall be encouraged. New residential uses and the rehabilitation of existing structures shall be encouraged to provide a diversity of residential opportunities. Specific objectives include the following:


1. To maintain and protect the International District core as an Asian cultural, retail and residential center;
2. To allow flexibility and discretion in land use controls, regulations and guidelines to address present conditions and those which may develop in the future;
3. To protect, preserve and promote small retail and commercial businesses;
4. To encourage development of housing above street level;
5. To encourage the rehabilitation of existing buildings; and
6. To assure new development compatible in scale and character with existing buildings.

##### 23.66.306 - International District Residential (IDR) Zone goals and objectives

The International District residential area shall be predominantly a residential neighborhood with primarily residential uses. Other compatible uses shall be permitted to the extent that they reinforce and do not detract from the primary use of the area. The IDR designation and the regulations of the International Special Review District shall recognize and promote the area's unique social and urban design character. Special objectives include:


1. The establishment of the International District area north of South Jackson Street as one of downtown's predominant residential neighborhoods;
2. The development of flexible land use controls, regulations and guidelines to address present conditions and those which may develop in the future;
3. The design, siting, and construction of structures that minimize view blockage from Kobe Terrace Park and from existing structures that are used primarily for residential purposes;
4. The design, siting and construction of structures in a manner that allows reasonable solar exposure and air circulation to adjacent properties;
5. The design, siting and construction of structures that are aesthetically compatible with the area's steep topography and/or nearby public open spaces.

##### 23.66.308 - International District preferred uses east of Interstate 5

Preferred uses for that portion of the International District that lies east of Interstate 5 include restaurants, retail shops, residential uses, and other small- and medium-scale commercial uses. Commercial businesses and uses with an Asian product, service or trade emphasis are preferred. Preferred uses should contribute to the International District's business core or to the function and purposes of the International District east of Interstate 5.


##### 23.66.310 - Union Station Corridor goals and objectives

The Union Station Corridor is that area bounded by Yesler Way, Fifth Avenue South, Airport Way South, and Fourth Avenue South. The City, in cooperation with King County Metro, local property owners and the affected community, formulated a strategy for the redevelopment of the Union Station Corridor in coordination with the Downtown Transit Project. Specific objectives for a Planned Community Development in the Union Station Corridor include the following:


1. Preservation. The historic Union Station structure should be retained and rehabilitated with consideration given to a mix of private and public uses.
2. Uses. Development in the Corridor should incorporate a mix of uses, such as office, housing, hotel and retail uses in conformance with its International District zoning and the regulations of the International Special Review District. Retention of existing low-income housing should be given a high priority. Consideration should be given to the inclusion of public open space and public uses serving the community.
3. Planned Community Development. The provisions of Section 23.49.036, Planned Community Developments, apply in the area. This procedure allows projects to modify the provisions of the IDM designation as long as the entire project is in conformance. All planned community developments shall be reviewed by the International Special Review District Board which shall make a recommendation to the Director of Neighborhoods.
4. Open Space. Public open space has been included in development in the area, and if applicable to future development proposals, consideration should be given to the retention and enhancement of a linear open space along Fifth Avenue south of Jackson Street, as an open space resource and a major focal point at the west end of King Street.
5. Parking. The number of parking spaces provided in the corridor should be sufficient to meet the requirements for development in the corridor, as well as to contribute to the long-range needs of the International District.
6. Scale. Building height and bulk should conform to the IDM Zone designation and the regulations of the International Special Review District. Development south of Jackson Street should preserve the Union Station building as the dominant structure.
7. View Corridors. Views from Jackson and King Streets should be retained.
8. Pedestrian Environment. To provide a pedestrian link between the International District retail core and Pioneer Square, a pedestrian connection should be retained south of King Street. Consideration should be given to pedestrian improvements along Jackson Street and along Fifth Avenue between Jackson Street and Airport Way South such as streetscaping, widened sidewalks and benches, to "humanize" what are now vehicular-oriented streets.

##### 23.66.312 - Composition of the Special Review Board.

The International District Special Review Board (hereafter, the "Board") shall consist of seven (7) members, five (5) of whom are elected and two (2) of whom are appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council. The five (5) elected members of the Board shall consist of two (2) members who own property in the International District, or who own or are employed by businesses located in the International District; two (2) members who are either residents (including tenants), or persons with a recognized and demonstrated interest in the welfare of the International District Community; and one (1) member at large. One (1) member of the Pioneer Square Special Review Board shall serve as a nonvoting member appointed by the Pioneer Square Special Review Board to serve at that Board's pleasure.


##### 23.66.314 - Staff support for the Special Review Board.

The Department of Neighborhoods Director shall provide staff and clerical support for the Board, and shall assign a member of the Department's staff to act as Board Coordinator. The Coordinator shall be the custodian of the Board's records, handle official correspondence, and organize and supervise the clerical and technical work of the Board.

To strengthen and preserve the existing Asian architectural character of the Asian Design Character District, tiled awnings, recessed balconies, heavy timber construction, and materials and colors as specified below are encouraged.

    1. Materials. Building facades are limited to earthen materials such as brick, concrete, stucco and wood. Other materials may be used if approved by the Director of Neighborhoods. Brick and concrete may not be painted unless approved by the Director of Neighborhoods. Stucco may be used in conjunction with other contrasting materials such as dark stained wood. Decorative ceramic glazed roof tiles are encouraged, as are tiled awnings and marquees if appropriately integrated into the overall design.
    2. Colors. Building facade colors must be reviewed by the Special Review Board and approved by the Director of Neighborhoods. Colors shall be compatible with those of adjacent buildings.
    3. Surfaces. Textured concrete, brick and wood surfaces are preferred over non-textured surfaces. Recesses and voids that break up monotonous surface areas and create visual relief are encouraged. The design and location of mechanical equipment visible from the street must be reviewed by the Board and approved by the Director of Neighborhoods.
    4. Transparency Requirement. Street-level uses shall have highly visible linkages with the street. Transparent surfaces shall be provided for at least 50 percent of the exposed street-facing facade measured between sidewalk level and a height of 10 feet or the height of the second floor level, whichever is less. The average height of window sills shall be no greater than 3 feet above the sidewalk. A decrease in the percentage of required transparency may be permitted by the Board if:

        1. There is a design constraint, such as permanent wainscoting, and removal or alteration would detract from the structural or architectural integrity of the building; or
        2. The existing layout of the building or other physical constraints such as the placement of load bearing walls or columns creates a hardship. If transparency requirements are reduced, wall murals, landscaping, colored awnings, display cases, or other means appropriate to the setting shall be provided to create visual interest.
    5. Awnings. Awnings shall be functional, serving as weather protection for pedestrians at street level. Awnings over sidewalks shall overhang the sidewalk a minimum of five feet. All awnings shall be of a design compatible with the architecture of the area.
3. Exterior Building Design Outside the Asian Design Character District. Outside the Asian Design Character District, earthen colors and masonry construction with nonmetallic surfaces are preferred. Concrete construction will also be permitted if treated in a manner or incorporated into a design that provides visual interest and avoids large unbroken surface areas.

### Chapter 23.69 - MAJOR INSTITUTION OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sections:

#### Subchapter I - Establishment of Overlay District
##### 23.69.002 - Purpose and intent.

The purpose of this chapter is to regulate Seattle's major educational and medical institutions in order to:


1. Permit appropriate institutional growth within boundaries while minimizing the adverse impacts associated with development and geographic expansion;
2. Balance a Major Institution's ability to change and the public benefit derived from change with the need to protect the livability and vitality of adjacent neighborhoods;
3. Encourage the concentration of Major Institution development on existing campuses, or alternatively, the decentralization of such uses to locations more than two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet from campus boundaries;
4. Provide for the coordinated growth of major institutions through major institution conceptual master plans and the establishment of major institutions overlay zones;
5. Discourage the expansion of established major institution boundaries;
6. Encourage significant community involvement in the development, monitoring, implementation and amendment of major institution master plans, including the establishment of citizen's advisory committees containing community and major institution representatives;
7. Locate new institutions in areas where such activities are compatible with the surrounding land uses and where the impacts associated with existing and future development can be appropriately mitigated;
8. Accommodate the changing needs of major institutions, provide flexibility for development and encourage a high quality environment through modifications of use restrictions and parking requirements of the underlying zoning;
9. Make the need for appropriate transition primary considerations in determining setbacks. Also setbacks may be appropriate to achieve proper scale, building modulation, or view corridors;
10. Allow an increase to the number of permitted parking spaces only when it is 1) necessary to reduce parking demand on streets in surrounding areas, and 2) compatible with goals to minimize traffic congestion in the area;
11. Use the TMP to reduce the number of vehicle trips to the major institution, minimize the adverse impacts of traffic on the streets surrounding the institution, minimize demand for parking on nearby streets, especially residential streets, and minimize the adverse impacts of institution-related parking on nearby streets. To meet these objectives, seek to reduce the number of SOVs used by employees and students at peak time and destined for the campus;
12. Through the master plan: 1) give clear guidelines and development standards on which the major institutions can rely for long-term planning and development; 2) provide the neighborhood advance notice of the development plans of the major institution; 3) allow the city to anticipate and plan for public capital or programmatic actions that will be needed to accommodate development; and 4) provide the basis for determining appropriate mitigating actions to avoid or reduce adverse impacts from major institution growth; and
13. Encourage the preservation, restoration and reuse of designated historic buildings.

##### 23.69.004 - Major Institution Overlay District established.

There is hereby established pursuant to Chapter 23.59 of the Seattle Municipal Code, the Major Institution Overlay District, which shall overlay each Major Institution designated according to the provisions of Section 23.69.024.

    1. Within five (5) weeks of the publication of the final master plan and EIS, the Director shall prepare a draft report on the application for a master plan as provided in Section 23.76.050, Report of the Director.
    2. In the Director's Report, a determination shall be made whether the planned development and changes of the Major Institution are consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter, and represent a reasonable balance of the public benefits of development and change with the need to maintain livability and vitality of adjacent neighborhoods. Consideration shall be given to:

        1. The reasons for institutional growth and change, the public benefits resulting from the planned new facilities and services, and the way in which the proposed development will serve the public purpose mission of the major institution; and
        2. The extent to which the growth and change will significantly harm the livability and vitality of the surrounding neighborhood.
    3. In the Director's Report, an assessment shall be made of the extent to which the Major Institution, with its proposed development and changes, will address the goals and applicable policies under Education and Employability and Health in the Human Development Element of the Comprehensive Plan.
    4. The Director's analysis and recommendation on the proposed master plan's development program component shall consider the following:

        1. The extent to which the Major Institution proposes to lease space or otherwise locate a use at street level in a commercial zone outside of, but within two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of, the MIO District boundary that is not similar to a personal and household retail sales and service use, eating and drinking establishment, customer service office, entertainment use or child care center but is allowed in the zone. To approve such proposal, the Director shall consider the criteria in Section 23.69.035 D3;
        2. The extent to which proposed development is phased in a manner which minimizes adverse impacts on the surrounding area. When public improvements are anticipated in the vicinity of proposed Major Institution development or expansion, coordination between the Major Institution development schedule and timing of public improvements shall be required;
        3. The extent to which historic structures which are designated on any federal, state or local historic or landmark register are proposed to be restored or reused. Any changes to designated Seattle Landmarks shall comply with the requirements of the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance. The Major Institution's Advisory Committee shall review any application to demolish a designated Seattle Landmark and shall submit comments to the Landmarks Preservation Board before any certificate of approval is issued;
        4. The extent to which the proposed density of Major Institution development will affect vehicular and pedestrian circulation, adequacy of public facilities, capacity of public infrastructure, and amount of open space provided;
        5. The extent to which the limit on the number of total parking spaces allowed will minimize the impacts of vehicular circulation, traffic volumes and parking in the area surrounding the MIO District.
    5. The Director's analysis and recommendation on the proposed master plan's development standards component shall be based on the following:

        1. The extent to which buffers such as topographic features, freeways or large open spaces are present or transitional height limits are proposed to mitigate the difference between the height and scale of existing or proposed Major Institution development and that of adjoining areas. Transition may also be achieved through the provision of increased setbacks, articulation of structure facades, limits on structure height or bulk or increased spacing between structures;
        2. The extent to which any structure is permitted to achieve the height limit of the MIO District. The Director shall evaluate the specified limits on structure height in relationship to the amount of MIO District area permitted to be covered by structures, the impact of shadows on surrounding properties, the need for transition between the Major Institution and the surrounding area, and the need to protect views;
        3. The extent to which setbacks of Major Institution development at ground level or upper levels of a structure from the boundary of the MIO District or along public rights-of-way are provided for and the extent to which these setbacks provide a transition between Major Institution development and development in adjoining areas;
        4. The extent to which allowable lot coverage is consistent with permitted density and allows for adequate setbacks along public rights-of-way or boundaries of the MIO District. Coverage limits should insure that view corridors through Major Institution development are enhanced and that area for landscaping and open space is adequate to minimize the impact of Major Institution development within the MIO District and on the surrounding area;
        5. The extent to which landscaping standards have been incorporated for required setbacks, for open space, along public rights-of-way, and for surface parking areas. Landscaping shall meet or exceed the amount of landscaping required by the underlying zoning. Trees shall be required along all public rights-of-way where feasible;
        6. The extent to which access to planned parking, loading and service areas is provided from an arterial street;
        7. The extent to which the provisions for pedestrian circulation maximize connections between public pedestrian rights-of-way within and adjoining the MIO District in a convenient manner. Pedestrian connections between neighborhoods separated by Major Institution development shall be emphasized and enhanced;
        8. The extent to which designated open space maintains the patterns and character of the area in which the Major Institution is located and is desirable in location and access for use by patients, students, visitors and staff of the Major Institution;
        9. The extent to which designated open space, though not required to be physically accessible to the public, is visually accessible to the public;
        10. The extent to which the proposed development standards provide for the protection of scenic views and/or views of landmark structures. Scenic views and/or views of landmark structures along existing public rights-of-way or those proposed for vacation may be preserved. New view corridors shall be considered where potential enhancement of views through the Major Institution or of scenic amenities may be enhanced. To maintain or provide for view corridors the Director may require, but not be limited to, the alternate spacing or placement of planned structures or grade-level openings in planned structures. The institution shall not be required to reduce the combined gross floor area for the MIO District in order to protect views other than those protected under City laws of general applicability.
    6. The Director's report shall specify all measures or actions necessary to be taken by the Major Institution to mitigate adverse impacts of Major Institution development that are specified in the proposed master plan.

In making the determination whether the amendment is minor, the Director shall consider the following factors:

        1. Whether an adequate supply of commercially zoned land for business serving neighborhood residents will continue to exist, and
        2. Whether the use will maintain or enhance the viability or long term potential of the neighborhood-serving character of the area, and
        3. Whether the use will displace existing neighborhood-serving commercial uses at street level or disrupt a continuous commercial street front, particularly of personal and household retail sales and service uses, and
        4. Whether the use supports neighborhood planning goals and objectives as provided in a Council-approved neighborhood plan.
5. Major Amendments. A proposed change to an adopted master plan shall be considered a major amendment when it is not an exempt change according to subsection B of this section or a minor amendment according to subsection D of this section. In addition, any of the following shall be considered a major amendment:

    1. An increase in a height designation or the expansion of the boundary of the MIO District; or
    2. Any change to a development standard that is less restrictive; or
    3. A reduction in housing stock outside the boundary but within two thousand five hundred feet (2,500') of the MIO District, other than within a Downtown zone, that exceeds the level approved in an adopted master plan; or
    4. A change to the single-occupancy vehicle goal of an approved transportation management program that increases the percentage of people traveling by single-occupancy vehicle; or
    5. A use that requires Council Conditional Use approval, including but not limited to a helistop or a major communication utility, that was not described in an adopted master plan; or
    6. The update of an entire development program component of a master plan that was adopted under Code provisions prior to the 1996 Major Institutions Ordinance where the institution proposes an increase to the total amount of gross floor area allowed or the total number of parking spaces allowed under the institution's existing development program component within the MIO District.
6. If the Director, after reviewing any Advisory Committee recommendation, determines that a proposed major amendment is of unusual complexity or size, the Director may require that the institution prepare a new master plan subject to Section 23.69.032.
7. If an amendment is determined to be major, the amendment and environmental review process shall be subject to the provisions of Section 23.69.032, Master plan process. However, a concept plan and preliminary draft plan shall not be required. Instead, the Major Institution shall submit a major amendment draft report as part of the application stating which parts of the master plan are proposed to be amended. If an EIS is required for the major amendment, the draft EIS shall be prepared after submittal of the major amendment draft report. After comments are received on the major amendment draft report, the institution shall prepare the major amendment final report and if required, the final EIS. If an EIS is not required for the major amendment, the Director is not required to hold a public hearing on the major amendment draft report.
8. Noncontiguous areas that are included in a MIO District as a result of a previously adopted master plan shall be deleted from the MIO District at the time a major amendment is approved unless the noncontiguous area was a former and separate MIO District. The change to the MIO District boundaries shall be in accordance with the procedures for City-initiated amendments to the Official Land Use Map as provided in Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, and shall not be subject to the rezone criteria contained in Section 23.34.124.

        7. Parks and open spaces.
    2. A minimum of eighty (80) percent of each structure fronting on a major pedestrian street must be occupied at street level by required street-level uses or a building lobby permitting access to uses above or behind street-front uses. In no case may pedestrian access to uses above or behind required street-front uses exceed twenty (20) percent of the structure's major pedestrian street front. The remaining twenty (20) percent of the structure's street frontage may contain other permitted uses or pedestrian entrances (Exhibit 23.71.008 A).
    3. Street-level uses must occupy a minimum of the first ten (10) feet above sidewalk grade.
    4. All required street-level uses along major pedestrian streets may be set back no more than ten (10) feet from the street lot line, except as necessary to provide open space as defined in Section 23.71.014 C or for bedrooms in a lodging structure, which may be set back a maximum of fifteen (15) feet. The owner shall design the area subject to this setback to include special pavers, as an extension of the sidewalk or with landscaping.
    5. The principal entrances to required street-level uses on major pedestrian streets shall have direct access to the sidewalk and be within three (3) feet of the sidewalk grade elevation.
    6. General sales and service uses or major durables retail sales uses, in each case greater than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet may locate a principal pedestrian entrance on a facade oriented to a parking area or the major pedestrian street. Where a principal pedestrian entrance is oriented to a parking area, an additional pedestrian entrance shall be located along the major pedestrian street. In lieu of the additional entrance, the owner may provide a ten (10) foot wide, landscaped pedestrian walkway from the major pedestrian street to the principal pedestrian entrance, provided that the walkway does not go through other businesses or parking areas.

    1. For purposes of measuring attainment of single-occupant vehicle (SOV) goals contained in the TMP, the proportion of SOV trips shall be calculated for the p.m. hour in which an applicant expects the largest number of vehicle trips to be made by employees and students at the site (the p.m. peak hour of the generator). The proportion of SOV trips shall be calculated by dividing the total number of employees and students using an SOV to make a trip during the expected peak hour by the total number of employee and student person trips during the expected peak hour.
    2. Compliance with this section does not supplant the responsibility of any employer to comply with Seattle's Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) Ordinance.
2. The owner of any site who proposes multifamily substantial development which is expected to generate 50 or more vehicle trips in any one p.m. hour shall prepare and implement a TMP. The TMP shall be consistent with requirements for TMPs in Director's Rule 10-2012 or its successor. For purposes of measuring attainment of the SOV goal, the proportion of SOV trips shall be calculated for the p.m. hour in which an applicant expects the largest number of vehicle trips to be made by residents of the site (the p.m. peak hour of the generator). The proportion of SOV trips shall be calculated by dividing the total number of residential trips made by SOV during the expected peak hour by the total number of residential person trips.
3. Each owner subject to the requirements of this section shall prepare a TMP as described in rules promulgated by the Director, as part of the requirements for obtaining a master use permit.
4. The TMP shall be approved by the Director if, after consulting with Seattle Department of Transportation, the Director determines that the TMP measures are likely to achieve the SOV goals.
5. The owner of each property subject to this implementation guideline shall submit an annual progress report to the Director of Transportation, who will advise the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections on compliance. The progress report shall contain:

    1. The number of full and part-time employees, students and/or residents at a site during the peak hour;
    2. A summary of the total p.m. peak hour vehicle trips generated by the site, including employees, students, and residents;
    3. A description of any programs, incentives, or activities or other measures targeted to reduce vehicle trips, in which employees, students, or residents at the site participate;
    4. The number of people participating in the TMP measures;
    5. The peak hour proportion of SOV trips of the employees, students, and/or residents.
6. Seattle Department of Transportation shall monitor compliance with the requirements of this section. If monitoring shows that the owner has not implemented the TMP measures or has not made sufficient progress toward achieving the TMP goals, the Director of Transportation may recommend that the Director:

    1. Require modifications to the TMP program measures; and/or
    2. Pursue enforcement action pursuant to the Land Use Code.
7. After approval of a TMP and issuance of a master use permit as prescribed in subsections C and D of this section, if the owner applies for a master use permit for additional development, before approving the new master use permit, the Director, after consulting with the Director of Transportation, shall review the implementation of the TMP. If substantial progress has not been made in achieving the goal for the proportion of SOV trips, the Director may:

    1. Require the applicant to revise the TMP to include additional measures in order to achieve compliance with the TMP goal before the issuance of a permit; and/or
    2. Require measures in addition to those in the TMP that encourage alternative means of transportation for the proposed new development; and/or
    3. Deny the permit if the Director determines that the owner has failed to make a good-faith effort to implement the TMP; or
    4. Determine that a revised or new program is not needed, and that the permit can be issued without changes to the existing TMP.
8. Compliance. To comply with this section, the owner of a site subject to the requirement for a TMP, must demonstrate that he or she has an approved TMP, has submitted the required annual reports, and has succeeded in accomplishing one (1) of the two (2) following objectives:

    1. That the owner has implemented the measures contained in the TMP for the development project; and/or
    2. That the owner has met the goal for SOV trips specified in subsection A of this section. Failure to comply with the provisions of this section is a violation of the Land Use Code. The penalty for each violation is Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) per day.
9. A fund shall be established in the City's General Fund to receive revenue from fines for violations of this section. Revenue from fines shall be allocated to activities or incentives to reduce vehicle trips in the Northgate area. The Director of Transportation shall recommend to the Mayor and City Council how these funds should be allocated.
10. Seattle Department of Transportation and the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall prepare a Director's Rule explaining how each department shall implement this Section 23.71.018.

##### 23.71.020 - Development Agreements.

Development Agreements may be proposed for development within the Northgate Overlay District pursuant to RCW 36.70B. In determining whether to approve a Development Agreement, the City Council shall consider the extent to which the proposed development or redevelopment:


1. Contributes toward meeting the Northgate Urban Center housing targets;
2. Coordinates approaches to transportation planning and traffic analysis with surrounding properties and the City, with the goal of reducing use of single-occupant vehicles and reducing or minimizing pedestrian and vehicular conflicts and other potential negative traffic impacts on neighborhoods;

The commercial space requirement of subsection 23.73.008.B.1 applies to the total size of a business establishment, except that if a business establishment includes more than one principal use, each principal use within the business establishment may qualify as a small business establishment.
    3. For projects that retain a character structure as provided in Section 23.73.015, in addition to any excluded floor area specified in subsection 23.73.008.B.1, floor area meeting the following conditions is not required to comply with subsection 23.73.008.B.1:

        1. The floor area is occupied by street-level commercial uses or other uses excluded from the requirement for small commercial spaces in subsection 23.73.008.B.1 and is within the original street-level footprint of the retained character structure; and
        2. The original street-level of the character structure was designed as a large space for use as automobile retail sales and service, warehouse, manufacturing, or large retail or commercial space.
3. Within new structures that face Pike, East Pike, Pine, and East Pine Streets, the length of street frontage permitted at street level for an individual business, excluding institutional uses, is limited to 50 feet. Portions of a business that are separated from the street by another business or a different use that provides separate pedestrian access to the street are not limited in width. The limit on the street frontage of an individual business does not apply to uses in an existing character structure or in a character structure retained in a project according to Section 23.73.015, provided that the original street-level of the character structure was designed as a large space for use as automobile retail sales and service, warehouse, manufacturing, or large retail or commercial space.

##### 23.73.010 - Floor area limits outside the Conservation Core

![23-73-010.png](./images/23-73-010.png)


Map A for: Conservation Core


1. Floor area limit. The following provisions apply to lots located outside the boundaries of the Conservation Core identified on Map A for 23.73.010.

    1. The maximum gross floor area of any single story above 35 feet in height is limited to 15,000 square feet, except as provided in subsections 23.73.010.A.2, 23.73.010.A.3, 23.73.010.B, and 23,73.010.C.
    2. For a project that is allowed extra height above the height limit by subsection 23.73.014.A, the 35-foot height above which the floor area limit applies is increased to 39 feet, provided that the provisions for allowing additional height under subsection 23.73.014.A are met.
    3. For a project that is allowed extra height above the height limit by subsection 23.73.014.B, the 35-foot height above which the floor area limit applies is increased to 39 feet, provided that:

        1. The provisions for allowing additional height under subsection 23.73.014.B are met, and
        2. The minimum floor-to-ceiling height of non-residential uses at street level is at least 13 feet, except that if a character structure is retained according to Section 23.73.015, the floor-to-ceiling height of the portion of the street-level story above the footprint of the character structure need not exceed the original floor-to-ceiling height of the character structure.
    4. On a lot with more than one structure or more than one portion of the same structure that exceeds 35 feet in height, the floor area limit applies to the combined portions of each story above 35 feet in height. If 39 feet is the height above which the floor area limit applies as allowed by subsection 23.73.010.A.1 and subsection 23.73.010.A.2, then the floor area limit applies to the combined portions of each story above 39 feet.
    5. If new structures on the same or abutting lots have internal connections above or below grade, each of the stories of the connected structures are considered to be a single story for the purpose of calculating the floor area subject to the floor area limit.
2. Exceptions to floor area limit

    1. A 15 percent increase in the floor area limit is permitted for projects that meet the following conditions:

        1. The project retains all the character structures existing on the lot, unless a departure is approved through the design review process to allow the removal of a character structure based on the provisions of subsection 23.41.012.B.32; and
        2. The project includes uses that contribute to the area's recognized character as an arts district, including performing arts space or artist-studio dwellings that typically have design requirements such as nonstandard floor-to-ceiling heights that reduce the total amount of usable floor area in a structure; or
        3. A minimum of 50 percent of the total gross floor area of the project is housing that is affordable to and occupied by "income-eligible households," as defined in Section 23.58A.004, and is subject to recorded covenants approved by the Director that ensure that the housing remains available to these households for a minimum of 50 years; or
        4. Through the design review process a determination is made that including one or more of the following features offsets the increase in the bulk of the project and allows for a design treatment that achieves the intent of the neighborhood design guidelines better than adhering to the floor area limit that would apply without the exception:

            1. A landscaped courtyard that is visible from the sidewalk and located primarily at street level on a street that is not a principal pedestrian street;
            2. A through-block pedestrian corridor that connects parallel streets bounding the project, consistent with the neighborhood design guidelines; or
            3. Open space at locations that support the gateway and open space concepts promoted in the neighborhood design guidelines.
    2. Retaining character structures on a lot. A 25 percent increase in the floor area limit established in subsection 23.73.010.A is permitted for a project that retains all the character structures on the same lot according to the provisions in Section 23.73.015, unless a departure is approved through the design review process to allow the removal of a character structure based on the provisions of subsection 23.41.012.B.32. Any increase in floor area permitted according to this subsection 23.73.010.B.2 shall not be combined with any other increase in floor area permitted according to subsection 23.73.010.B.1 or 23.73.010.B.3.
    3. A 25 percent increase in the floor area limit is permitted on a lot that qualifies as a receiving site for a project that adds floor area through the use of TDP as permitted by Section 23.73.024, provided that the amount of floor area added through the use of TDP is equivalent to at least 0.25 FAR, as calculated for the receiving site. Any increase in floor area permitted according to this subsection 23.73.010.B.3 shall not be combined with any other increase in floor area permitted according to subsection 23.73.010.B.1 or 23.73.010.B.2.
3. Exempt floor area. The following is not included in calculating floor area subject to the floor area limit:

    1. Floor area within an existing character structure either on the lot or an abutting lot within the same development site if the entire character structure is retained according to the provisions of subsection 23.73.024.C.4.
    2. For a project that retains an entire character structure on the lot according to the requirements of subsection 23.73.024.C.4, any floor area in a portion of the new structure that extends or cantilevers over the character structure; provided that the new structure does not alter the envelope or interior of the character structure. Connections between the new structure and the facades of the retained character structure that do not face a public street are allowed.

Outside the Conservation Core identified on Map A for 23.73.010, for all portions of a structure that abut Pike, East Pike, Pine, or East Pine Streets, structure width shall be limited to 50 percent of the total width of all lots on the block face, measured along the street lot line, on block faces that exceed 170 feet in width, except that the structure width limit calculation does not include the following:

    1. Portions of a character structure that are retained according to the provisions in Section 23.73.015, whether connected to a new structure or not;
    2. Portions of a new structure that are separated from the street lot line by another lot;
    3. Portions of a new structure that are separated from the street lot line by an adjacent structure located on the same lot that is not a character structure, provided that the adjacent structures are not internally connected above or below grade; and
    4. Portions of a new structure that are separated from the street lot line by a character structure that is retained according to the provisions of Section 23.73.015.
2. Structure width and depth limits inside the Conservation Core. The structure width and depth limits in this subsection 23.73.012.B apply to lots that are located inside the Conservation Core identified on Map A for 23.73.010, except that there are no limits on width and depth for lots that did not contain a character structure on January 18, 2012.

    1. 128 feet shall be the width and the depth limit for portions of new structures on lots that contained a character structure on January 18, 2012. The width limit is measured as the combined width of all portions of new structures located on the lot and the depth limit is measured as the combined depth of all portions of new structures located on the lot, except as provided in subsection 23.73.012.B.2 and subsection 23.73.012.B.3.
    2. Portions of a new structure that are separated from the street lot line by a character structure that is retained according to Section 23.73.015 are excluded from structure width and depth measurements, provided that:

        1. All character structures on the lot are retained according to the provisions of Section 23.73.015, unless a departure is approved through the design review process to allow the removal of a character structure based on the provisions of subsection 23.41.012.B.32; and
        2. This exclusion from width and depth measurement in subsection 23.73.012.B.2 is only allowed for one retained character structure on the lot.
    3. For the narrow block bounded by Broadway, East Union Street, Broadway Court, and East Madison Street, the depth limit does not apply to structures on through lots extending from Broadway to Broadway Court, and the width limit only applies to frontages on Broadway and Broadway Court.

##### 23.73.014 - Height exceptions

1. Height exception for street-level uses. In zones with a mapped height limit of 65 feet, an additional 4 feet of height above the height limit of the zone is allowed for structures that include uses listed as required street-level uses in subsection 23.47A.005.D.1 or live-work use if the following conditions are met:

    1. The floor-to-ceiling height of the street-level uses or live-work units located at street level is 13 feet or more, except when a character structure is retained according to Section 23.73.015, the floor-to-ceiling height of the portion of the street-level story above the footprint of the character structure need not exceed the original floor-to-ceiling height of the character structure;
    2. The additional height will not permit an additional story to be built beyond the number that could be built under a 65-foot height limit; and
    3. The transparency requirements for street-facing facades in subsection 23.47A.008.A.2 are met for the portion of the street-facing facades between 2 feet and 12 feet above the sidewalk. Only clear or lightly-tinted glass shall be considered transparent. For a character structure that is retained in a new project according to Section 23.73.015, measurement for required transparency of the street-facing facades of the character structure shall be according to the provisions of subsection 23.86.026.B.
2. Height exception for lots that include a character structure. In zones with a 65-foot mapped height limit, or with a 40-foot mapped height limit with provisions allowing for additional height up to 65 feet according to subsection 23.47A.012.A, 10 feet of additional height is allowed above the 65 foot height limit if the following requirements are met:

    1. The lot includes a character structure and all character structures on the lot are retained according to the provisions of Section 23.73.015, unless a departure is approved through the design review process to allow removal of a character structure based on the provisions of subsection 23.41.012.B.32.
    2. The additional floor area above the 65-foot height limit is occupied solely by residential use, except as otherwise permitted by subsection 23.73.014.B.3;
    3. A project that is permitted the FAR of the underlying zone for non-residential uses under subsection 23.73.009.B may be allowed to occupy the floor area permitted above the 65 foot height limit under this subsection 23.73.014.B if a departure is approved through the design review process, provided that there is no additional increase in the FAR for non-residential uses beyond what is otherwise allowed by Section 23.73.009. The decision to allow a departure shall be based on a determination that the additional height will result in a better design treatment and accommodate features that promote the development objectives of the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District by:

        1. Maintaining greater portions of existing character structures on the lot through design treatments that exceed the minimum standards of subsection 23.73.015.A, retaining an entire character structure, or retaining a large number of character structures if the number and siting of the structures pose severe limitations on the amount of floor area that can be achieved in the new project within the applicable height limit; or
        2. Providing space for features that enhance pedestrian circulation and walkability in the area, such as though-block pedestrian corridors, or open spaces at locations that support the gateway and open space concepts promoted in the neighborhood design guidelines; or
        3. Accommodating uses, such as theater space or arts facilities that support the area's arts and culture function but that may have special spatial needs that require additional design flexibility to incorporate them into the project, provided the uses are maintained for the life of the project as provided for in a recorded covenant approved by the Director.
3. Height exception for character structure TDP receiving sites. A height exception for character structure TDP receiving sites is allowed according to subsection 23.73.024.B.
4. If a project uses more than one of the height exceptions permitted by this Section 23.73.014, the maximum height shall be the height permitted by the exception allowing the greatest height increase.
5. Additional height for rooftop features. For structures using the height exceptions specified in this Section 23.73.014, additional height is permitted above the maximum height allowed by the exception to accommodate rooftop features as permitted under subsection 23.47A.012.C.

##### 23.73.015 - Retention and demolition of character structures

1. For provisions in this Chapter 23.73 that require a portion of a character structure to be retained in order to earn incentives, in addition to the provisions of the applicable section, the minimum requirements for retaining a character structure are as follows:

    1. All street-facing facades of the character structure shall be maintained for the life of the project;
    2. All portions of the new structure above the height of the street-facing facades of the character structure shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from the street-facing facades of the character structure, except:

        1. Projections such as unenclosed balconies, bay windows, cornices, belt courses; and eaves, gutters, and other forms of weather protection may project a maximum of 18 inches into the required setback; and
        2. On through lots that are bounded on three or more sides by a street and that are less than 170 feet wide measured between streets, a setback is not required from the narrowest abutting street that is not shown as a Principal Pedestrian Street on Map A for 23.73.008.
    3. The original floor-to-ceiling height of the street-level story of the character structure is maintained, allowing for adjustments to provide access to persons with disabilities.
    4. If it is determined at any time that the character structure's street-facing facade cannot be maintained as required under subsection 23.73.015.A.1, the Design Review Board shall review any proposed changes to the facade before changes are made. If the proposed facade changes are not approved through the design review process the incentives may not be used.
2. Character structures that are retained as provided by this Section 23.73.015 shall be maintained as approved by the Master Use Permit for the project for the life of the project in a manner that complies with applicable codes and approved plans, including the approved plan required by subsection 23.73.015.C.
3. The applicant, as part of the Master Use Permit application submittal, shall submit the following:

    1. A plan specifying the portions of the character structure to be retained, demolished, or rebuilt. For portions of the structure to be retained, the plan shall clearly indicate: the materials to be retained in place, salvaged for reconstruction, or otherwise modified, and new materials to be used in any reconstruction; and
    2. A representation of the structure's final appearance.
4. A demolition permit may only be approved for portions of the project that are specified for demolition in the plan submitted with the Master Use Permit application.
5. For the purposes of applying any applicable street-level developments standards of Section 23.47A.008, the portion of a character structure that is retained to meet the standards of subsection 23.73.015.A shall be regarded as an existing structure.
6. Departure from standards for retaining portions of a character structure. For a project that retains portions of a character structure, departures from the provisions in subsection 23.73.015.A may be granted through the design review process, provided that one or more of the following conditions apply:

    1. The departure will allow for design treatments that reduce the appearance of the bulk of the new structure and enhance the relationship between the new structure and the retained character structure on the lot or development on adjacent lots; or
    2. The portions of the new structure will not obscure key elements of the retained structure's architectural character; or
    3. The departure will facilitate the retention of other character structures on the lot; or
    4. Additional flexibility is necessary to maintain a character structure on a development lot that is constrained by size or configuration; or
    5. The departure will allow for a more functional street-level plan and improved pedestrian access while retaining key qualities of the street-level story of the character structure, especially as perceived from the street.
7. Demolition of character structures. If a project is required to retain all the character structures on a lot under the provisions of this Chapter 23.73, a character structure may nevertheless be demolished through a departure approved by the design review process according to the provisions of subsection 23.41.012.B.32.

##### 23.73.016 - Amenity area

1. Amenity area is not required for structures existing as of April 1, 2000 that are repaired, renovated, or structurally altered to the extent permitted by the development standards of the Land Use Code, provided that street-facing facades are retained and 50 percent or more of the gross floor area is retained.
2. Amenity area is not required for new construction of affordable housing that meets the following:

    1. At least 40 percent of the units are rented to households at annual rents not exceeding 30 percent of 60 percent of the median income; and
    2. The applicant demonstrates compliance with these income criteria for the life of the building.

##### 23.73.018 - Location of Parking

Parking provided as accessory parking for any permitted use may be located on the lot, or built into or under the structure, or located on a lot other than the lot on which the use is located except that parking is not permitted on a lot other than the lot where the use is located if providing the parking would result in the partial or total demolition of a character structure.


##### 23.73.024 - Transfer of development potential

1. General standards for the transfer of development potential (TDP) within the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District.

    1. For a lot located in an NC3P-65 zone within the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District shown on Map A for 23.73.004, an applicant may use TDP to obtain any of the following:

        1. A floor area exemption for residential and live-work unit floor area, as permitted under subsection 23.73.009.C.3 ;
        2. A height exception to allow an additional 10 feet above the 65-foot height limit; and
        3. A 25 percent increase in the floor area limit as provided in subsection 23.73.010.B.3.
    2. Within the Conservation Core shown on Map A for 23.73.010, a lot that is an eligible sending site meeting the provisions of subsection 23.73.024.C may transfer development potential to any lot that is an eligible receiving site meeting the provisions of subsection 23.73.024.B. Eligible receiving sites may only gain development potential from eligible sending sites that are also located within the Conservation Core.
    3. Development potential may not be transferred from one lot to another except as allowed by this Chapter 23.73.
    4. Development potential may be transferred from eligible sending sites meeting the provisions of subsection 23.73.024.C to locations outside the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District if TDP transfer to specifically identified areas or lots is authorized by City ordinance.
2. Standards for character structure TDP receiving sites. A lot must meet the following conditions in order to be eligible to achieve extra residential floor area through TDP:

    1. TDP receiving sites shall be located in an NC3P-65 zone within the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District, provided that:

        1. Development of the receiving site shall not result in the demolition of a structure designated as a landmark according to Chapter 25.12 or its alteration in a manner that is inconsistent with Chapter 25.12 or an ordinance imposing controls on the landmark structure.
        2. Development on the lot that is the receiving site shall not result in the demolition or significant alteration of a character structure that is not a designated landmark and that has existed on the site since January 18, 2012, unless a departure is approved through the design review process to allow the removal of a character structure based on the provisions of subsection 23.41.012.B.32. For the purposes of this subsection 23.73.024.B.1.b, significant alterations to a character structure would result in conditions that would preclude compliance with the minimum requirements of subsection 23.73.024.C.4.
    2. An additional 10 feet in height above the height limit of the zone is permitted on a lot that is an eligible TDP receiving site.
    3. Any residential and live-work floor area that is exempt from the FAR limit as allowed by subsection 23.73.009.C.3, or any floor area that exceeds the maximum floor area limit as allowed under subsection 23.73.010.B.3, or that is located above 65 feet in height shall be achieved through the use of TDP.
    4. Floor area gained through the use of TDP shall be for residential and live-work unit use only.
    5. For a structure that achieves an increase in height through the use of TDP, the minimum street level floor-to-ceiling height is 13 feet.
    6. TDP required before construction. No permit after the first building permit, and in any event no permit for construction activity other than excavating or shoring, and no permit for occupying existing floor area by any use based on TDP; will be issued for development that includes TDP until the applicant has demonstrated possession of TDP to the Director's satisfaction.
3. Standards for sending sites. A lot must meet the following conditions in order to be eligible as a sending site to transfer extra residential floor area through TDP to a lot that is an eligible receiving site according to subsection 23.73.024.B:

    1. TDP sending sites shall be located in an NC3P zone within the Pike/Pine Conservation Overlay District, excluding NC3P zones with an MIO-105 overlay, and shall contain one of the following structures:

        1. One or more structures designated wholly or in part as a landmark under Chapter 25.12 or its predecessor ordinance; or
        2. Any character structure, provided that character structures on the proposed TDP sending site have not been demolished or significantly altered since January 18, 2012, unless a departure is approved through the design review process to allow the removal of a character structure based on the provisions of subsection 23.41.012.B.32. For the purposes of this subsection 23.73.024.C.1.b, a significant alteration results in conditions that would preclude the character structure from complying with the minimum requirements for retaining the character structure in subsection 23.73.024.C.4.
    2. Maximum transferable floor area

        1. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible sending site with a character structure that is not a designated landmark is the product of: the eligible lot area of the sending site, times the maximum FAR for structures containing both residential and non-residential uses as prescribed in Section 23.47A.013, minus the sum of any chargeable gross floor area on the sending site under the zoning in effect at the time a complete application transferring TDP is accepted, and minus any TDP previously transferred from the sending site.
        2. The maximum amount of floor area that may be transferred from an eligible sending site with a designated landmark is the amount calculated in subsection 23.73.024.C.2.a multiplied by two.
        3. For purposes of this subsection 23.73.024.C.2, the eligible sending site lot area is the total area of the lot where the character structure was originally built.
    3. Rehabilitation and maintenance of character structures. Character structures that are designated landmark structures on sending lots from which TDP is transferred shall be rehabilitated and maintained as required by the Landmarks Preservation Board. Character structures located on a lot that is a TDP sending site that are not designated landmark structures shall be rehabilitated and maintained to comply with applicable codes and shall remain in compliance with the provisions of subsection 23.73.024.C.4 for the life of the structure on the receiving site that includes the additional gross floor area. If the TDP is proposed to be transferred prior to completing rehabilitation work necessary to satisfy this subsection 23.73.024.C, the Director may require as a condition of the transfer that a security be deposited with the City in an amount determined by the Director to ensure that the work is completed.
    4. For character structures that are not designated landmark structures, the following provisions for retaining the character structure shall apply:

        1. All exterior facades are retained; except that portions of a new structure may abut facades that are not street-facing facades, and connections between the new structure and the facades of the retained character structure that do not face a public street are allowed; and
        2. The original floor area of the character structure is maintained, except that additions or alterations that extend the useful physical life or economic viability of the structure are permitted, provided that:

            1. The additions do not significantly damage or destroy the structural system of the character structure or fundamentally alter historic characteristics of its exterior appearance; and
            2. The total floor area of any additions, excluding floor area added to reclaim floor area that may have been removed from the original structure over time, does not exceed the equivalent of 0.5 FAR, as calculated on the lot where the structure was originally built.
4. TDP deeds and agreements

    1. The fee owners of the TDP sending site shall execute a deed, and shall obtain the release of the TDP from all liens of record and the written consent of all holders of encumbrances on the sending lot other than easements and restrictions, unless the requirement for a release or consent is waived by the Director for good cause. The deed shall be recorded in the King County real property records. If TDP is conveyed to the owner of a TDP receiving site described in the deed, then unless otherwise expressly stated in the deed or any subsequent instrument conveying the lot or the TDP, the TDP shall pass with the receiving site whether or not a structure using the TDP shall have been permitted or built prior to any conveyance of the receiving site. Any subsequent conveyance of TDP previously conveyed to a receiving site shall require the written consent of all parties holding any interest in or lien on the receiving site from which the conveyance is made. If the TDP is transferred other than directly from the sending site to the receiving site using the TDP; then after the initial transfer all subsequent transfers shall also be by deed, duly executed, acknowledged, and recorded, each deed referring by King County recording number to the prior deed.
    2. Any person may purchase TDP that is eligible for transfer by complying with this Section 23.73.024, whether or not the purchaser is a permit applicant to develop real property or the owner of potential receiving site. Any TDP purchaser, including any successor or assignee, may use TDP on a receiving site to the extent that using TDP is permitted under the Land Use Code provisions applicable at the time the project intended to use the TDP vests, according to Section 23.76.026. The Director may require, as a condition of processing any permit application using TDP, that the owner of the receiving site demonstrate that the TDP has been validly transferred of record to the receiving site, and that the receiving site owner has recorded in the real estate records a notice stating that a permit application using TDP has been filed and the TDP to be used on the receiving site is not available for retransfer.
    3. As a condition to the effective transfer of TDP from a designated landmark, except from a City-owned sending site, the fee owner of the sending site shall execute and record an agreement running with the land, in form and content acceptable to, and accepted in writing by, the Director of Neighborhoods; providing for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the historically-significant or other relevant features of the structure or structures on the lot and acknowledging the restrictions on future development resulting from the transfer. The Director may require evidence that each lien holder has effectively subordinated the lien to the terms of the agreement, and that any holders of interests in the property have agreed to its terms. To the extent that a landmark structure on the sending site, the presence of which is a condition to eligibility to transfer TDP under the provisions of the zone, requires restoration or rehabilitation for the long-term preservation of the structure or its historically or architecturally-significant features, the Director of Neighborhoods may require as a condition to acceptance of the necessary agreement that the owner of the sending site apply for and obtain a certificate of approval from the Landmarks Preservation Board for the necessary work, or post security satisfactory to the Director of Neighborhoods for the completing the restoration or rehabilitation.
5. Reservation in deed. Any TDP eligible for transfer may instead be reserved in the conveyance of title to an eligible sending site by the express terms of the deed or other instrument of conveyance reserving a specified amount of TDP, provided that an instrument acceptable to the Director is recorded binding the sending site to the terms and conditions for eligibility to send TDP under this Section 23.73.024. Any TDP so reserved shall be considered transferred from that site and later may be conveyed by deed without participation of the owner of the site.
6. Any agreement governing the use or development of the sending site shall provide that its covenants or conditions run with the land and shall be specifically enforceable by the City.
7. The eligibility of a sending site to transfer TDP and the amount transferable from a sending site, shall be determined as of the date of transfer from the sending site and shall not be affected by the date of any application, permit decision, or other action for any project seeking to use TDP.



### Chapter 23.74 - STADIUM TRANSITION AREA OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sections:

#### Subchapter I - Establishment of Overlay District
##### 23.74.002 - Purpose, intent and description of the overlay district—Rezone requirement—Rezone criteria.

1. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this chapter is to implement the City's Comprehensive Plan, including the neighborhood plan for the Greater Duwamish Manufacturing/Industrial Center, by establishing a Stadium Transition Area Overlay District for the area shown on Exhibit 23.74.004 A. The Stadium Transition Area centers on large sports facilities and allows uses complementary to them. It is intended to contribute to a safer pedestrian environment for those attending events and permits a mix of uses, supporting the pedestrian-oriented character of the area as well as the surrounding industrial zone, while minimizing conflicts with industrial uses. Within the overlay district, use provisions and development standards are designed to create a pedestrian connection with downtown; discourage encroachment on nearby industrial uses to the south; and create a pedestrian-friendly streetscape. Allowing a mix of uses, including office development, is intended to encourage redevelopment and to maintain the health and vibrancy of the area during times when the sports facilities are not in operation.
2. Relationship to Surrounding Activity of Areas Located Within the District. The District is an area where stadiums and similar major, regional attractions are located, in which transportation and other infrastructure can support additional development. It is an area surrounded by land with widely varying development patterns and land use characteristics including the mixed use urban development of south Downtown, Pioneer Square, the working waterfront, and the industrial area. The desired relationship of the Stadium Transition Area is with Pioneer Square and First Avenue, permitting strong pedestrian and transit links to the north. There should be well-defined edges between the pedestrian activity of the Stadium Transition Area and industrial activity surrounding it. The portion of Fourth Avenue South that is north of Royal Brougham and the main line railroad tracks create a strong edge to the east and should be the eastern boundary. South Holgate Street, the first major cross street to the south of Safeco Field, should be the southern boundary. Boundaries should not be shifted farther into the industrial area.
3. Rezones resulting in Boundary Changes to the Stadium Transition Overlay Area District. A rezone pursuant to Chapter 23.34 shall be required to change the established boundaries of the Stadium Transition Area Overlay District. A rezone shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions. Areas to be included within the District boundaries shall be compatible with the purpose and intent as stated in this section, and shall either be areas developed as major spectator sports facilities, or areas that meet the criteria for Industrial Commercial zoning and are along preferred pedestrian routes that can provide safe and attractive passage for pedestrians between the stadiums and retail areas and transit service.

##### 23.74.004 - Stadium Transition Area Overlay District established

There is established pursuant to Chapter 23.59 of the Seattle Municipal Code, the Stadium Transition Area Overlay District as shown on Map A of 23.74.004.

The owners of all lots that are subject to a limit, whether or not contiguous, and upon which no part of the limit has yet been used, may combine the lots for purposes of that limit pursuant to an allocation document approved by the Director, and may then allocate the limit among those lots as the owners may elect, subject to approval by the Director under this subsection 23.75.040.C.
    2. The Director shall approve an allocation document only if the Director determines, as a Type I decision, that the document is consistent with this Chapter 23.75 and provides for an allocation process that will specify the allocations of one or more limits consistent with this Chapter 23.75 in a manner that will maintain consistency with those limits and allow the Director to determine the validity of each allocation to be made. To facilitate administration of this Chapter 23.75, the Director may establish, by rule, procedural requirements for allocation documents and allocations under them, and may approve or disapprove provisions in allocation documents for limits or conditions on allocations or reallocations in addition to those required.
    3. Any amendment to an allocation document is effective only if signed by all owners of record of all property subject to the allocation document and only if the Director approves the allocation document as amended, as a Type I decision, based on a determination that it is consistent with the requirements for an allocation document and with allocations previously made.
    4. Unless initial allocations to each lot are specified in the allocation document, in order to establish the initial allocation to the first lot to which an allocation is made, the process must require written approval of the owners of all lots initially combined. In order to establish the initial allocation to each other lot, the written approval of the owners of all remaining lots combined for purposes of that limit is required as provided in subsection 23.75.040.D.3.
4. Allocations of limits.

    1. Unless all lots subject to a limit have been combined pursuant to subsection 23.75.040.C for purposes of a limit, each lot has an allocation of that limit in the same proportion as the lot area bears to the area of all lots subject to the limit, rounded down to the nearest integer, which may be zero. For purposes of this subsection 23.75.040.D.1, the area of every lot subject to a limit and the total area of all lots subject to the limit is determined as of the date when the first Master Use Permit application is submitted for the use of any part of the limit on any lot, so that the allocations of the limit to all lots are then fixed, subject to any reallocations under subsection 23.75.040.D.7.
    2. If lots are combined pursuant to subsection 23.75.040.C for purposes of a limit, then

        1. before any allocation is made to one of those lots pursuant to this Section 23.75.040, the combined lot has an undivided allocation of that limit equal to the entire limit; and
        2. as allocations to specific lots are made pursuant to this Section 23.75.040, the undivided allocation of that limit to the remaining combined lot is reduced by each amount so allocated.
    3. If, after a lot is combined with one or more other lots pursuant to subsection 23.75.040.C for the purposes of a limit, an allocation of that limit is made to the lot in accordance with subsection 23.75.040.D.5, then the lot has the allocation so approved, and is no longer part of a combined lot for purposes of that limit. The lot may remain eligible to receive additional allocations, transfer an unused portion of its allocation to other lots, or both, pursuant to the allocation document and subject to any applicable rules issued by the Director.
    4. When a specific lot has been made part of a combined lot and no allocation of the limit to the specific lot has been approved by the Director, no development of that lot requiring an allocable portion of that limit is permitted, except that if the combined lot is a single development site for purposes of an application, then the limit is for the combined lot as determined under subsection 23.75.040.D.2.
    5. Pursuant to processes established in an allocation document consistent with 23.75.140.C, the portion of a limit allocated to a lot shall be initially established, and may be modified, in a manner that maintains consistency with the limit, in each case effective upon approval of the allocation or reallocation by the Director, as a Type I decision. The Director shall approve the allocation or reallocation under processes established in an allocation document, provided that:

        1. the owners of the lots affected have provided written approval; and
        2. the Director determines that the proposed allocation or reallocation is consistent with this Chapter 23.75 and with any relevant applications then pending, and with requirements of form and procedure established by the Director, and that any special conditions in the allocation document, are satisfied.
    6. The allocation document may provide for reallocations among lots to which initial allocations have been made, with the written approval of the owners of the lots affected. A limit may not be reallocated in any manner that would create a nonconformity, or increase the extent of any nonconformity, based on established uses or structures, or based on any development for which a permit has been issued or is pending.
    7. If lot lines are modified or new lots are created, then except to the extent otherwise provided in an allocation document or pursuant to agreements among owners approved by the Director, each new or modified lot shall have a share of each of the total allocations previously applicable to all lots affected by the modification of lot lines or creation of the new lots, in the same proportion as the area of that lot bears to the area of all such lots, except that the allocation to any new or modified lot shall be adjusted to the extent required so as not to create a nonconformity, or increase the extent of any existing nonconformity. To the extent necessary to offset any disproportionate allocation required to avoid a nonconformity, allocations to other new or modified lots shall be reduced in proportion to their respective lot areas. All reallocated limits that otherwise would include fractions shall be rounded down to the next integer. For purposes of adjustment of allocations described in this subsection 23.75.040.D.7, a combined lot then existing for any limit is treated as a single lot for that limit.
5. Formula parking allowance transfers.

    1. The portion of the formula parking allowance for a sector permitted on any lot is that portion attributable to the non-parking uses developed on that lot, except as permitted in this subsection 23.75.040.E.
    2. To the extent that the amount of parking existing, established by permit, and subject to pending applications for permits on a lot is less than the amount allowed under this subsection 23.75.040.E, the owner of that lot may transfer formula parking credits to another lot in the sector, in a manner prescribed by the Director.
    3. The transfer of formula parking credits increases the number of parking spaces permitted on the lot receiving the transfer and reduces the number of spaces permitted on the lot from which the transfer is made by the same amount.

1. In order to count toward the conditions to a higher tier under Table A for 23.75.085, affordable housing shall be committed under recorded covenants or instruments, acceptable to the Director of Housing, to satisfy the following requirements:

    1. Term. The affordable housing shall serve only income eligible households for replacement units, 60 percent of MI units, or 80 percent of MI units, as defined in Section 23.75.020, for a minimum of fifty years from the date when the affordable housing becomes available for occupancy as determined by the Director of Housing.
    2. Affordability. Units must be committed to affordability as follows:

        1. Except as permitted in subsection 23.75.085.C.2.b.5, for replacement units, monthly rent, including basic utilities, shall be as allowed under the 1937 U.S. Housing Act, as amended, and agreements between the Seattle Housing Authority and the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) and, for City-funded replacement units, agreements between the Seattle Housing Authority and the City of Seattle. Rent may increase in proportion to household income for qualifying tenants provided that rent shall not exceed 30 percent of 80 percent of median income. For purposes of this section, Yesler Terrace residents who are eligible to return pursuant to a relocation plan adopted by the Seattle Housing Authority shall be deemed to have met initial occupancy requirements.
        2. Except as permitted in subsection 23.75.085.C.2.b.5, for 60 percent of MI units, monthly rent, including basic utilities, shall not exceed 30 percent of 60 percent of median income.
        3. For 80 percent of MI units that are rental housing, monthly rent, including basic utilities, shall not exceed 30 percent of 80 percent of median income.
        4. For 80 percent of MI units that are offered for sale, the initial sale price shall not exceed an amount determined by the Director of Housing to be affordable to a household with an income, at the time of initial occupancy by the household, no higher than 80 percent of median income. The unit shall be subject to recorded covenants or instruments satisfactory to the Director of Housing providing for sales prices on any resales consistent with affordability requirements on the same basis for at least fifty years. The Director of Housing is authorized to adopt, by rule, the method of determining affordability, including estimated monthly housing costs and requirements relating to down payment amount and homebuyer contributions.
        5. The Director of Housing is authorized to amend covenants to adjust affordability and income limits up to a maximum of 30 percent of 80 percent of median income if the Director of Housing determines that:

            1. in the case of replacement units, a reduction in federal operating subsidies has made such funding insufficient to maintain the replacement units for households with incomes at or below 30 percent of median income;
            2. in the case of 60 percent of MI units, after 40 years from initial occupancy of a building, rent levels are insufficient to operate and maintain the units or to meet any required debt coverage ratios as required by financing;
            3. the number of units with adjusted affordability has been minimized to the extent practical, and
            4. one or more agreements are entered into between the housing owner and the Director of Housing committing the housing owner(s) to new affordability and occupancy requirements effective when replacement units and/or 60 percent of MI units are vacated and available for occupancy by new tenants.
    3. Size. If provided in a development permitted under a single master use permit that includes dwelling units other than affordable housing, the average net floor area of the affordable housing units shall be no smaller than the average net floor area per unit of the development as a whole.
    4. Location. Affordable housing must be located within the Yesler Terrace redevelopment area. No more than 140 of the replacement units shall be located east of Boren Avenue. A minimum of 50 replacement units shall be located in at least five of the eight blocks west of Boren Avenue. When provided within a development permitted under a single master use permit that includes dwelling units other than affordable housing, the affordable housing shall generally be distributed throughout the development.
2. No subsidies for 80 percent of MI units; exceptions

    1. The associated covenant required in order for an 80 percent of MI unit to count toward the conditions to a higher tier under Table A for 23.75.085 must include provisions prohibiting subsidies provided for or related to that unit. For purposes of this subsection 23.75.085.C.3, "subsidies" includes federal loans or grants, City of Seattle housing loans or grants, developer contributions for affordable housing made in exchange for bonus floor area in a zone other than MPC-YT, county housing funds, and State of Washington housing funds, except as provided in this subsection 23.75.085.C.3.
    2. Housing that is or upon completion would be subject to any restrictions on the income of occupants, rents, or sale prices, independent of requirements in this Section 23.75.085 and Chapter 5.73, may not be counted as affordable housing under this Section 23.75.085, except as provided in subsection 23.75.085.C.3.c.
    3. For purposes of this subsection 23.75.085.C.3, the following do not constitute a subsidy, and any related conditions regarding incomes, rents, or sale prices do not constitute restrictions:

        1. Any benefit to the developer of discounted land sales prices;
        2. Use of Washington State Housing Finance Commission bonds and 4-percent low-income housing tax credits; and
        3. The qualification for and use of property tax exemptions pursuant to Chapter 5.73.

1. Purpose. The provisions of this Section 23.75.085 are intended to implement an affordable housing incentive program as authorized by RCW 36.70A.540.
2. Findings. Pursuant to the authority of RCW 36.70A.540, the City finds that:

    1. The phased redevelopment of the properties in the MPC-YT zone addresses the need for increased residential development to achieve local growth management and housing policies; and
    2. The terms of the affordable housing incentive program in this Section 23.75.085 take into account that federal funding is expected for housing that will replace existing public housing and that will serve households with incomes, at the time of initial occupancy by the household, at or below 30 percent of median income, but that for affordable housing not receiving federal subsidies, the higher income levels specified in the definitions of "60 percent of MI unit" and "80 percent of MI unit" in this Chapter 23.75, rather than the level stated for rental housing in the definition of "low-income households" in RCW 36.70A.540, are needed to address local housing market conditions.
3. Residential floor area limits.

    1. The aggregate residential floor area limit for built and permitted development on all lots within the MPC-YT zone is established in Table A for 23.75.085 and subject to the following conditions:

        1. The aggregate residential floor area limit is increased in stages, referred to as "tiers," when affordable housing is provided in accordance with the terms of this Section 23.75.085 in amounts sufficient to satisfy the conditions for the next tier according to Table A for 23.75.085.
        2. The Tier 1 limit is the base, so no affordable housing needs to be provided in order for aggregate residential floor area to reach the Tier 1 limit.
        3. If the total amount of constructed or permitted floor area reaches the applicable tier limit, but affordable housing production conditions have not been satisfied, no further building permits for residential floor area may be issued except for replacement units, 60 percent of MI units, or 80 percent of MI units. In counting total permitted residential floor area, projects with expired or cancelled permits shall not be included.
        4. After the maximum residential floor area allowed has been increased to Tier 4, no Master Use Permit for a development including residential floor area shall be issued unless the development application includes a number of 80 percent of MI units equal to 4.5 percent of the total number of dwelling units in the application that are not either replacement units or 60 percent of MI units.
4. Production.

    1. A unit of affordable housing that satisfies the conditions of subsection 23.75.085.C shall be counted for purposes of Table A for 23.75.085 when the affordable housing is subject to recorded covenants or instruments that conform to this Section 23.75.085 and are satisfactory to the Director of Housing in form, content and priority. Any unit or units of housing provided as a condition to bonus floor area pursuant to any Land Use Code section other than 23.75.085 shall not be counted for purposes of Table A for 23.75.085.
    2. All dwelling units other than replacement units, 60 percent of MI units, and 80 percent of MI units shall be counted as completed when a Master Use Permit for construction of those units has been issued, unless and until either

        1. the Master Use Permit decision is cancelled before the Master Use Permit is issued, or the Master Use Permit issued pursuant to such decision expires or is cancelled, without the highrise structure having been constructed; or
        2. a ruling by a hearing examiner or court of competent jurisdiction reversing or vacating such decision, or determining such decision or the Master Use Permit issued thereunder to be invalid, becomes final and no longer subject to judicial review.
5. Tier determination. Upon application by any owner within the MPC-YT zone, the Director may make a Type I decision as to the residential floor area tier in effect.
6. Rules. The Director and the Director of Housing are authorized jointly to adopt rules to interpret and implement the provisions of this Section 23.75.085, in addition to rules that may be adopted by the Director of Housing independently as authorized in this Section 23.75.085.
7. Distribution of residential floor area limits by sector. Table B for 23.75.085 establishes residential maximum floor area limits by sector. The sum of the sector allocations exceeds the maximum established for the entire zone, but this subsection 23.75.085.G does not allow the total amount of residential floor area in all sectors combined to exceed the limit in effect under Table A for 23.75.085.
8. Floor area subject to the limits in this Section 23.75.085 is all residential gross floor area except for accessory parking and floor area in residential structures existing as of January 1, 2012.
9. Fees. For developments that include 80 percent of MI units provided to meet affordable housing production conditions in this Section 23.75.085, the applicant and owner shall pay fees to the Office of Housing as specified under Section 22.900G.015.

##### 23.75.090 - Nonresidential floor area limits

1. Nonresidential floor area. Except as provided in subsection 23.75.090.B, the aggregate nonresidential floor area limits for built and permitted development on all lots within the MPC-YT zone are as follows:

    1. Combined floor area for office, medical services, and lodging shall not exceed 900,000 square feet.
    2. Combined floor area for all other nonresidential uses shall not exceed 150,000 square feet.
2. Floor area subject to the limits in this Section 23.75.090 is all nonresidential gross floor area except:

    1. Community clubs or centers;
    2. Child care centers;
    3. Family support centers;
    4. Human service uses;
    5. Accessory parking;
    6. Floor area below grade; and
    7. Floor area within landmark structures existing and designated as of January 1, 2012.

##### 23.75.095 - Maximum size of use

1. Size limits in this Section 23.75.095 apply to the total size of a business establishment, except that if a business establishment includes more than one principal use, size limits apply separately to the size of each principal use that the business establishment proposes within the MPC-YT zone.
2. Sales and services uses are limited to no more than 25,000 square feet of gross floor area per business establishment.
3. In each sector except the NW sector, office and lodging are limited to no more than 25,000 square feet of gross floor area per business establishment.
4. In each sector except the NW Sector, medical services are limited to no more than 15,000 square feet of gross floor area per business establishment, except that as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76 the Director may permit a single business establishment containing medical services uses up to 25,000 square feet of gross floor area, based on consideration of the following factors:

    1. Whether the amount of medical services uses existing and proposed in the vicinity would result in an area containing a concentration of medical services that compromises the neighborhood's mixed use character; and
    2. Whether medical service uses would disrupt a continuous commercial street front, particularly of general sales and services uses, or significantly detract from an area's overall neighborhood-serving commercial character.

![23-75-145.png](./images/23-75-145.png)


1. In order to be considered a separate façade plane for the purposes of this subsection 23.75.145.D, a portion of the façade shall have a minimum area of 150 square feet and a maximum area of 500 square feet, and shall project or be recessed from abutting façade planes by a minimum depth of 18 inches.
2. Trim that is a minimum of 0.75 inches deep and 3.5 inches wide is required to mark roof lines, porches, windows and doors on all regulated facades.

1. Intent. The intent of the design standards in this Section 23.75.145 is to:

    1. Enhance facades to provide visual interest, promote new development that contributes to an attractive streetscape, and avoid the appearance of blank walls along a street;
    2. Foster a sense of community by integrating new pedestrian-oriented multifamily development with the neighborhood street environment and by promoting designs that allow easy surveillance of the street by area residents; and
    3. Promote livability by providing a sense of openness and access to light and air.
2. Application of provisions. This Section 23.75.145 applies to all structures that contain residential uses and do not undergo any type of design review pursuant to Chapter 23.41. For those structures, the standards apply to regulated facades between finished grade and 50 feet above finished grade.
3. For the purposes of this Section 23.75.145, the facade includes all vertical and substantially vertical surfaces enclosing interior space, including gables and dormers.
4. Façade articulation.

    1. If a regulated façade exceeds 750 square feet in area, division of the façade into separate facade planes is required (see Exhibit A for 23.75.145).
5. The Director may allow exceptions to the façade articulation requirements in this Section 23.75.145, if the Director determines that the façade will meet the intent of subsection 23.75.145.A through one or more of the following façade treatments:

    1. Variations in building materials and/or color, or both, that reflect the stacking of stories or reinforce the articulation of the façade;
    2. Incorporation of architectural features that add interest and dimension to the façade, such as porches, bay windows, chimneys, pilasters, columns, cornices, and/or balconies; or
    3. Landscaping elements such as trellises or modular green walls that accommodate vegetated walls covering a minimum of 25 percent of the façade surface.

##### 23.75.150 - Residential amenity areas

2. General requirements.

    1. All dwelling units shall have access to a common amenity area or private amenity area.
    2. No more than 50 percent of the required amenity area may be enclosed within a structure. Enclosed area within a structure that is not common amenity area does not count as required amenity area.
    3. Required amenity area that is not enclosed shall be open to the sky, except for any overhead weather protection or balconies, and except that structural projections that do not provide floor area, such as garden windows, may extend up to 2 feet into a required amenity area if they are at least 8 feet above the surface of the amenity area.
    4. Areas open to the public by easement do not qualify as required amenity areas. Portions of a pedestrian pathway that are not subject to a public easement may qualify as required amenity area.
    5. Parking areas, access drives, and driveways do not qualify as required amenity areas, except that portions of an access drive other than driving surfaces, parking surfaces, or areas dedicated to public use by easement may provide a maximum of 50 percent of the required amenity area.
    6. Pursuant to subsection 23.57.011.C.1, rooftop areas adjacent to minor communication utilities or accessory communication devices do not qualify as required amenity areas.

Exhibit D forSetback for Partially Underground Parking in Locations Other Than Build-to Lines and Reduced Setback Areas


1. Parking is regulated by this Section 23.75.180 and not by Sections 23.54.015, 23.54.016, 23.54.030.A, or 23.54.030.B, except for bicycle parking, which is required pursuant to subsection 23.54.015.K. Parking maximums in this Section 23.75.180 do not include parking for dwelling units existing as of January 1, 2012, so long as those units exist.
2. There is no minimum requirement for parking spaces for motor vehicles. Maximum motor vehicle parking space limits are as follows:

    1. For the NW Sector, parking shall not exceed 1,350 spaces, plus 0.7 spaces per dwelling unit or live-work unit in the sector, except that up to an additional 450 parking spaces may be permitted as a special exception pursuant to Chapter 23.76. When deciding whether to grant a special exception, the Director shall consider evidence of parking demand for nonresidential uses and alternative means of transportation, including but not limited to the following:

        1. Whether the additional parking will substantially encourage the use of single occupancy vehicles;
        2. Characteristics of the work force and employee hours, such as multiple shifts that end when transit service is not readily available;
        3. Proximity of transit lines to the lot and headway times of those lines;
        4. Whether the additional parking will adversely affect vehicular and pedestrian circulation in the area; and
        5. Potential for shared use of additional parking as residential or short-term parking.
    2. For the NE, SE, and SW Sectors, Table A for 23.75.180 establishes maximum parking allowed based on the uses on a lot, subject to any transfer of unused parking allowance between lots in the same sector under Section 23.75.040.
3. Barrier-free parking is required consistent with Seattle Building Code requirements.
4. For purposes of this Section 23.75.180, all parking is classified as "surface parking," as defined in Section 23.84A.030, or as "aboveground," "partially underground," or "underground," as shown in Exhibit A for 23.75.180 and described as follows:

    1. "Aboveground parking" means any portion of a parking garage where:

        1. the structure projects more than 4 feet in height above finished grade within 30 feet of a build-to line or reduced setback area; or
        2. the structure projects more than 6 feet in height above finished grade in any other location.
    2. "Partially underground parking" means any portion of a parking garage where:

        2. the structure projects 6 feet or less in height above finished grade along any other location where the grade along the boundary has a slope of less than 6 percent; or
        3. the structure projects 10 feet or less in height above finished grade along any other location where the grade along the boundary has a slope of 6 percent or greater.
    3. "Underground parking" means a story of parking garage where all floor area, walls, and ceiling structure are entirely below finished grade, excluding access.
5. Standards for surface parking.

    1. The total number of surface parking spaces may not exceed 12 spaces per block.
    2. No more than five surface parking spaces may abut one another, and each group of abutting surface parking spaces shall be separated from other surface parking spaces by a minimum of 30 feet, measured between the two closest spaces.
    3. Parking spaces located on an access drive are not allowed within 30 feet of entrances to parking garages.
    4. Surface parking is not allowed in the required setback between a building and a street or park that is open to the public.
6. Aboveground parking is subject to the following requirements.

    1. Minimum setbacks for aboveground parking are established in Exhibit B for 23.75.180. No parking setbacks are required from lot lines abutting the Interstate 5 right-of-way.
7. Partially underground parking is subject to the following requirements:

    1. At build-to lines and in reduced setback areas as depicted in Exhibit C for 23.75.140, partially underground parking is required to be set back at least 2 feet from the boundary, as shown in Exhibit C for 23.75.180. In these locations, the aboveground portion of the parking garage is not allowed to exceed 4 feet above finished grade.
    2. Along boundaries that do not abut a street, park that is open to the public, pedestrian pathway, or access drive, no setback is required for partially underground parking.
8. Underground parking may extend to the lot line. The Director may determine, as a Type I Decision, that underground parking may extend beneath private access drives, pedestrian pathways, and parks, provided that:

    1. The underground parking does not conflict with or reduce the quality of public access areas above; and
    2. The underground parking does not interfere with underground public utility alignments established in the Yesler Terrace plat.
9. Parking and loading access

    1. Access for parking and for loading is required to meet the following requirements:

        1. Access is not allowed within 40 feet of the curb line of an intersection.
        2. Access is not allowed within 20 feet of a structure corner that includes a regulated façade on one or both sides.
    2. Each access drive is required to include a dedicated pedestrian area along at least one side of the length of the drive. The dedicated pedestrian area is required to:

        1. include a walking surface at least 6 feet wide along the length of the access drive; and
        2. be separated from the access drive roadway by a raised curb, bollards, landscaping, or textured paving details.
    3. Curb cuts are required to meet the standards of subsections 23.54.030.F and 23.54.030.G.
    4. Driveways are required to meet the standards of subsection 23.54.030.D.




## Subtitle IV - Administration
### Division 1 - Land Use Approval Procedures

### Chapter 23.76 - PROCEDURES FOR MASTER USE PERMITS AND COUNCIL LAND USE DECISIONS

Sections:

#### Subchapter I - General Provisions
##### 23.76.002 - Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish standard procedures for land use decisions made by The City of Seattle. The procedures are designed to promote informed public participation in discretionary land use decisions, eliminate redundancy in the application submittal process, and minimize delays and expense in appeals of land use decisions. As required by RCW 36.70B.060, these procedures provide for an integrated and consolidated land use permit process, integrate the environmental review process with the procedures for review of land use decisions, and provide for the consolidation of appeals for all land use decisions.


##### 23.76.004 - Land use decision framework

1. Land use decisions are classified into five categories. Procedures for the five different categories are distinguished according to who makes the decision, the type and amount of public notice required, and whether appeal opportunities are provided. Land use decisions are generally categorized by type in Table A for 23.76.004.
2. Type I and II decisions are made by the Director and are consolidated in Master Use Permits. Type I decisions are decisions made by the Director that are not appealable to the Hearing Examiner. Type II decisions are discretionary decisions made by the Director that are subject to an administrative open record appeal hearing to the Hearing Examiner; provided that Type II decisions enumerated in subsections 23.76.006.C.2.c, d, f, and g, and SEPA decisions integrated with them as set forth in subsection 23.76.006.C.2.m, shall be made by the Council when associated with a Council land use decision and are not subject to administrative appeal. Type III decisions are made by the Hearing Examiner after conducting an open record hearing and not subject to administrative appeal. Type I, II or III decisions may be subject to land use interpretation pursuant to Section 23.88.020.
3. Type IV and V decisions are Council land use decisions. Type IV decisions are quasi-judicial decisions made by the Council pursuant to existing legislative standards and based upon the Hearing Examiner's record and recommendation. Type IV decisions may be subject to land use interpretation pursuant to Section 23.88.020. Type V decisions are legislative decisions made by the Council in its capacity to establish policy and manage public lands.
4. For projects requiring both a Master Use Permit and a Council land use decision as described in this chapter, the Council decision must be made prior to issuance of the Master Use Permit. All conditions established by the Council in its decision shall be incorporated in any subsequently issued Master Use Permit for the project.
5. Certain land use decisions are subject to additional procedural requirements beyond the standard procedures established in this Chapter 23.76. These requirements may be prescribed in the regulations for the zone in which the proposal is located, in other provisions of this title, or in other titles of the Seattle Municipal Code.
6. Shoreline appeals and appeals of related SEPA determinations shall be filed with the State Shoreline Hearings Board within 21 days of the receipt of the decision by the Department of Ecology as set forth in RCW 90.58.180.
7. An applicant for a permit or permits requiring more than one decision contained in the land use decision framework listed in Section 23.76.004 may either:

    1. Use the integrated and consolidated process established in this chapter;
    2. If the applicant includes a variance, lot boundary adjustment, or short subdivision approval and no environmental review is required for the proposed project pursuant to SMC Chapter 25.05, Environmental Policies and Procedures, file a separate Master Use Permit application for the variance, lot boundary adjustment, or short subdivision sought and use the integrated and consolidated process established in this chapter for all other required decisions; or
    3. Proceed with separate applications for each permit decision sought.
8. If notice is required pursuant to this Chapter 23.76, except mailed notice as defined in Section 23.84A.025, it may be provided by electronic means if the recipient provides an e-mail address to the Department. Notice to City agencies may be provided through the City's interoffice mail or by electronic means.

##### 23.76.005 - Time for decisions

1. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 23.76.005 or otherwise agreed to by the applicant, land use decisions on applications shall be made within 120 days after the applicant has been notified that the application is complete. In determining the number of days that have elapsed after the notification that the application is complete, the following periods shall be excluded:

    5. All periods of time during which the applicant has been requested by the Director to pay past-due permit fees, until the Director determines that the request has been satisfied or until the permit is cancelled for failure to pay fees.
2. The time required to prepare an EIS shall be agreed to by the Director and applicant in writing. Unless otherwise agreed to by the applicant, a final environmental impact statement shall be issued by the Director within one year following the issuance of a Determination of Significance for the proposal, unless the EIS consultant advises that a longer time period is necessary. In that case, the additional time shall be that recommended by the consultant, not to exceed an additional year.
3. The time limits established by subsections 23.76.005.A and B do not apply if a permit application:

    1. requires an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan or the Land Use Code; or
    2. requires the siting of an essential public facility; or
    3. is substantially revised by the applicant, in which case the time period shall start from the date at which the revised project application is determined to be complete.
4. Exclusions pursuant to RCW 36.70B.140(1).

    1. Type II decisions. There is no time limit for a decision on an application that includes an exception from the regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas, Chapter 25.09.

            1. The time during which a Type III decision is remanded by the Hearing Examiner for further information or analysis. The Hearing Examiner shall set a reasonable period for the remand after consideration of the nature and complexity of the issues, and, if practicable, after consultation with the parties about the reasonableness of the remand period;
            2. All periods of time during which the applicant has been requested by the Director to pay past-due permit fees, until the Director determines that the request has been satisfied; and
            3. Any extension of time mutually agreed upon by the Hearing Examiner and the applicant.
    3. Type IV Council land use decisions.

        1. There is no time limit for decisions on Major Institution master plans.
        2. All other Type IV Council land use decisions and any associated Type II decisions listed in subsection 23.76.006.C.2, except for the exclusions listed in subsections 23.76.005.D.1 and 23.76.005.D.3.c, shall be made within the following time periods:

            3. The Council shall issue its decision within 90 days of receipt of the Hearing Examiner recommendation, except that if a timely appeal is filed with the City Clerk, the Council shall issue its decision within 120 days of receipt of the Hearing Examiner recommendation.
        3. In determining the time limits for Type IV Council land use decisions established in this subsection 23.76.005.D, the following periods shall be excluded:

            1. The time during which a Type IV Council land use decision is remanded by the Hearing Examiner or Council for further information or analysis. The Hearing Examiner or the Council shall set a reasonable period for the remand after consideration of the nature and complexity of the issues, and, if practicable, after consultation with the parties about the reasonableness of the remand period;
            2. All periods of time during which the applicant has been requested by the Director to pay past-due permit fees, until the Director determines that the request has been satisfied; and
            3. Any extension of time mutually agreed upon by the Hearing Examiner and the applicant or the City Council and the applicant.

Within 14 days of receiving the additional information, the Director shall notify the applicant in writing if the application is still incomplete and what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the Director does not notify the applicant in writing that the application is incomplete by the deadlines in this subsection 23.76.010.E. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested.
    2. A Master Use Permit application is complete for purposes of this Section 23.76.010 if it meets the submittal requirements established by the Director in subsection 23.76.010.D and is sufficient for continued processing even though additional information may be required or project modifications may be undertaken subsequently. The determination of completeness shall not preclude the Director from requesting additional information or studies either at the time the application is determined complete or subsequently, if additional information is required to complete review of the application or substantial changes in the permit application are proposed.
    3. A determination under this Section 23.76.010 that an application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested. A vesting determination shall be made only if needed because of a change in applicable laws and shall entail review of the application for compliance with RCW 19.27.095, RCW 58.17.033, and Section 23.76.026.
6. If the applicant fails to supply all required information or data within 60 days of a written request from the Director, the Director may provide the applicant a notice of intent to cancel.

        6. The Master Use Permit is for development subject to Section 23.49.180, in which case the provisions in subsection 23.76.032.A.1.f apply.
2.

The Council's decision to approve, approve with conditions, remand, or deny the application for a Type IV Council land use decision shall be based on applicable law and supported by substantial evidence in the record established pursuant to Section 23.76.054. An appellant bears the burden of proving that the Hearing Examiner's recommendation should be rejected or modified.
2. The Council shall adopt written findings and conclusions in support of its decision regarding Type IV Council land use decisions.
3. To the extent such information is available to the Council, the decision should contain the name and address of the owner of the property at issue, of the applicant, and of each person who filed an appeal of the Hearing Examiner's recommendation with the Council, unless such person abandoned the appeal or such person's claims were dismissed before the hearing.
4. Any Type IV Council land use decision shall be final and conclusive unless Council retains jurisdiction or the decision is reversed or remanded on judicial appeal or appeal to the Shorelines Hearings Board. Any judicial review of a decision shall be commenced as provided by state law, and an appeal of a decision concerning personal wireless service must be commenced within 30 days of issuance of the decision.
5. The City Clerk shall promptly transmit a copy of the findings, conclusions and decision, and ordinance if applicable, to the Director, the Hearing Examiner, and all parties of record.

##### 23.76.058 - Rules for specific Council land use decisions

1. Shoreline Decisions. For shoreline environment reclassifications, a copy of the Council's findings, conclusions and decision shall also be filed with the Department of Ecology. Shoreline environment reclassifications shall not become effective until approved by the Department of Ecology.
2. Contract Rezones.

    1. Within 30 days after adoption of the ordinance approving a contract rezone, the City Clerk shall record the executed property use and development agreement (PUDA) with the King County Recorder.
    2. The zoning designation established by the contract rezone shall not take effect until the later of:

        1. the effective date of the ordinance approving the contract rezone and accepting the PUDA, as specified in the ordinance or pursuant to Section 1.04.020, or
        2. the recording by the City Clerk with the King County Recorder of the PUDA executed by the legal and beneficial owners.
3. Amendment of PUDAs for Title 23 zones. Property use and development agreements recorded as a condition of a contract rezone may be amended by agreement between the owner and the City, if the amendment is approved by the Council.

    1. Applications to amend a PUDA shall meet the requirements of Section 23.76.040.
    2. Applications to amend a PUDA are subject to a 14 day comment period.
    3. In addition to the notice required pursuant to Section 23.76.012, the Director shall provide notice of an application to amend a PUDA and the 14-day comment period on the application to the parties of record in the original rezone decision and to those persons who were provided written notice of the Hearing Examiner's recommendation in the original rezone decision, to the extent reasonably practicable.
    4. The Director shall determine whether the amendment is major or minor. This determination is a Type I decision.

        1. Minor amendments. A minor amendment to a PUDA is one that is within the spirit and general purpose of the prior decision of the Council, is generally consistent with the uses and development standards approved in the prior decision of the Council, would not result in significant adverse impacts that were not anticipated in the prior decision of the Council, and does not request any additional waivers or changes in the waivers of bulk or off-street parking and loading requirements other than those approved in the prior decision of the Council. If the Director determines that a proposed amendment is minor, the Director shall transmit to Council the application to amend, the Director's determination that the proposed amendment is minor, any comments received by the Director on the proposed amendment, and the Director's recommendation on the proposed amendment. An application to amend that is minor and that complies with the rezone criteria of Chapter 23.34 may be approved by the Council by ordinance after receiving any additional advice that it deems necessary.
        2. Major Amendments. Applications to amend a PUDA that are not minor are major. Major amendments to a PUDA shall follow the procedures for Type IV Council land use decisions in Sections 23.76.052, 23.76.054, and 23.76.056.
4. Public Projects Not Meeting Development Standards. The City Council may waive or modify applicable developments standards, accessory use requirements, special use requirements, and conditional use criteria for public projects.

##### 23.76.060 - Expiration and extension of Council land use decisions

Part 3 Legislative Decisions (Type V)


1. Decisions granted under Title 24. The expiration of Council land use decisions granted under Title 24 is governed by the applicable provisions of Section 23.04.010, Transition to the Land Use Code.
2. Council conditional uses and public projects.

    1. Approvals of Council conditional uses and public projects expire three years from the effective date of approval unless:

        1. Within the three year period, an application is filed for a Master Use Permit, that is subsequently issued; or
        2. Another time for expiration is specified in the Council's decision.
    2. If a Master Use Permit is issued for a project permitted by Council approval of a Council conditional use or a public project, the Council's approval of the Council conditional use or public project remains in effect until the date that the Master Use Permit expires pursuant to the provisions of Section 23.76.032, or until the date specified by the Council, whichever is later. If a Master Use Permit is issued for a project permitted by Council approval of a Council conditional use or Council approval of a public project, a building permit is issued for the project, and the project is constructed pursuant to the building permit, conditions required by the Council's approval of the Council conditional use or the Council's approval of the public project shall remain in effect, notwithstanding expiration of the Council's approval of the Council conditional use or the Council's approval of the public project, until the project is demolished or until an earlier date on which:

        1. the condition by its terms expires;
        2. the condition is removed through a permitting decision; or
        3. if the condition was imposed as to a specific use within the project, that use is terminated.
3. Contract Rezones.

    1. The provisions of this section 23.76.060.C.1 apply except as otherwise provided in the Council decision on a contract rezone.

        1. A zoning designation established by a contract rezone shall expire three years after the date of the Council action approving the rezone, except as follows:

            1. If, prior to the end of the three year period, a complete application is filed for a Master Use Permit to establish a use on the rezoned property, the zoning designation shall not expire pursuant to this Section 23.76.060 as to the lot or lots for which the application is made so long as that application remains pending. The zoning designation shall expire immediately upon any cancellation of the application that occurs after the end of the three year period, unless another such application filed before the end of that period is pending at the time of such cancellation;
            2. If a Master Use Permit is issued based on an application that is sufficient to extend the three year period under subsection 23.76.060.C.1.a.1), then the zoning designation shall not expire pursuant to this Section 23.76.060 as to the lot or lots for which the permit is issued unless and until the Master Use Permit expires without a certificate of occupancy having been issued for any structure constructed or altered for a use authorized by any such Master Use Permit, and then shall immediately expire. If such a certificate of occupancy is issued, then the zoning designation shall not expire pursuant to this Section 23.76.060 for that lot or lots;
            3. If only a portion of the rezoned property is the subject of a particular application or Master Use Permit, then the zoning designation shall expire as to the other portions of the rezoned property at the same time as if that application had not been made or that permit not issued, as the case may be.
    2. When a contract rezone expires, the Official Land Use Map is automatically amended so the zoning designation in effect immediately prior to the contract rezone applies to the subject property, except to the extent otherwise expressly provided by ordinance. The Director shall file a notice of expiration with the City Clerk and with the King County Recorder and shall cause the reversion to the former designation to be shown on published land use maps, but the expiration shall be effective notwithstanding any failure to make such filing or to reflect such expiration in any published information. Unless expressly stated otherwise in any property use and development agreement (PUDA) recorded in connection with a rezone, if the zoning designation expires as to all property subject to the PUDA, then all restrictions and requirements in the PUDA shall terminate.
    3. Regardless of whether the time period for expiration has elapsed or a certificate of occupancy has been issued as described in subsection 23.76.060.C.1.a.2), the zoning designation established by a contract rezone shall no longer be in effect upon the effective date of a subsequent rezoning by the Council of the subject property, either through a site-specific rezone or as part of an area-wide rezone. Effective on or after the effective date of such subsequent rezoning of all property subject to a PUDA recorded in connection with the prior rezone, some or all of that property may be released from some or all of the conditions of the PUDA if the release is authorized by ordinance. Such release may be authorized without following the PUDA amendment procedures in 23.76.058, except that notice and a comment period shall be provided pursuant to 23.76.058.C.3. In making the decision whether to release all or part of the PUDA, the Council shall consider factors such as:

        1. whether any of the property subject to the PUDA has been or may still be developed in a manner that was permitted under the designation established by the contract rezone and would not be permitted under the subsequent rezoning; and
        2. the extent to which any terms of the PUDA as applied to the subsequently rezoned property are relevant to the impacts of any development of that property occurring subsequent to the PUDA.
4. Variances. Variances granted as part of a Council land use decision shall remain in effect for the same period as the land use decision granted, except those variances granted as part of a rezone, which shall expire on the date the rezone expires or the effective date of any text amendment making more stringent the development standard from which the variance was granted, whichever is sooner.
5. Extensions. The Council may extend the time limits on Type IV land use decisions for no more than two years, upon an applicant's filing an application to the Department at least 120 days before the approval's expiration. The Council may request a recommendation on the extension application from the Director, but the Hearing Examiner hearing and recommendation requirements of Section 23.76.052 do not apply. Notice of applications for extensions of Type IV land use decisions and an opportunity to comment shall be provided pursuant to subsections 23.76.012.B.1 or B.2, and subsection 23.76.012.B.3, and notice and an opportunity to comment shall also be provided to the parties of record in the Council's original Type IV land use proceeding and to those persons who were provided written notice of the Hearing Examiner's recommendation on the original Type IV application to the extent reasonably practicable.

    1. The Council may not extend the time limit for a Type IV land use decision for a project that is not in conformance with applicable regulations, including land use and environmentally critical areas regulations, in effect at the time application for an extension is made.
    2. In deciding whether to grant an extension, the Council shall consider:

        1. The reason or basis for the application for the extension and whether it is reasonable under the circumstances;
        2. Whether changed circumstances in the area support an extension;
        3. Whether additional time is reasonably necessary to comply with a condition of approval adopted by the Council that is required to be fulfilled prior to expiration of the Council land use decision.

##### 23.76.062 - Type V Council land use decisions

1. Notice of application. For Major Institution designations and revocations of Major Institution designations, concept approvals for the location or expansion of City facilities requiring Council land use approval, and waivers or modifications of development standards for City facilities, notice of application shall be provided pursuant to Section 23.76.012.
2. Public Hearing. The Council shall conduct a public hearing for each Type V Council land use decision except that no public hearing is required for an emergency amendment to the text of the Land Use Code. The Council may also appoint a hearing officer to conduct an additional fact-finding hearing to assist the Council in gathering information. Any hearing officer so appointed shall transmit written Findings of Fact to the Council within ten days of the additional hearing.
3. Notice of Hearings.

    1. Notice of a required Council hearing on a Type V Council land use decision shall be provided by the Director at least 30 days prior to the hearing in the following manner:

        1. Inclusion in the Land Use Information Bulletin; and
        2. Publication in the City's official newspaper.
    2. Additional notice shall be provided by the Director for public hearings on concept approvals for the location or expansion of City facilities, waiver or modification of development standards for City facilities, Major Institution designations, and revocation of Major Institution designations, as follows:

        1. Mailed notice; and
        2. One land use sign posted visible to the public at each street frontage abutting the site, except that if there is no street frontage or the site abuts an unimproved street, the Director shall either post more than one sign and/or select an alternative posting location so that notice is clearly visible to the public. For hearings on Major Institution designations and revocations of Major Institution designations, the Director shall post one land use sign at each street frontage abutting the site but not to exceed ten land use signs.
4. Council Decision. In making a Type V Council land use decision, the Council shall consider the oral and written testimony presented at the public hearing, as well as any required report of the Director. The City Council shall not act on any Type V Council land use decision until the end of the appeal period for any applicable determination of nonsignificance (DNS) or final EIS or, if an appeal is filed, until the Hearing Examiner issues a decision affirming the Director's DNS or EIS decision.

##### 23.76.064 - Approval of City facilities.

1. Concept Approval for City Facilities.

    1. In acting on the proposed siting or expansion of a City facility, the Council shall decide whether to approve in concept the facility. If concept approval is granted, the Council may impose terms and conditions, including but not limited to design criteria and conditions relating to the size and configuration of the proposed facility.
    2. Following Council approval, final plans for a City facility shall be submitted to the Director. If the Director determines that the project is consistent with the Council's concept approval, the Director shall issue the necessary permits for the facility.
    3. No further Council action is required for a City facility unless the Director determines that the final plans represent a major departure from the terms of the original Council concept approval, in which case the final plan shall be submitted to the Council for approval in the same manner as the original application.
2. City Facilities Not Meeting Development Standards. The Council may waive or modify applicable development standards, accessory use requirements, special use requirements or conditional use criteria for City facilities.

##### 23.76.066 - Shoreline Master Program amendments

Council decisions approving an amendment to the text of Chapter 23.60A, Shoreline District, shall be sent to the Director of the Department of Ecology. Such amendments shall become effective as provided by applicable state law.


##### 23.76.067 - Amendments to Title 23 to implement RCW 43.21C.420 (SEPA)

1. Unless an ordinance enacting amendments to Title 23 expressly recites that the ordinance is intended to implement RCW 43.21C.420, the provisions of that statute do not apply to the ordinance.
2. RCW 43.21C.420 bars certain SEPA appeals if the City has elected to adopt optional elements of the City's Comprehensive Plan or development regulations pursuant to RCW 43.21C.420. Unless an ordinance enacting or amending the Comprehensive Plan or development regulations expressly recites that it is being adopted pursuant to the authority of RCW 43.21C.420, RCW 43.21C.420 does not affect the availability of appeals. If RCW 43.21C.420 applies to a non-project EIS as described in RCW 43.21C.420, then unless the City Council by ordinance establishes a different time frame for submitting a complete application for purposes of RCW 43.21C.420 (5) with respect to that EIS, the time frame is 24 hours following the date of issuance of the final EIS.

##### 23.76.070 - Hearing Examiner reports to Council.

The Hearing Examiner shall compile and file with the Council a semi-annual report on issues of Code or policy interpretation arising in the Hearing Examiner's review of contested land use cases. The Hearing Examiner should report on all issues of general applicability which resulted in disagreement between the Director and the Hearing Examiner as to interpretation of Council intent. The Council will review the report and consider the need for code amendments to clarify its intent.

The committee shall operate pursuant to rules promulgated by the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods. The committee shall consist of the following:

    1. A representative of the City selected by the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods, to act as chairperson;
    2. A representative of the Seattle School District, or if the structure is no longer owned by the Seattle School District, a representative of the structure owner;

#### 23.79.008 - Advisory committee responsibilities.

The advisory committee shall perform the following functions:


1. It shall conduct one or more public meetings within a ninety (90) day period from formation of the advisory committee.
2. It shall gather and evaluate public comment.
3. It shall recommend the maximum departure which may be allowed for each development standard from which a departure has been requested. Minority reports shall be permitted. The advisory committee may not recommend that a standard be made more restrictive unless the restriction is necessary as a condition to mitigate the impacts of granting a development standard departure.

    1. Departures shall be evaluated for consistency with the general objectives and intent of the City's Land Use Code, including the rezone evaluation criteria in Chapter 23.34 of the Seattle Municipal Code, to ensure that the proposed facility is compatible with the character and use of its surroundings. In reaching recommendations, the advisory committee shall consider and balance the interrelationships among the following factors:

        1. Relationship to Surrounding Areas. The advisory committee shall evaluate the acceptable or necessary level of departure according to:

            1. Appropriateness in relation to the character and scale of the surrounding area;
            2. Presence of edges (significant setbacks, major arterials, topographic breaks, and similar features) which provide a transition in scale;
            3. Location and design of structures to reduce the appearance of bulk;
            4. Impacts on traffic, noise, circulation and parking in the area; and
            5. Impacts on housing and open space. More flexibility in the development standards may be allowed if the impacts on the surrounding community are anticipated to be negligible or are reduced by mitigation; whereas, a minimal amount or no departure from development standards may be allowed if the anticipated impacts are significant and cannot be satisfactorily mitigated.
        2. Need for Departure. The physical requirements of the specific proposal and the project's relationship to educational needs shall be balanced with the level of impacts on the surrounding area. Greater departure may be allowed for special facilities, such as a gymnasium, which are unique and/or an integral and necessary part of the educational process; whereas, a lesser or no departure may be granted for a facility which can be accommodated within the established development standards.
    2. When the departure process is required because of proposed demolition of housing, the desirability of minimizing the effects of demolition must be weighed against the educational objectives to be served in addition to the evaluation required in subsection C1.
    3. Following the evaluation set out in subsections C1 or C2, departures may be recommended as set forth in the regulations for the applicable zone and in Chapter 23.54. Recommendations must include consideration of the interrelationship among height, setback and landscaping standards when departures from height or setback are proposed.
4. The advisory committee shall recommend departure limits to the Director no later than ninety (90) days after its first meeting. Such recommendation shall be made after a majority or plurality vote. If only one (1) meeting is held, departure limits shall be recommended no later than thirty (30) days after the meeting. A ten (10) day extension may be granted by the Director if requested, in writing, by a majority of the advisory committee.

#### 23.79.010 - Duties of Director

1. The Director shall determine the amount of departure from established development standards that may be allowed or required, as well as mitigating measures that may be required.

#### 23.79.012 - Appeal of development standard departure

1. Any person substantially affected by or interested in the development standard departure may appeal the decision to the Hearing Examiner within a period extending to 5 p.m. of the 14 calendar day following the date of publication of the decision.

#### 23.80.004 - Review criteria

1. In reviewing an application for a proposed essential public facility, the decisionmaker shall consider the following:

    1. Interjurisdictional Analysis. A review to determine the extent to which an interjurisdictional approach may be appropriate, including consideration of possible alternative sites for the facility in other jurisdictions and an analysis of the extent to which the proposed facility is of a county-wide, regional or state-wide nature, and whether uniformity among jurisdictions should be considered.
    2. Financial Analysis. A review to determine if the financial impact upon The City of Seattle can be reduced or avoided by intergovernmental agreement.
    3. Special Purpose Districts. When the public facility is being proposed by a special purpose district, the City should consider the facility in the context of the district's overall plan and the extent to which the plan and facility are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
    4. Measures to Facilitate Siting. The factors that make a particular facility difficult to site should be considered when a facility is proposed, and measures should be taken to facilitate siting of the facility in light of those factors (such as the availability of land, access to transportation, compatibility with neighboring uses, and the impact on the physical environment).
2. If the decisionmaker determines that attaching conditions to the permit approval will facilitate project siting in light of the considerations identified above, the decisionmaker may establish conditions for the project for that purpose.
3. Light rail transit facilities

    1. Light rail transit facilities necessary to support the operation and maintenance of a light rail transit system are permitted in all zones and shoreline environments within the City of Seattle, except the CP Environment; such facilities are allowed in the CP Environment if in or on existing bridges, existing tunnels, or existing infrastructure related to a bridge or tunnel, or if other locations are infeasible under regulations of Chapter 23.60A, Shoreline District.
    2. The Director may approve a light rail transit facility pursuant to Chapter 23.76, Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions only if the alignment, transit station locations, and maintenance base location of the light rail transit system have been approved by the City Council by ordinance or resolution.
    3. When approving light rail transit facilities, the Director may impose reasonable conditions in order to lessen identified impacts on surrounding properties. A Master Use Permit is not required for the following:

        1. at-grade, below-grade, or above-grade tracks and their supporting structures;
        2. below-grade facilities;
        3. minor alteration of light rail transit facilities involving no material expansion or change of use; and
        4. other minor new construction that, in the determination of the Director, is not likely to have significant adverse impacts on surrounding properties.
    4. When approving light rail transit facilities, the Director may impose conditions to ensure consistency with design guidelines developed for the light rail system by the City and the applicant.
    5. The Director may waive or modify development standards applicable to a light rail transit facility if the applicant demonstrates that waiver or modification of a development standard:

        1. is reasonably necessary to allow the siting or proper functioning of a light rail transit facility; or
        2. will lessen the environmental impacts of a light rail transit facility on site or on surrounding properties; or
        3. will accommodate future development that will comply with development standards better than if the development standard waiver or modification were not granted.
    6. The Director may impose reasonable conditions on any waiver or modification of development standards to ensure consistency with design guidelines developed for the light rail system by the City and the applicant, and to lessen, to the extent feasible, environmental impacts of a light rail transit facility on site or on surrounding properties.
    7. A master use permit for light rail transit facilities shall not be issued until the Director has received satisfactory evidence that the applicant has obtained sufficient funding (which might include a Full Funding Grant Agreement with a federal agency) to complete the work described in the master use permit application.

Sections:

#### 23.86.002 - General provisions

1. For all calculations, the applicant shall be responsible for supplying drawings illustrating the measurements. These drawings shall be drawn to scale, and shall be of sufficient detail to allow verification upon inspection or examination by the Director.
2. Fractions.

    1. When any measurement technique for determining the number of items required or allowed, including but not limited to parking or bicycle spaces, or required trees or shrubs, results in fractional requirements, any fraction up to and including 0.5 of the applicable unit of measurement shall be disregarded and fractions over 0.5 shall require the next higher full unit of measurement.
    2. When any measurement technique for determining required minimum or allowed maximum dimensions, including but not limited to height, yards, setbacks, lot coverage, open space, building depth, parking space size or curb cut width, results in fractional requirements, the dimension shall be measured to the nearest inch. Any fraction up to and including 0.5 of an inch shall be disregarded and fractions over 0.5 of an inch shall require the next higher unit.
    3. Except within Lowrise multi-family zones, if density calculations result in a fraction of a unit, any fraction up to and including 0.5 constitutes zero additional units, and any fraction over 0.5 constitutes one additional unit. Within Lowrise multi-family zones, the effect of a density calculation that results in a fraction of a unit is as described in Table A for 23.45.512. This provision may not be applied to density calculations that result in a quotient less than one.

![23-86-004-3.png](./images/23-86-004-3.png)


1. Sign Area.

    1. For a sign which is an independent structure, the entire visible surface of the sign, exclusive of support devices, shall be included in area calculations. Only one (1) face of a double-faced sign shall be counted.
    2. For a sign painted or mounted directly on another structure, sign area shall be the area contained in the smallest rectangular area enclosing the graphic or worded message, measured by the projection of the legs of two (2) right angles that are placed at opposite corners of the graphic and/or worded message (Exhibit 23.86.004 A)
    3. Where a background color different from that of the face upon which a sign is located is used as part of the sign, the entire background area shall be included in area calculations (Exhibit 23.86.004 B).
    4. Only message-conveying text shall be included. Decorative graphics not conveying a readily apparent message are not counted in the area of the sign.
    5. For the purposes of measuring sign area for signs regulated by Section 23.55.042, signs adjacent to certain public highways, the following provisions shall also be used to calculate sign area:

        1. Where freestanding business signs and business signs on the face of a building are visible on the same premises, the sum of the area of both types of signs visible from any place on the traveled way shall not exceed the area permitted on the face of the building, except as provided for gas station signs and in subsection E1 of Section 23.55.042.
        2. Where a multi-faced sign is used, the greatest area visible from any place on the traveled way shall be measured.
    6. In major institution zones, when signs with and without size limits are combined, the portion of the sign to which a size limit applies shall not exceed the applicable limit.
2. Number of Signs. In certain zones, the type and number of signs is determined by amount of frontage on public rights-of-way, except alleys. Frontage shall be measured as follows:

    1. When only one (1) business establishment is located on a lot, or when determining the frontage of a multiple business center, frontage shall equal the length of the street property line(s) of the lot on which the business establishment or multiple business center is located (Exhibit 23.86.004 C).
    2. When determining the frontage of a business establishment located in a multiple business center, the following method shall be used:

        1. Draw the least rectangle that encloses the portion of the principal structure in which the business establishment is located, as well as any area used for outdoor sales or outdoor display of rental equipment.
        2. Extend the sides of the rectangle to the property line(s) of the lot which abut a right-of-way, except an alley, and which are not blocked from the rectangle by another structure or portion of the structure (Exhibit 23.86.004 D).
        3. The lineal footage of the frontage between the extended sides of the rectangle shall be the frontage of the business establishment for purposes of measuring the number and type of permitted signs.
3. Dispersion Standards for Off-premises Signs.

    1. Where linear dispersion of off-premises signs is required, the number of off-premises signs permitted on a street shall be calculated as follows:

        1. Project the centerline of each off-premises sign structure or sign painted on a structure to the centerline of each street from which the sign face is visible, at right angles to the street. Signs which are set so far back from a street that they are not visible from the street, sign structures which may be visible from the street but are oriented to face another street and permitted business district identification signs, shall not be counted.
        2. Signs on both sides of the street shall be counted, unless otherwise stated.
        3. Single-face billboards shall be considered one (1) structure for the purposes of this subsection.
        4. Double-face or "V" type shall be considered one (1) structure for the purposes of this subsection.
        5. Visually blocked advertising signs shall be considered one-half (½) of a sign structure for the purposes of this subsection.
        6. The number of permitted signs shall be measured from the projections made under subsection C1a at the centerline of the street.
    2. Where a minimum radial distance between each off-premises sign structure is established, the distance shall be calculated as follows:

        1. Draw a circle with its center on the centerline of the sign structure, and a radius equal to the minimum required distance (Exhibit 23.86.004 F).
        2. No off-premises sign except permitted business district identification signs shall be located within the circle.
        3. Double-face or "V" type billboards shall be considered one (1) structure for the purposes of this subsection.
        4. When permitted sign area is calculated as a percentage of the area of the face of the structure on which the sign is located, the area of the structure face shall be the elevation of the structure as measured on flat projection from any side, excluding the roof and excluding any chimney, stack, structure, or mechanical equipment on the roof.

#### 23.86.006 - Structure height measurement

![23-86-006-3.png](./images/23-86-006-3.png)

![23-86-006-4.png](./images/23-86-006-4.png)

![23-86-006-5.png](./images/23-86-006-5.png)


1. In all zones except downtown zones, and except for the Living Building Pilot Program authorized by Section 23.40.060, unless otherwise specified, the height of structures shall be measured according to this subsection 23.86.006.A.

    1. General rule. Except as otherwise specified, the height of a structure is the difference between the elevation of the highest point of the structure not excepted from applicable height limits and the average grade level. In this subsection 23.86.006.A, "average grade level" means the average of the elevation of existing lot grades. Except as provided in subsection 23.86.006.A.2, average grade level is calculated, at the discretion of the applicant, as follows:

        1. at the midpoint, measured horizontally, of each exterior wall of the structure, or
        2. at the midpoint of each side of the smallest rectangle that can be drawn to enclose the structure.
    2. Option for calculating average grade level to measure height. The calculation of structure height in subsection 23.86.006.A.1 may be modified, at the discretion of the applicant, as follows to permit the structure to respond to the topography of the lot:

        1. Draw the smallest rectangle that encloses the principal structure.
        2. Divide one side of the rectangle, chosen by the applicant, into sections at least 15 feet in length using lines that are perpendicular to the chosen side of the rectangle.
        3. The sections delineated in subsection 23.86.006.A.2.b are considered to extend vertically from the ground to the sky.
        4. The maximum height for each section of the structure is measured from the average grade level for that section of the structure, which is calculated as the average elevation of existing lot grades at the midpoints of the two opposing exterior sides of the rectangle for each section of the structure.
2. Within the South Lake Union Urban Center, at the applicant's option, structure height shall be measured either as provided for in subsection 23.86.006.A, 23.86.006.E, or under provisions of this subsection 23.86.006.B. Structure height shall be measured for all portions of the structure. All measurements shall be taken vertically from existing or finished grade, whichever is lower, to the highest point of the structure located directly above each point of measurement. Existing or finished grade shall be established by drawing straight lines between the corresponding elevations at the perimeter of the structure. The straight lines will be existing or finished grade for the purpose of height measurement. When a contour line crosses a facade more than once, that contour line will be disregarded when establishing existing or finished grade.
3. Height averaging for single-family zones. In a single-family zone, when expanding an existing structure occupied by a nonconforming residential use per Section 23.42.106, the following measurement shall be used to determine the average height of the closest principal structures on either side:

    1. Each structure used for averaging shall be on the same block front as the lot for which a height limit is being established. The structures used shall be the nearest single-family structure on each side of the lot, and shall be within 100 feet of the side lot lines of the lot.
    2. The height limit for the lot shall be established by averaging the elevations of the structures on either side in the following manner:

        1. If the nearest structure on either side has a roof with at least a 4:12 pitch, the elevation to be used for averaging shall be the highest point of that structure's roof minus 5 feet.
        2. If the nearest structure on either side has a flat roof, or a roof with a pitch of less than 4:12, the elevation of the highest point of the structure's roof shall be used for averaging.
        3. Rooftop features which are otherwise exempt from height limitations according to subsection 23.44.012.C, shall not be included in elevation calculations.
        4. The two elevations obtained from subsection 23.86.006.B.2.a and/or subsection 23.86.006.B.2.b shall be averaged to derive the height limit for the lot. This height limit shall be the difference in elevation between the midpoint of a line parallel to the front lot line at the required front setback and the average elevation derived from subsection 23.86.006.B.2.a and/or subsection 23.86.006.B.2.b.
        5. The height measurement technique used for the lot shall then be the City's standard measurement technique, subsection 23.86.006.A.
    3. If there is no single-family structure within 100 feet of a side lot line, or if the nearest single-family structure within 100 feet of a side lot line is not on the same block front, the elevation used for averaging on that side shall be 30 feet plus the elevation of the midpoint of the front lot line of the abutting vacant lot.
    4. If the lot is a corner lot, the height limit may be the highest elevation of the nearest structure on the same block front, provided that the structure is within 100 feet of the side lot line of the lot and that both front yards face the same street.
    5. In no case shall the height limit established according to these height averaging provisions be greater than 40 feet.
    6. Lots using height averaging to establish a height limit shall be eligible for the pitched roof provisions of subsection 23.44.012.B.
4. Stories or portions of stories of a structure that are underground are not analyzed for purposes of structure height measurement.
5. Height measurement techniques in downtown zones and in the South Lake Union Urban Center

    1. Determine the major street lot line, which shall be the lot's longest street lot line. When the lot has two or more street lot lines of equal length, the applicant shall choose the major street lot line.
    2. Determine the slope of the lot along the entire length of the major street lot line.
    3. The maximum height shall be measured as follows:

        1. When the slope of the major street lot line is less than or equal to 7.5 percent, the elevation of maximum height shall be determined by adding the maximum permitted height to the existing grade elevation at the midpoint of the major street lot line. On a through-lot, the elevation of maximum height shall apply only to the half of the lot nearest the major street lot line. On the other half of a through-lot, the elevation of maximum height shall be determined by the above method using the street lot line opposite and parallel to the major street lot line as depicted in Exhibit B for 23.86.006.
        2. When the slope of the major street lot line exceeds 7.5 percent, the major street lot line shall be divided into four or fewer equal segments no longer than 120 feet in length. The elevation of maximum height shall be determined by adding the maximum permitted height to the existing grade elevation at the midpoint of each segment. On a through-lot, the elevation of maximum height shall apply only to the half of the lot nearest the major street lot line. On the other half of a through-lot, the elevation of maximum height shall be determined by the above method using the street lot line opposite and parallel to the major street lot line, as depicted in Exhibit C for 23.86.006.
        3. For lots with more than one street frontage, where there is no street lot line that is essentially parallel to the major street lot line, when a measurement has been made for the portion of the block containing the major street lot line, the next measurement shall be taken from the longest remaining street lot line.
6. Determining the height of existing public school structures. When the height of the existing public school structure is measured for purposes of determining the permitted height or lot coverage of a public school structure, either of the following measurement methods may be used:

    1. If all parts of the new roof are pitched at a rate of not less than 4:12, the ridge of the new roof may extend to the highest point of the existing roof. A shed roof does not qualify for this option; or
    2. If all parts of the new roof are not pitched at a rate of not less than 4:12, then the elevation of the new construction may extend to the average height of the existing structure. The average height shall be determined by measuring the area of each portion of the building at each height and averaging those areas, as depicted in Exhibit D for 23.86.006.
7. Height measurement technique for structures located partially within the Shoreline District. When any portion of the structure falls within the Shoreline District, structure height for the entire structure shall be measured according to Section 23.60.952, Height.
8. For projects accepted into the Living Building Pilot Program authorized pursuant to Section 23.40.060, the applicant may choose either the height definition of Section 502 of the Seattle Building Code or the height measurement method described in this Section 23.86.006.

Exhibit C forLot Area Used to Calculate Gross Floor Area


1. Certain items may be exempted from calculation of gross floor area of a structure. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Title 23, if gross floor area of underground stories or portions of stories is exempted, the amount of below-grade gross floor area is measured as follows:

    1. An underground story is that story or portion of a story for which the ceiling above, or the roof surface if there is no next floor above, is at or below the abutting existing or finished grade, whichever is lower (See Exhibit A for 23.86.007).
    2. To determine the amount of gross floor area that is below grade:

        1. determine the elevation of the ceiling of the underground story, or the roof surface if there is no next floor above the underground story;
        2. determine the points along the exterior wall of the story where the ceiling elevation or roof surface elevation above intersects the abutting corresponding existing or finished grade elevation, whichever is lower;
        3. draw a straight line across the story connecting the two points on the exterior walls;
        4. the gross floor area of an underground story or portion of an underground story is the area that is at or below the straight line drawn in subsection 23.86.007.A.2.c above.
2. Pursuant to subsection 23.45.510.E, for certain structures in multifamily zones, portions of a story that extend no more than 4 feet above existing or finished grade, whichever is lower, are exempt from calculation of gross floor area. The exempt gross floor area of such partially below-grade stories is measured as follows:

    1. determine the elevation 4 feet below the ceiling of the partially below-grade story, or 4 feet below the roof surface if there is no next floor above the partially below-grade story;
    2. determine the points along the exterior wall of the story where the elevation determined in subsection 23.86.007.B.1 above intersects the abutting corresponding existing or finished grade elevation, whichever is lower;
    3. draw a straight line across the story connecting the two points on the exterior walls;
    4. the gross floor area of the partially below-grade story or portion of a partially below-grade story is the area of the story that is at or below the straight line drawn in subsection 23.86.007.B.3 above, excluding openings required by the Building Code for egress. (See Exhibit B for 23.86.007).
3. Public rights-of-way are not considered part of a lot when calculating FAR or gross floor area allowed for residential development not subject to FAR in a downtown or SM-SLU zone except that, if dedication of right-of-way is required as a condition of a proposed development, the area of dedicated right-of-way is included.
4. If a lot is in more than one zone, the FAR limit for each zone applies to the portion of the lot located in that zone.
5. In LR zones, if more than one category of residential use is located on a lot, the FAR limit for each category of residential use is based on each category's percentage of total structure footprint area, as follows:

    1. Calculate the footprint, in square feet, for each category of residential use. For purposes of this calculation, "footprint" is defined as the horizontal area enclosed by the exterior walls of the structure.
    2. Calculate the total square feet of footprint of all categories of residential uses on the lot.
    3. Divide the square footage of the footprint for each category of residential structure in subsection 23.86.007.E.1 above by the total square feet of footprints of all residential uses in subsection 23.86.007.E.2 above.
    4. Multiply the percentage calculated in subsection 23.86.007.E.3 for each housing category by the area of the lot. The result is the area of the lot devoted to each housing category.
    5. The FAR limit for each category of residential use is the applicable one for that use multiplied by the percentage calculated in subsection 23.86.007.E.4.
    6. If the FAR limit for all categories of residential use on the lot is the same, then the FAR limit is calculated as if there was only one category of residential use on the lot.
    7. FAR contained in structures built prior to January 1, 1982 as single-family dwelling units meeting the requirements of subsection 23.45.510.E.3 is not included in the calculation of the FAR limit.
6. In the SM-SLU zones, the lot area used to calculate the gross floor area (GFA) allowed for structures or portions of structures subject to an FAR limit on sites that include a residential tower shall be based on the area of the lot excluding the lot area required for tower development (see Exhibit C for 23.86.007) as follows:

1. Lot coverage shall be calculated in accordance with Exhibit 23.86.008 A.
2. In single-family zones, lot depth shall be the length of the line extending between the front lot line or front lot line extended, and the rear lot line or lines, or in the case of a through lot, between the two (2) front lot lines or lines extended. This line shall be perpendicular to the front lot line or front lot line extended. Where an alley abuts the rear of the property, one-half (½) of the width of the alley shall be included as a portion of the lot for determining lot depth.
3. Lot Width in Single-family Zones:

    1. When a lot is essentially rectangular, the lot width shall be the mean horizontal distance between side lot lines measured at right angles to lot depth (Exhibit 23.86.008 B).
    2. In the case of a lot with more than one (1) rear lot line (Exhibits 23.86.008 C and 23.86.008 D), the lot width shall be measured according to the following:

        1. If the distance between the rear lot lines is fifty (50) percent or less of the lot depth, the lot width shall be measured parallel to the front lot line and shall be the greatest distance between the side lot lines (Exhibit 23.86.008 C); or
        2. If the distance between the rear lot lines is greater than fifty (50) percent of the lot depth, the lot width shall be determined by measuring average lot width according to Exhibit 23.86.008 D.
    3. For irregular lots not meeting the conditions of subsections C1 or C2, the Director shall determine the measurement of lot width.

#### 23.86.010 - Yards

![23-86-010-1.png](./images/23-86-010-1.png)

![23-86-010-2.png](./images/23-86-010-2.png)

![23-86-010-5.png](./images/23-86-010-5.png)


1. Measuring required yards. Required yard dimensions shall be horizontal distances, measured perpendicular to the appropriate lot lines (Exhibit A for 23.86.010). For lots with no street frontage, the applicant may designate the front lot line, provided that under the resulting orientation, the area of the front yard is at least 20 percent of the area of the lot or 1,000 square feet whichever is less. If a lot with frontage on more than one street is developed with an existing principal structure, the orientation of the lot for the purpose of current yard requirements shall be the orientation under which the existing structure is most conforming to current yard standards.
2. Front Yards.

    1. Determining Front Yard Requirements. Front yard requirements are presented in the development standards for each zone. Where the minimum required front yard is to be determined by averaging the setbacks of structures on either side of a lot, the following provisions apply:

        1. The required depth of the front yard shall be the average of the distance between single-family structures and front lot lines of the nearest single-family structures on each side of the lot (Exhibit B for 23.86.010). If the front facade of the single-family structure is not parallel to the front lot line, the shortest distance from the front lot line to the structure shall be used for averaging purposes (Exhibit C for 23.86.010).
        2. The yards used for front yard averaging shall be on the same block front as the lot, and shall be the front yards of the nearest single-family structures within 100 feet of the side lot lines of the lot.
        3. For averaging purposes, front yard depth shall be measured from the front lot lines to the wall nearest to the street or, where there is no wall, the plane between supports, which comprises 20 percent or more of the width of the front facade of the single-family structure. Enclosed porches shall be considered part of the single-family structure for measurement purposes. Attached garages or carports permitted in front yards under 23.44.016.D, decks, uncovered porches, eaves, attached solar collectors, and other similar parts of the structure shall not be considered part of the structure for measurement purposes.
        4. If there is a dedication of street right-of-way to bring the street abutting the lot closer to the minimum widths established in Section 23.53.015, for averaging purposes the amount of the dedication shall be subtracted from the front yard depth of the structures on either side.
        5. If the first single-family structure within 100 feet of a side lot line of the lot is not on the same block front, or does not provide its front yard on the same street, or if there is no single-family structure within 100 feet of the side lot line, the yard depth used for averaging purposes on that side shall be 20 feet (Exhibits D and E for 23.86.010).
        6. If the front yard of the first single-family structure within 100 feet of the side lot line of the lot exceeds 20 feet, the yard depth used for averaging purposes on that side shall be 20 feet (Exhibit F for 23.86.010).
        7. In cases where the street is very steep or winding, the Director shall determine which adjacent single-family structures should be used for averaging purposes.
    2. Sloped Lots in Single-family Zones. For a lot in a single-family zone, reduction of the required front yard is permitted at a rate of 1 foot for every percent of slope in excess of 35 percent. For the purpose of this provision the slope shall be measured along the centerline of the lot. In the case of irregularly shaped lots, the Director shall determine the line along which slope is calculated.
3. Rear yards. Rear yard requirements are presented in the standard development requirements for each zone. In determining how to apply these requirements, the following provisions shall apply:

    1. The rear yard shall be measured horizontally from the rear lot line if the lot has a rear lot line that is essentially parallel to the front lot line for its entire length.
    2. If the front lot line is essentially parallel to portions of the rear property line, as with a stepped rear property line, each portion of the rear property line that is opposite and essentially parallel to the front lot line is considered to be a rear lot line for the purpose of establishing a rear yard.
    3. On a lot with a rear property line, part of which is not essentially parallel to any part of the front lot line, the rear yard is measured from a line or lines drawn from side lot line(s) to side lot line(s), at least 10 feet in length, parallel to and at a maximum distance from the front lot line. If an alley abuts the rear of the property, 1/2 the width of the alley, between the side lot lines extended, is considered to be part of the lot for drawing this line. For those portions of the rear lot line that are essentially parallel to the front lot line, subsection 23.86.010.C.2 above shall apply. The lot depth is then measured perpendicularly from this 10 foot long line extended as needed to the point on the actual front lot line that is the furthest distance away. This establishes lot depth, which then may be used to determine the required rear yard depth.
    4. For a lot with a curved front lot line, the rear yard is measured from a line at least 10 feet in length, parallel to and at a maximum distance from a line drawn between the endpoints of the curve. The lot depth is then measured perpendicularly from this 10 foot long line extended as needed to the point on the actual front lot line that is the furthest distance away. This establishes lot depth, which then may be used to determine the required rear yard depth.
    5. For a lot with an irregular shape or with an irregular front lot line not meeting conditions of subsections 23.86.010.C.1 through 23.86.010.C.4, the Director shall determine the measurement of the rear yard.
4. Side Yards.

    1. Side Yard Averaging. Side yard requirements are presented in the standard development requirements for each zone. In certain cases where specifically permitted, the side yard requirement may be satisfied by averaging the distance from side lot line to structure facade for the length of the structure. In those cases the side yard shall be measured horizontally from side lot line to the side facade of the structure.

#### 23.86.012 - Multifamily zone setback measurement

![23-86-012-1.png](./images/23-86-012-1.png)


1. If the first principal structure within 100 feet of a side lot line of the subject lot is not on the same block front or there is no principal structure within 100 feet of the side lot line, the setback depth used for averaging purposes on that side is 7 feet.
2. For averaging purposes, the front setback is the shortest distance from the front lot line to the nearest wall or, where there is no wall, the plane between supports that span 20 percent or more of the width of the front facade of the principal structure. Attached garages and enclosed porches are considered part of the principal structure for measurement purposes. Decks less than 18 inches above existing grade, uncovered porches, eaves, attached solar collectors and other similar parts of the structure are not considered part of the principal structure.
3. If there is a dedication of street right-of-way to bring the street abutting the lot closer to the minimum widths established in Section 23.53.015, for averaging purposes the amount of dedication is subtracted from the front setbacks of the structures on either side.
4. If the front setback of the first principal structure within 100 feet of the side lot line of the subject lot exceeds 20 feet, the setback depth used for averaging purposes on that side is 20 feet.
5. In cases where the street is very steep or winding, the Director will determine which adjacent structures should be used for averaging purposes.
6. In the case of a through lot, the front setback is determined independently for each street frontage. The measurement techniques of this section 23.86.012 apply to each street frontage separately.
7. For multiple structures on the same lot, the front setback of a principal structure on the same lot may be used for averaging purposes.

1. Setback averaging. In multifamily zones, certain required setbacks may be averaged. In such cases the following provisions apply:

    1. The average front and rear setbacks are calculated based on the entire width of the structure;
    2. The average side setbacks are calculated based on the entire depth of the structure;
    3. Setbacks are measured horizontally from the lot line to the facade of the structure. The facade(s) used in calculating the average and minimum setback requirements shall be those facades that are nearest to that lot line except that any features allowed to project into the setback are excluded.
2. Determining front setbacks for institutions. In LR zones, the minimum required front setback for institutions is determined by averaging the setbacks of structures on either side of the subject lot, as follows:

    1. The required front setback is the average of the distances between principal structures and front lot lines of the nearest principal structures on each side of the subject lot if each of those structures is on the same block front as the subject lot and is within 100 feet of the side lot lines of the subject lot (Exhibit A for 23.86.012).

![23-86-015-2.png](./images/23-86-015-2.png)


1. In Lowrise zones, the length of certain facades is limited by development standards. Facade length is measured as follows:

    1. Draw a line parallel to, and 15 feet from, the lot line along which the length of a facade is limited.
    2. For each portion of a structure that located between the line drawn in subsection 23.86.015.A.1 and the lot line, mark the points at which that portion of the structure crosses the line drawn in subsection 23.86.015.A.1, and measure the distance between those points.
    3. The facade length limit applies to the sum of the lengths of the portions of structure(s) measured in subsection 23.86.015.A.2 (see Exhibit A and Exhibit B for 23.86.015).
2. Portions of a structure that are included in façade length measurement include:

Exhibit A forStructure depth


1. If more than one structure is located on a lot and no portion of a structure is behind any portion of another structure and the structures are separated by a minimum of 10 feet, the maximum depth of each structure shall be measured individually (See Exhibit B for 23.86.016). If any portion of a structure is behind any portion of another structure then the structure depth shall be measured as the combined depth of the principal structures on the lot.
![23-86-016-B.png](./images/23-86-016-B.png)


Exhibit B forDepth measurement for offset structures

![23-86-016-3.png](./images/23-86-016-3.png)

1. Structure depth is measured as follows:

    1. Draw the smallest rectangle that encloses a principal structure.
    2. Structure depth is the length of the sides of that rectangle most closely parallel to the side lot lines (Exhibit A for 23.86.016).
2. Portions of a structure considered part of the principal structure for the purpose of measuring structure depth are as follows:

    1. Carports and garages attached to the principal structure, unless they are attached by a structural feature not counted in structure depth under subsection 23.86.016.C;
    2. Accessory structures, other than carports and garages, that are not listed in subsection 23.86.016.C, if they are less than 3 feet from the principal structure at any point;
    3. Exterior corridors, hallways, and open, above grade walkways;
    4. Enclosed porches, decks, balconies and other enclosed projections, except as provided in subsection 23.43.008.C; and
    5. Projecting segments of a facade unless they are not counted in structure depth in subsection 23.86.016.C.
3. Portions of a structure that are not considered part of the principal structure for the purpose of measuring structure depth are as follows:

    6. In Lowrise 3 zones in the Northgate Overlay District, portions of a structure that are exempt from FAR limits pursuant to subsection 23.45.510.E.5.
4. Determining lot depth. If development standards are based on lot depth, lot depth is determined as follows:

    1. If the lot is essentially rectangular and has a rear lot line within 15 degrees of parallel to the front lot line, the lot depth is the horizontal distance between the midpoints of the front and rear lot lines (Exhibit C for 23.86.016).
    2. If the lot is triangular or wedge-shaped, lot depth shall be the horizontal distance between the midpoint of the front lot line and the rear point of the lot. If the lot does not actually come to a point, lot depth is measured from midpoint of the front lot line to the midpoint of the rear lot line.
    3. In the case of a through lot, lot depth is measured between the midpoint of each front lot line.
    4. When lot shape is so irregular that subsections 23.86.016.D.1, 23.86.016.D.2 or 23.86.016.D.3 cannot be used, lot depth is the distance equal to the result of lot area divided by length of front lot line, provided that in no case is the depth permitted to be greater than the distance from front lot line to the furthest point on the perimeter of the lot.

#### 23.86.017 - Amenity area measurement

Certain zones require a minimum amount of amenity area to be provided on the lot. If amenity area is required, the following provisions shall apply:


1. If the applicable development standards specify a minimum contiguous amenity area, areas smaller than the minimum contiguous area are not be counted toward fulfilling amenity area requirements.

    1. Driveways and vehicular access easements, whether paved or unpaved, shall be considered to separate the amenity areas they bisect, except for woonerfs permitted to qualify as required amenity area.
    2. Pedestrian access areas shall not be considered to break the contiguity of amenity area on each side.
2. In shoreline areas, when determining the amount of amenity area required or provided, no land waterward of the ordinary high water mark shall be included in the calculation.
3. In cases where the shape or configuration of the amenity area is irregular or unusual, the Director shall determine whether amenity area requirements have been met, notwithstanding the following provisions, based on whether the proposed configuration would result in amenity area that is truly usable for normal residential recreational purposes. For the purpose of measuring the minimum horizontal dimension of the amenity area, if one is specified, the following provisions shall apply:

    1. For rectangular or square areas, each exterior dimension of the area shall meet the minimum dimension (Exhibit A for 23.86.017).
![23-86-017-1.png](./images/23-86-017-1.png)


Exhibit A for: Measurement of Regular Amenity Area


1. For circular areas, the diameter of the circle shall meet the minimum dimension; for semicircular areas, the radius of the area shall meet the minimum dimension (Exhibit B for 23.86.017).
![23-86-017-2.png](./images/23-86-017-2.png)


Exhibit B for: Measurement of Circular Amenity Areas


#### 23.86.018 - Open space.

Certain zones require a minimum amount of open space to be provided on the lot. For those cases where open space is required, the following provisions shall apply:

![23-86-018-1.png](./images/23-86-018-1.png)

![23-86-018-2.png](./images/23-86-018-2.png)

![23-86-018-3.png](./images/23-86-018-3.png)

![23-86-018-4.png](./images/23-86-018-4.png)


1. In order for a portion of a lot to qualify as open space, the ground's surface shall be permeable, except for patios, paved areas designed for recreation, and pedestrian access which meets the Washington State Rules and Regulations for Barrier-Free Design. The area shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, bushes and/or trees.
2. Driveways, parking areas and pedestrian access, except for pedestrian access meeting the Washington State Rules and Regulations for Barrier-Free Design, shall not be counted as open space.
3. The area covered or enclosed by solar collectors meeting minimum standards administered by the Director may be counted as required open space.
4. Portions of a structure which begin eight (8) feet or more above finished grade may project up to four (4) feet over required ground-level open space.
5. Development standards for certain zones specify a minimum contiguous area for open space. Open space areas smaller than the minimum contiguous area specified for such zones shall not be counted toward fulfilling total open space requirements for that lot.

    1. Driveways and parking areas, paved or unpaved, shall be considered to separate open space areas they bisect.
    2. Pedestrian access areas shall not be considered to break the contiguity of open space on each side.
6. In shoreline areas, when determining the amount of open space required or provided, no land waterward of the ordinary high water mark shall be included in the calculation.
7. In order for a ground area, roof area, deck or balcony to be considered as open space, it shall have a minimum area and provide a minimum horizontal dimension as established in each zone. In cases where the shape or configuration of the open space is irregular or unusual, the Director shall determine whether open space requirements have been met, notwithstanding the following provisions, based on whether the proposed configuration would result in open space that is truly usable for normal residential open space purposes. For the purpose of measuring the horizontal dimensions of open space, the following provisions shall apply:

    1. For rectangular or square areas, each exterior dimension of the area shall meet the minimum dimension (Exhibit 23.86.018 A).
    2. For irregularly shaped areas where all lines intersect at or approximately at ninety (90) degree angles, an area which is not less than sixty (60) percent of the minimum dimension in width and does not extend further than sixty (60) percent of the minimum dimension from a contiguous rectangular or square area of which all sides meet or exceed the minimum dimension, may be included as required open space (Exhibit 23.86.018 B).
    3. For triangular areas, all exterior dimensions of the area shall meet or exceed the minimum dimensions (Exhibit 23.86.018 C).
    4. For circular areas, the diameter of the circle shall meet the minimum dimension; for semicircular areas, the radius of the area shall meet the minimum dimension (Exhibit 23.86.018 D).
8. In the case of a lot where a portion is reserved as a vehicular access easement to another lot, when determining the amount of open space required or provided, no land within the limits of the easement shall be included in the calculation except where a portion of the structure is constructed over the easement.

1. Development standards for certain areas require landscaping that meets a minimum Green Factor score. All required landscaping shall meet standards promulgated by the Director to provide for the long-term health, viability, and coverage of plantings. These standards may include, but are not limited to, the type and size of plants, spacing of plants, depth and quality of soil, use of drought-tolerant plants, and access to light and air for plants. The Green Factor score shall be calculated as follows:

    1. Identify all proposed landscape elements, sorted into the categories presented in Table A for Section 23.86.019.
    2. Multiply the square feet, or equivalent square footage where applicable, of each landscape element by the multiplier provided for that element in Table A for Section 23.86.019, according to the following provisions:

        1. If multiple elements listed on Table A for Section 23.86.019 occupy the same area (for example, groundcover under a tree), count the full square footage or equivalent square footage of each element.
        2. Landscaping elements in the right-of-way between the lot line and the roadway may be counted, provided that they are approved by the Director of the Department of Transportation.
        3. Elements listed in Table A for Section 23.86.019 that are provided to satisfy any other requirements of this Code may be counted.
        4. For trees, large shrubs, and large perennials, use the equivalent square footage of each tree or shrub according to Table B for Section 23.86.019.
        5. For vegetated walls, use the square footage of the portion of the wall covered by vegetation. All vegetated wall structures, including fences counted as vegetated walls, shall be constructed of durable materials, provide adequate planting area for plant health, and provide appropriate surfaces or structures that enable plant coverage.
        6. For all elements other than trees, large shrubs, large perennials, and vegetated walls, square footage is determined by the area of the portion of a horizontal plane that lies over or under the element.
        7. All permeable paving and structural soil credits together may not count for more than one third of the lot's Green Factor score.
    3. Add together all the products calculated under subsection 23.86.019.A.2 to determine the Green Factor numerator.
    4. Divide the Green Factor numerator by the lot area to determine the Green Factor score.

#### 23.86.023 - Street-level facades.

A structure's street-level facade is the portion of the facade that covers the street-level story or stories of a structure along an abutting street. The street-level facade of a structure is measured independently along each abutting street. On flat or sloped streets that span only one story of a structure, the street-level facade is the exterior wall of the story with more than fifty (50) percent of its floor closer to street level than any other story. On sloped streets that span more than one story of a structure, the street-level facade is identified as covering that portion of each story with its floor closer to street level than the floor of any other story. If no floor is closer to street-level than any other floor, the Director shall determine which portion of the facade is the street level. (Exhibit 23.86.023 A).

In zones where a certain percentage of the street-facing facade is required to be transparent, transparency shall be measured in an area between 2 feet and 8 feet above the elevation of the lot line at the sidewalk, as depicted in Exhibit A for 23.86.026, unless a different area is specified in the development standards applicable to the lot. Areaways, stairways, and other excavations at the lot line shall not be considered in measuring the elevation of the street lot line. When sidewalk widening is required according to Section 23.49.022, the elevation of the lines establishing the new sidewalk width shall be used rather than the street lot line.
2. When transparency is required for facades that abut bonused public open spaces, the measurement of facade transparency shall be from the elevation of the public open space.
3. The full length of landmark designated structures, and character structures retained according to Section 23.73.015, shall not be counted in determining the required transparency.

#### 23.86.028 - Blank facades

In zones where blank facades are required to be limited, the following provisions shall be used to determine the percent and length of blank facades.

![23-86-030-2.png](./images/23-86-030-2.png)

![23-86-030-3.png](./images/23-86-030-3.png)


1. An outdoor area that is not part of a green street or publicly owned open space qualifies as a common recreation area if the ground surface of the area is permeable and is landscaped with grass, ground cover, bushes and/or trees; provided that patios, paved areas designed for recreation, and pedestrian access that meets the Washington State Rules for Barrier-Free Design shall also be considered common recreation area.
2. Driveways, parking areas and pedestrian access, except for pedestrian access meeting the Washington State Rules and Regulations for Barrier-Free Design, shall not be counted as common recreation area.
3. Development standards in downtown zones specify a minimum contiguous area for common recreation area. Areas smaller than the minimum contiguous area specified shall not be counted toward fulfilling the common recreation area requirements. Driveways and parking areas, paved or unpaved, shall be considered to separate common recreation areas they bisect. Pedestrian access areas shall not be considered to break the contiguity of common recreation areas on each side.
4. For an area to be considered a common recreation area, it must have a minimum area and minimum horizontal dimensions as established for downtown zones. For the purpose of measuring the horizontal dimensions of the common recreation area, the following provisions shall apply:

    1. In rectangular or square areas, each exterior dimension of the area shall meet the minimum dimension as depicted in Exhibit 23.86.030 A.
    2. In irregularly shaped areas in which all lines intersect at or approximately at ninety (90) degree angles, an area which is not less than sixty (60) percent of the minimum dimension in width and does not extend further than sixty (60) percent of the minimum dimension form a contiguous rectangular or square area of which all sides meet or exceed the minimum dimension, may be included as required common recreation area, as depicted in Exhibit 23.86.030 B.

    4. In circular areas, the diameter of the circle shall meet the minimum dimension; for semicircular areas, the radius of the area shall meet the minimum dimension as depicted in Exhibit 23.86.030 D.
    5. When the shape of the area is so unusual that the above provisions cannot be applied; for example, when the shape is curvilinear, the Director shall determine when common recreation area requirements have been met.
    6. When a portion of a lot is reserved for a vehicular access easement to another lot, no land within the limits of the easement shall be included in the calculation of the common recreation area required, except when a portion of the structure containing common recreation area is constructed over the easement.

#### 23.86.032 - Gross floor area in residential use.

When a requirement is based on the percentage of a structure's gross floor area which is in residential use, residential area shall include the following:


1. The gross floor area of all floors or portions of floors of a structure which are devoted entirely to residential use;
2. The prorated portion share of a structure's common areas in the same proportion as the residential use to other uses occupying the structure.

#### 23.86.034 - Distance to required parking.

When a maximum distance to required parking is specified it shall be the walking distance measured from the nearest point of the parking area or garage to the nearest point of the lot containing the use the parking is required to serve.


#### 23.86.036 - Major Institution minimum site and gross floor area measurement.

1. For the purpose of determining whether an institution's site meets the minimum site area to be designated a Major Institution, the following shall be included:

    1. All contiguous lots containing Major Institution uses, and lots abutting or across a street or alley and within a radius of two thousand five hundred feet (2,500') of the contiguous lots containing Major Institution uses, including parking lots and outdoor uses and activity areas such as ball courts and playfields primarily used by the Major Institution;
    2. If a structure on a lot contains uses other than Major Institution uses, only the area of the lot which contains Major Institution uses or the respective lot area calculated as a percentage of the structure that is occupied by the Major Institution use(s) shall be included.
2. For the purposes of determining whether an institution's gross floor area meets the minimum required to be designated a Major Institution, all gross floor area containing Major Institution uses in all structures within a Major Institution's site area, as determined by subsection A of this section, shall be included.


### Division 3 - Implementation

### Chapter 23.88 - RULES; INTERPRETATION

Sections:

#### 23.88.010 - Rulemaking

1. The Director may promulgate rules consistent with this Title 23 pursuant to the authority granted in Section 3.06.040 and pursuant to the procedures established for rulemaking in the Administrative Code, Chapter 3.02. In addition to the notice provisions of Chapter 3.02, notice of the proposed adoption of a rule shall be placed in the Land Use Information Bulletin.
2. The Director may adopt and amend, by rule, performance standards for determining whether a proposed new structure has earned, at a minimum, a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating, a Built Green 4-star rating of the Master Builders Association of King and Snohomish Counties, or meets the Washington Evergreen Sustainable Development Standards (ESDS). No rule may assign authority for making a final determination of whether a proposed new structure has earned, at a minimum, a LEED Silver rating, a Built Green 4-star rating of the Master Builders Association of King and Snohomish Counties, or meets the Washington Evergreen Sustainable Development Standards (ESDS) to any person other than an officer of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections or another City agency with regulatory authority and expertise in green building practices.

#### 23.88.020 - Land use interpretations

The provisions of subsections 23.88.020.D, 23.88.020.E and 23.88.020.F shall not apply to interpretations requested pursuant to this subsection 23.88.020.C.3.c. The Director shall respond to the request by issuing an interpretation in the form of a memorandum to be filed with the Hearing Examiner at least five calendar days before the hearing.


1. Interpretations generally. A decision by the Director as to the meaning, application or intent of any development regulation in Title 23 or in Chapter 25.09, Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas, as it relates to a specific property, or a decision by the Director upon review of a determination of consistency of a proposed project with a planned action ordinance, is known as an "interpretation." An interpretation may be requested in writing by any person or may be initiated by the Director. Procedural provisions and statements of policy are not subject to the interpretation process. A decision by the Director that an issue is not subject to an interpretation request is final and not subject to administrative appeal. A request for an interpretation, and a subsequent appeal to the Hearing Examiner if available, are administrative remedies that must be exhausted before judicial review of a decision subject to interpretation may be sought. An interpretation decision by the Director may affirm, reverse, or modify all or any portion of a Type I or Type II land use decision.
2. Filing and Fees. Any request for interpretation shall be filed with the Director accompanied by the required fee. If a request for interpretation is included in an appeal to the Hearing Examiner of a related project decision, a copy shall be filed with the Director, accompanied by the applicable fee.
3. Timing of request

    1. An interpretation that is not related to any pending project application may be requested at any time, by any person.
    2. If an interpretation relates to a project application requiring no public notice pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, the following rules govern the deadline by which the request for interpretation shall be received by the Department in order for the interpretation to be applied to the pending permit application:

        1. Any person may request an interpretation within 14 days after the date the project application is determined to be complete, provided that the interpretation will not apply to the project if the permit is ready to issue before or on the same day the interpretation request and fee are submitted to the Department.
        2. The project applicant may request an interpretation more than 14 days after the project application is determined to be complete if he or she agrees in writing that the time limits required by Section 23.76.005 shall be calculated from the day the interpretation is requested.
    3. If an interpretation relates to a project application requiring public notice pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 23.76, the following rules govern the deadline by which the request for interpretation shall be received by the Department in order for the interpretation to be applied to the pending permit application:

        1. Any person may request an interpretation prior to the end of the public comment period, including any extension, for the project application.
        2. The project applicant may request an interpretation after the end of the public comment period and prior to publication of a land use decision or recommendation, if he or she agrees in writing that the time limits required by Section 23.76.005 shall be calculated from the day the interpretation is requested.
        3. Notwithstanding the above deadlines, an appeal of a Type II decision to the Hearing Examiner or a request for further consideration of a Type III recommendation may include a request that the Director issue in writing an interpretation of specified code sections, combined with an appeal of such interpretation, provided that an interpretation regarding whether a use proposed under the related project application has been correctly classified may not be requested pursuant to this subsection 23.88.020.C.3.c. A request for interpretation made pursuant to this subsection 23.88.020.C.3.c shall state with specificity:

            1. How the Director's construction or application of the specified code sections is in error; and
            2. How the requester believes those sections should be construed or applied.
4. Notice of request for interpretation. If an interpretation relates to a project application under consideration, and is requested by a person other than the applicant for that project, notice of the request for interpretation shall be provided to the permit applicant. If an interpretation relates to the provisions of Chapter 23.60 (Seattle Shoreline Master Program), notice of the request shall be provided to the Washington State Department of Ecology. If an interpretation is requested by a Major Institution as to whether a proposal constitutes a major or minor amendment to an adopted Major Institution Master Plan, notice of the request shall be provided to all members of the Citizens' Advisory Committee for that Major Institution.
5. Notice of interpretation. Notice of an interpretation shall be provided to the person requesting the interpretation, and to the applicant(s) for the specific project or projects to which the interpretation relates. If the interpretation relates to provisions of Chapter 23.60 (Seattle Shoreline Master Program), notice shall be provided to the Washington State Department of Ecology. If the interpretation is related to a project requiring public notice, the interpretation shall be published concurrently with other land use decisions relating to that project. Notice of any interpretation subject to appeal before the Hearing Examiner shall be provided by Land Use Information Bulletin.

    1. An interpretation that is unrelated to any specific project application, or is related to a Type III or IV decision, may be appealed by any person to the Hearing Examiner. Such an appeal shall be filed with the Hearing Examiner by 5 p.m. on the 14 calendar day following publication of the notice of the interpretation. If the last day of the appeal period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until 5 p.m. on the next business day. The appeal hearing on an interpretation related to a Type III Master Use Permit shall be consolidated with the open record hearing on the project application and the appeal hearing for any related environmental determination. Interpretations related to Type IV decisions shall be appealable to the Hearing Examiner in accordance with Section 23.76.052.
    2. An interpretation relating to a project application that does not require public notice shall not be subject to administrative appeal.
    3. An interpretation relating to a Type II Master Use Permit decision that is appealable to the Hearing Examiner shall be subject to the same appeal deadline as the related project decision, and may be appealed only if that project decision is appealed. The appeal of an interpretation shall be consolidated with the appeal of the related project decision.
7. Appeals to Hearing Examiner, process and standard of review

    1. The appeal of an interpretation, where permitted, shall be in writing and shall state specifically why the applicant believes the interpretation to be incorrect.
    2. Appeals submitted to the Hearing Examiner shall be accompanied by payment of a filing fee as established in SMC Chapter 3.02.
    3. The Hearing Examiner shall consider the appeal in accordance with the procedure established for hearing contested cases in the Administrative Code, Chapter 3.02 and the Hearing Examiner Rules of Practice and Procedure in effect at the time the appeal is made.
    4. In the event of an appeal of an interpretation not related to a specific project application, such appeal shall be decided within fifteen (15) days of the close of the record before the Hearing Examiner.
    5. Appeals shall be considered de novo, and the decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be made upon the same basis as was required of the Director. The interpretation of the Director shall be given substantial weight, and the burden of establishing the contrary shall be upon the appellant. The Hearing Examiner shall summarily dismiss an appeal without hearing which is determined to be without merit on its face, frivolous, or brought merely to secure a delay.
    6. The Hearing Examiner may affirm, reverse or modify the Director's interpretation either in whole or in part or may remand the interpretation to the Director for further consideration. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final and conclusive unless the decision is reversed or remanded on judicial appeal. Any judicial review must be commenced as provided by state law.

3. The Land Use Code shall be enforced for the benefit of the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and not for the benefit of any particular person or class of persons.
4. It is the intent of this Land Use Code to place the obligation of complying with its requirements upon the owner, occupier or other person responsible for the condition of the land and buildings within the scope of this Code.
5. No provision of or term used in this Code is intended to impose any duty upon the City or any of its officers or employees which would subject them to damages in a civil action.

#### 23.90.006 - Investigation and notice of violation

1. The Director is authorized to investigate any structure or use the Director reasonably believes does not comply with the standards and requirements of this Land Use Code.
2. If after investigation the Director determines that the standards or requirements have been violated, the Director may issue a notice of violation to the owner, tenant or other person responsible for the condition. The notice of violation shall state separately each standard or requirement violated, shall state what corrective action, if any, is necessary to comply with the standards or requirements, and shall set a reasonable time for compliance. In the event of violations of the standards or requirements of Chapter 23.60A, Shoreline District, the required corrective action shall include, if appropriate, but shall not be limited to, mitigating measures such as restoration of the area.
3. The notice shall be served upon the owner, tenant or other person responsible for the condition by personal service, or by first class mail to the person's last known address. If the address of the responsible person is unknown and cannot be found after a reasonable search, the notice may be served by posting a copy of the notice at a conspicuous place on the property.

#### 23.90.008 - Time to comply.

When calculating a reasonable time for compliance as required by Section 23.90.006, the Director shall consider the following criteria:

4. The complexity of the corrective action, including seasonal considerations, construction requirements and the legal prerogatives of landlords and tenants; and
5. Any other circumstances beyond the control of the responsible party.

#### 23.90.010 - Stop Work Order.

Whenever a continuing violation of this Code will materially impair the Director's ability to secure compliance with this Code, or when the continuing violation threatens the health or safety of the public, the Director may issue a Stop Work Order specifying the violation and prohibiting any work or other activity at the site. A failure to comply with a Stop Work Order shall constitute a violation of this Land Use Code.


#### 23.90.012 - Emergency Order.

Whenever any use or activity in violation of this Code threatens the health and safety of the occupants of the premises or any member of the public, the Director may issue an Emergency Order directing that the use or activity be discontinued and the condition causing the threat to the public health and safety be corrected. The Emergency Order shall specify the time for compliance and shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the property, if posting is physically possible. A failure to comply with an Emergency Order shall constitute a violation of this Land Use Code.

Any condition described in the Emergency Order which is not corrected within the time specified is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and the Director is authorized to abate such nuisance summarily by such means as may be available. The cost of such abatement shall be recovered from the owner or person responsible or both in the manner provided by law.


#### 23.90.014 - Review by the Director.

1. Any person significantly affected by or interested in a notice of violation issued by the Director pursuant to Section 23.90.006 may obtain a review of the notice by requesting such review within ten (10) days after service of the notice. When the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until five (5:00) p.m. on the next business day. The request shall be in writing, and upon receipt of the request, the Director shall notify any persons served the notice of violation and the complainant, if any, of the request for review and the deadline for submitting additional information for the review. Additional information shall be submitted to the Director no later than fifteen (15) days after the notice of a request for a review is mailed, unless otherwise agreed by all persons served with the notice of violation. Before the deadline for submission of additional information, any person significantly affected by or interested in the notice of violation (including any persons served the notice of violation and the complainant) may submit any additional information in the form of written material or oral comments to the Director for consideration as part of the review.
2. The review will be made by a representative of the Director who is familiar with the case and the applicable ordinances. The Director's representative will review all additional information received by the deadline for submission of additional information. The reviewer may also request clarification of information received and a site visit. After review of the additional information, the Director may:

    1. Sustain the notice of violation;
    2. Withdraw the notice of violation;
    3. Continue the review to a date certain for receipt of additional information; or
    4. Modify the notice of violation, which may include an extension of the compliance date.

2. Unless a request for review before the Director is made pursuant to Section 23.90.014, the notice of violation shall become the order of the Director.
3. Because civil actions to enforce Title 23 SMC are brought in Seattle Municipal Court pursuant to Section 23.90.018, orders of the Director issued under this chapter are not subject to judicial review pursuant to chapter 36.70C RCW.

#### 23.90.016 - Extension of compliance date.

The Director may grant an extension of time for compliance with any notice or Order, whether pending or final, upon the Director's finding that substantial progress toward compliance has been made and that the public will not be adversely affected by the extension.

An extension of time may be revoked by the Director if it is shown that the conditions at the time the extension was granted have changed, the Director determines that a party is not performing corrective actions as agreed, or if the extension creates an adverse effect on the public. The date of revocation shall then be considered as the compliance date. The procedures for revocation, notification of parties, and appeal of the revocation shall be established by Rule.


#### 23.90.018 - Civil enforcement proceedings and penalties

where:


P is the penalty;

SF is the total square footage of the structure for which the demolition permit was issued; and

where:


P is the penalty;

CV is the Construction Value as set forth on the building permit for the new structure.


1. Failure to comply with the applicant's commitment to meet green building performance requirements is a violation of the Land Use Code independent of the failure to demonstrate compliance; however, such violation shall not affect the right to occupy any chargeable floor area, and if a penalty is paid in the amount determined under subsection 23.90.018.E.2, no additional penalty shall be imposed for the failure to comply with the commitment.
2. If the Director determines that the report submitted provides satisfactory evidence that the applicant's commitment is satisfied, the Director shall issue a certificate to the applicant so stating.
