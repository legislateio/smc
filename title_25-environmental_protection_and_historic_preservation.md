### 25.02.035 - Applicability.

1. General Rule. The provisions of this chapter apply to all affected employers within the City of Seattle. Construction worksites, when the expected duration of the construction project is less than two (2) years, are excluded. It is the responsibility of the employer to notify the Seattle Department of Transportation (Department) of a change in status pursuant to subsection B of this section.
2. Change in Status.

    1. From Affected to Unaffected Employer. If a previously affected employer no longer employs one hundred (100) or more affected employees and expects not to employ one hundred (100) or more affected employees for the next twelve (12) months, the City shall consider that employer no longer to be an affected employer beginning thirty (30) days after the employer provides written notice to the Department of its change in status.

        1. If the same employer returns to the level of one hundred (100) or more affected employees within the same twelve (12) month period, that employer will be considered an affected employer for the entire twelve (12) month period and will be subject to the same program requirements as other affected employers.
        2. If the same employer returns to the level of one hundred (100) or more affected employees more than twelve (12) months after changing from an affected employer to an unaffected employer, that employer shall be considered an affected employer beginning thirty (30) days after its return to affected status or January 1 of the following calendar year, whichever is earlier.
    2. From Unaffected Employer to Affected Employer. An employer meeting the definition of "affected employer" shall provide written notification to the City within 30 days of either moving within the City boundaries or growing in employment at a worksite to one hundred (100) or more affected employees.
3. Multi-Jurisdictional Worksites. An affected employer that has a work site located in both the City of Seattle and another incorporated or unincorporated jurisdiction with common borders or related regional issues may jointly, with one of those jurisdictions, petition the Department in writing at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to submittal of the affected employer's CTR program description or report to request that the affected employer be allowed to report to, and be governed by, the applicable commute trip reduction laws and regulations of the other jurisdiction. If such request is granted, the approval to report to and be governed by the applicable commute trip reduction laws and regulations of the other jurisdiction remains in effect so long as the Department receives copies of the affected employer's CTR program and reports submitted to the other jurisdiction and of any administrative decisions or actions taken by the jurisdiction or its agents in regard to the affected employer.
4. Growth and Transportation Efficiency Centers. Affected employers located within a designated growth and transportation efficiency center (GTEC) are subject to the requirements of this chapter, except where otherwise provided by administrative rule adopted pursuant to Section 25.02.100 B.

### 25.02.040 - Employer's baseline measurement and initial commute trip reduction program.

1. Baseline Measurement. An affected employer shall complete a baseline survey of employee commuting patterns in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.

    1. Preparation Deadline.

        1. After becoming an affected employer, an affected employer that has not adopted an approved CTR program shall conduct its baseline measurements on or before the later of the following dates:

            1. ninety (90) days after the effective date of the ordinance introduced as Council Bill 116332, if the employer is an affected employer on that date; or
            2. ninety (90) days after issuance of the affected employer's business license, or renewal thereof, if the employer becomes an affected employer after the effective date of the ordinance.
        2. An affected employer may request an extension of up to one hundred eighty (180) days. The Director shall grant all or part of the extension request or shall deny the request within ten (10) days of receipt a written request for extension. If the Director fails to respond within ten days, the extension is automatically granted for thirty (30) calendar days.
    2. Contents of Baseline Measurement. An affected employer's baseline measurement shall consist of survey data of affected employee commuting patterns, which shall be the primary source of data for measuring CTR program performance and will be used in developing the employer's CTR program. The survey methodology used by the affected employer, including but not limited to sample size and response rates, shall conform to the guidelines and methodology approved by the Washington State Department of Transportation pursuant to RCW 70.94.537(2)(b) and the Washington Administrative Code, Chapter 468-63. The Director will provide sample surveys for affected employers to use and will work collaboratively with affected employers to complete and process the surveys.
2. Initial CTR Program Submittal.

    1. Timing of CTR Program Submittal. An affected employer shall submit its initial CTR program to the Director for review no later than ninety (90) days after completing its baseline measurement pursuant to subsection A of this section.
    2. Extension. An affected employer may request an extension of up to ninety (90) days for submitting its initial CTR program. The Director shall grant all or part of the extension request or shall deny the request within ten (10) days of receipt of the written request. If the director fails to respond within ten days, the extension is automatically granted for thirty (30) calendar days. An extension will not excuse affected employers from developing a commute trip reduction program and submitting a description of that program to the Director for review not more than ninety days after the affected employer receives the results of the baseline measurement.
    3. If the Director rejects an affected employer's initial CTR program, the affected employer shall make the changes required by a Director's decision made pursuant to this section and resubmit its initial CTR program within thirty (30) days after receiving the Director's decision.
3. Initial CTR Program Content. Each employer CTR program shall include the following:

    1. Worksite Characteristics. A CTR program shall include a description of worksite characteristics, including the total number of employees and number of affected employees at the worksite, transportation characteristics and surrounding services, and any unique conditions that may affect employee commute choices.
    2. Mandatory CTR Program Elements. An affected employer's CTR program shall specifically identify at least two (2) of the following measures to be implemented by the affected employer:

        1. Provide bicycle parking facilities and/or lockers, changing areas, and showers for employees who walk or bicycle to work.
        2. Provide commuter ride-matching services to facilitate employee ride-sharing for commute trips.
        3. Provide subsidies for transit fares.
        4. Provide employer vans or third-party vans for vanpooling.
        5. Provide subsidy for carpool and vanpool participation.
        6. Permit the use of the employer's vehicles for carpool and/or vanpool commute trips.
        7. Permit alternative work schedules such as a compressed workweek that reduce commute trips by affected employees between six (6:00) a.m. and nine (9:00) a.m. A compressed workweek regularly allows a full-time employee to eliminate at least one (1) workday every two (2) weeks, by working longer hours during the remaining days, resulting in fewer commute trips by the employee.
        8. Permit alternative work schedules such as flex-time that reduce commute trips by affected employees between six (6:00) a.m. and nine (9:00) a.m. Flex-time allows individual employees some flexibility in choosing the time, but not the number, of their working hours.
        9. Provide preferential parking for high-occupancy vehicles.
        10. Provide reduced parking charges for high-occupancy vehicles.
        11. Collaborate with transportation providers to provide additional regular or express service to the work site (e.g., a custom bus service arranged specifically to transport employees to work).
        12. Construct special loading and unloading facilities for transit, carpool and/or vanpool users.
        13. Provide and fund a program of parking incentives such as a cash payment for employees who do not use the parking facilities.
        14. Institute or increase parking charges for SOVs.
        15. Establish a program to permit employees to telecommute either part- or full-time, where telecommuting is an arrangement that permits an employee to work from home, eliminating a commute trip, or to work from a work center closer to home, reducing the distance traveled in a commute trip by at least half.
        16. Provide a shuttle between the employer's worksite and the closest park-and-ride lot, transit center, or principal transit street.
        17. Attend at least four meetings of a local transportation management association, transportation management organization, or employer transportation network group each year.
        18. Implement other measures designed and demonstrated to facilitate the use of non-SOV commute modes or to reduce vehicle miles traveled that are agreed upon between the Director and the affected employer.
    3. CTR Implementation Plan. An affected employer's CTR program shall provide for:

        1. Distribution of the CTR program to affected employees at least twice a year and to each new affected employee when the new affected employee begins employment.
        2. Designation of an employee transportation coordinator to administer the CTR program and to act as a liaison to the Director for one or more worksites of an affected employer. The coordinator's and/or designee's name, location and telephone number must be displayed prominently at each worksite.
        3. Appropriate resources to carry out the CTR program.
        4. Retention of all records related to the affected employer's CTR compliance for at least twenty-four (24) months.
4. Initial CTR Program Review and Approval.

        2. If the Director approves an affected employer's initial CTR program, the Director's decision shall establish a date by which the affected employer is required to submit subsequent regular program reports pursuant to Section 25.02.050. The regular program reporting date shall be no sooner than one-year and ninety (90) days from the date of the Director's decision approving the initial CTR program.
        3. If the Director rejects an employer's initial CTR program, the Director's decision shall explain the reasons for the rejection and set forth changes that are required to obtain approval.
    2. Review Standards. An affected employer's CTR program shall be approved if the program:

        1. satisfies the minimum requirements of this chapter; and
        2. is likely to achieve the commute trip reduction goals applicable to the affected employer under the City's CTR plan.
    3. Initial CTR Program Implementation. An affected employer shall begin implementing its approved CTR program no later than ninety (90) days after the program is approved pursuant to subsection D of this section.
    4. CTR Program Amendment. An affected employer may not alter or amend its approved CTR program without the express written approval of the Director.

1. Submittal of Revised CTR Program. An affected employer shall submit a revised CTR program if, based on a review of the affected employer's program report or most recent biannual survey results pursuant to Section 25.02.050, the Director finds that the employer has not met either its VMT or SOV reduction goals.

    1. Submittal Deadline.

        1. If the Director's decision finds that an affected employer has made a good faith effort, the affected employer shall submit a revised CTR program by a date agreed to in writing between the affected employer and the Director.
        2. If the Director's decision finds that an employer has failed to make a good faith effort, the affected employer shall submit a revised CTR program within thirty (30) days following receipt of the Director's decision.
    2. Collaborative Process for Developing Revisions. The Director will work collaboratively with an affected employer to reach agreement on program revisions prior to the applicable deadline for submitting a revised CTR program under this section. The Director may grant one or more thirty (30) day extensions if the affected employer demonstrates progress in developing revisions to its CTR program.
2. Contents of Revised CTR Program. An affected employer's revised CTR program shall include all of the elements required for CTR programs under Section 25.02.040, in addition to changes or modifications to the CTR program that are reasonably likely to achieve the SOV and VMT reduction goals applicable to the affected employer under the City's CTR plan.
3. Review and Approval of Revised CTR Program.

    1. Director's Decision.

The program reporting date shall be no sooner than one-year and ninety (90) days from the date of the Director's decision approving the revised CTR program.
        3. If the Director rejects an affected employer's revised CTR program, the Director's decision shall explain the reasons for the rejection and set forth additional program revisions that are required to obtain approval. The affected employer shall resubmit a revised CTR program plan addressing the Director's concerns within 30 days from the date of the Director's decision rejecting the revised CTR program.
    2. Review Standards. Revisions proposed by an affected employer to its CTR program will be approved if they are reasonably likely to achieve the commute trip reduction goals applicable to the affected employer under the City's CTR plan, considering the following factors:

        1. The extent to which the affected employer has implemented its existing CTR program and attained its CTR goals.
        2. The extent to which the affected employer has demonstrated a commitment to implementing the proposed revisions to its CTR program and to achieving its VMT and SOV reduction goals.
        3. The diversity of modes and strategies included in the revised CTR program.
        4. The viability of pedestrian, bicycle, transit, ferry, road, and high occupancy vehicle facilities and the accessibility of such facilities to the affected employer's worksite.
        5. The expected benefit to be derived from specific program revisions, as well as the effect of those revisions on the entire program.
        6. The likely effect of proposed program revisions on the cost and convenience of commuting by non-SOV as opposed to SOV modes of transportation.

### 25.02.065 - Transportation management associations.

In addition to describing program elements that are common to its members, CTR documents submitted by a TMA shall describe specific program measures that are unique to individual members' worksites and include performance data for each affected employer's worksite consistent with the requirements for program reports under Section 25.02.050.
3. Affected Employer Responsibility for CTR Compliance. Each affected employer is responsible for meeting the requirements of this chapter regardless of the affected employer's participation in a TMA. Each program revision shall specify the affected employer to which it applies.

### 25.02.070 - Exemptions from CTR Requirements and adjustments to CTR calculations.

1. Exemptions from Requirement to Implement CTR Program.

    1. Worksite Exemptions. An affected employer that has adopted a CTR program pursuant to Section 25.02.040 may, at any time, submit a request to the Director for an exemption from the requirement to implement its CTR program or from specific elements contained therein, for one or more of its worksites. The affected employer's request must cite the specific CTR program requirements from which it is seeking an exemption and demonstrate that:

        1. due to the characteristics of the affected employer's business, workforce, or location, complying with the requirements of this chapter would cause undue hardship, such as bankruptcy; or
        2. the affected employer is unable for economic reasons to implement any measures that could reduce the proportion of SOV trips and VMT per employee.
    2. Employee Exemptions.

        1. Request for Exemption.

            1. An affected employer may request that the Director exempt the following types of employees from a worksite's CTR program:

                1. Specific employees or groups of employees who are required to drive alone to work as a condition of employment; and
                2. employees who work variable shifts throughout the year and who do not rotate as a group to identical shifts.
            2. Affected employers requesting employee exemptions must do so at least thirty (30) days prior to conducting the surveys required by Section 25.02.050 and shall provide credible documentation indicating the number of employees who qualify for an employee exemption under this subsection.
    3. Duration of Exemption. The Director shall review annually all affected employers receiving any exemption and shall determine if the exemption will remain in effect during the following program year. In making this determination, the Director may require the affected employer to provide additional information related to the economic hardship or other factors on which the exemption was based.
2. Adjustments to the Calculation of Affected Employees.

    1. Request for Adjustment.

        1. An affected employer may request that the Director, in determining whether the affected employer has met its goals and targets for purposes of the biannual survey, exclude the following types of employees in calculating the total number of affected employees:

            1. employees who are required to use the vehicles they drive to work during the workday for work purposes; and
            2. full-time employees who work variable shifts that sometimes begin between six (6:00) a.m. to nine (9:00) a.m. and sometimes begin outside of that time period, but not those employees who rotate shifts together as part of a group.
    2. Deadline to Request Adjustments. Affected employers requesting adjustments to the calculation of affected employees must do so at least thirty (30) days prior to conducting the survey required by Section 25.02.050. The affected employer shall provide credible documentation indicating how many employees qualify to be excluded from the calculation of affected employees pursuant to this subsection and must demonstrate that no reasonable alternative commute trip reduction program can be developed for these employees.
    3. Effect of Adjustment. Adjustments to the calculation of affected employees approved pursuant to this subsection are solely for the purpose of determining affected employer progress toward achieving the CTR goals and do not change whether the affected employer is subject to this chapter.
3. Director's Decision on Requests for Exemptions and Adjustments.

    1. Requirements for Requests. All requests made by affected employers pursuant to this section shall be addressed to the Director in writing and shall include the information required for the particular type of exemption or adjustment being sought.
    2. Standards for Granting Exemptions and Adjustments. The Director shall grant requests for exemptions and adjustments that are supported by credible documentation and meet the applicable criteria in this section. Within thirty (30) days of receiving a request from an affected employer pursuant to this section, the Director shall issue a decision granting or denying the request and mail a copy of the decision to the affected employer.

### 25.02.080 - Appeal of Director's Decision

    2. Decisions rejecting a CTR program report pursuant to Section 25.02.050 for failure to include the required performance data.
    3. Decisions approving a CTR program report pursuant to Section 25.02.050, but finding that the affected employer has not met its goals and targets and is therefore required to submit a revised CTR program pursuant to Section 25.02.050 and 25.02.055.
    4. Decisions rejecting a revised CTR program pursuant to Section 25.02.055.
    5. Decisions denying a request for an exemption or adjustment under Section 25.02.070.
2. Effect of Appeal or Failure to Appeal. If a Director's decision is timely appealed to the Hearing Examiner, any deadline imposed by that decision for submitting an initial or revised CTR program or report is tolled pending the outcome of the appeal. If the Hearing Examiner affirms the Director's decision, the Hearing Examiner shall set a new deadline for submitting an initial or revised CTR program or report. If the affected employer does not appeal a Director's decision to the Hearing Examiner, the Director's decision is final for purposes of enforcement action under Section 25.02.090.
3. Hearing Examiner Appeal Procedures. Except as otherwise provided by this Section 25.02.080, appeals of Director's decisions pursuant to this Chapter 25.02 are governed by the Hearing Examiner's rules for contested cases adopted pursuant to Chapter 3.02.

    1. Standing. Only an affected employer subject to a decision of the Director may appeal that decision to the Hearing Examiner.
    2. Filing Requirements.

        1. Appeals shall be filed with the Hearing Examiner no later than 5 p.m. on the fourteenth calendar day following the date of the Director's decision. When the last day of the appeal period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period extends until 5 p.m. on the next business day. The appeal shall be accompanied by payment of the applicable filing fee set forth in Section 3.02.125.
        2. In form and content, the appeal shall conform to the rules of the Hearing Examiner adopted pursuant to Chapter 3.02.
    3. Hearing and Notice of Hearing. The Hearing Examiner shall schedule a hearing and provide notice of the hearing at least 20 days prior to the scheduled hearing date.
4. Hearing— Scope of Review. The hearing shall be conducted de novo and in accordance with the Hearing Examiner's rules of procedure. The Hearing Examiner shall consider only those issues raised in the notice of appeal and relating to the requirements of this Chapter 25.02.
5. Hearing Examiner's Decision. Within 30 days after the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall issue a written decision that shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of the decision. The Hearing Examiner may affirm, reverse, remand, or modify the Director's decision. The Director and the affected employer that appealed the Director's decision shall be bound by the terms and conditions of the Hearing Examiner's decision unless the decision is reversed or remanded on judicial review.
6. Notice of Hearing Examiner Decision. On the day the Hearing Examiner issues a decision, the Hearing Examiner shall provide the decision to the Director and to the employer that appealed.

### 25.02.090 - Violation—Penalties.

1. Civil Penalties.

    1. Amount of Penalty. A person who commits any of the violations enumerated in this section is subject to a cumulative civil penalty in an amount not to exceed two hundred and fifty ($250) dollars for each day that the violation continues, beginning on the date for compliance established by a notice of violation issued pursuant to this section.
    2. Collection of Penalty.

        1. If the violation relates to a requirement imposed by a decision of the Director, and that decision has been appealed to the Hearing Examiner pursuant to Section 25.02.080, no action for civil penalties shall be commenced and no civil penalties may be collected or imposed until the appeal has been resolved.
        2. The penalty imposed by this section shall be collected by civil action brought in the name of the City. The Director shall notify the City Attorney in writing of the name of any employer subject to a penalty, and the City Attorney shall, with the assistance of the Director, take appropriate action to collect the penalty.
    3. Burden of Proof. In any civil action for a penalty, the City shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation enumerated in a notice of violation exists or existed. An unappealed decision of the Director or an unappealed decision of the Hearing Examiner finding that a CTR program or report fails to comply with this chapter is conclusive evidence of a violation.
2. Violations.

    1. Violations Subject to Civil Penalties.

        1. Failure to comply with the requirements of Section 25.02.040 for initial CTR programs; the requirements of Section 25.02.050 for CTR program reports, or the requirements of Section 25.02.055 for revised CTR programs.
        2. Failure to make a good faith effort as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter.
    2. Violations Not Subject to Penalties.

        1. Violations resulting from an inability to reach agreement with a certified collective bargaining agent under applicable laws where the issue was raised by an employer and pursued in good faith. A unionized employer shall be presumed to act in good faith if it:

            1. Proposes to a recognized union any provision of the employer's CTR program that is subject to bargaining as defined by the National Labor Relations Act; and
            2. Advises the union that compliance with the CTR program approved by the City is required by the Washington Clean Air Act (RCW 70.94.521-.555), and advises the union that the proposal being made is necessary for compliance with the CTR program.
        2. Failure to achieve SOV or VMT reduction goals so long as an affected employer is working in good faith to meet such goals.
3. Notice of Violation.

    1. Issuance and Service. If the Director determines that an affected employer has failed to comply with the requirements of this chapter, the Director may issue a notice of violation and send it by first class mail addressed to the affected employer's chief executive officer or highest-ranking official at the worksite.
    2. Contents. The notice of violation shall contain:

        1. The name and address of the affected employer;
        2. A statement that the Director has found the affected employer to have committed a violation subject to civil penalty pursuant to this chapter, with a description of the specific requirements found to have been violated.
        3. A statement of the corrective action required to cure the violation and the date by which such action must be taken in order to avoid the imposition of civil penalties by the Director.
    3. Legal Effect. The Director may not seek civil penalties pursuant to this section unless a notice of violation has been issued, but the notice of violation is not evidence of the violation in any civil action to collect such penalties.
4. Criminal Penalties. An employer who submits a report pursuant to this chapter is subject to state and local laws making it a crime to submit false information.

### 25.02.100 - Administration and implementation.

1. Responsible Agency. The Department is authorized to administer and implement this chapter.
2. The Director of the Department is authorized to:

    1. Promulgate administrative rules to implement this chapter and to implement the guidelines developed by the Washington CTR Board pursuant to RCW 70.94.537.
    2. Develop and recommend to the City Council proposed amendments to the City's CTR plan.
    3. Coordinate with other jurisdictions to improve consistency in the development and implementation of CTR plans.
    4. Provide technical assistance to affected employers within the City of Seattle to assist them in complying with the requirements of this chapter and to further their SOV and VMT reduction goals.
    5. Implement a CTR plan for City of Seattle employees.
    6. Provide information on the City of Seattle CTR Plan, in addition to reports and other required information, to the state CTR board.
    7. Carry out all functions authorized by this chapter, including but not limited to reviewing affected employer CTR programs and reports and enforcing the requirements of this chapter.

### 25.02.110 - Savings Clause.

The amendment or repeal of any section of Chapter 25.02 SMC shall not affect any right or duty accrued or any proceeding commenced under the provisions of such amended or repealed sections which were in existence on the effective date of the amended or repealed sections of chapter 25.02 SMC.



## Chapter 25.05 - ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Sections:

### Subchapter I - Purpose/Authority
#### 25.05.010 - Authority.

(See WAC 197-11-010).

This chapter is adopted as required by Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 197-11 to implement the State Environmental Policy Act and the State Environmental Policy Act Rules (WAC 197-11). This chapter may be cited as the "SEPA Rules," and "these rules" as used herein refers to this chapter. As required in RCW 43.21C.095 the SEPA Rules shall be given substantial deference in the interpretation of SEPA.


#### 25.05.020 - Purpose.

(See WAC 197-11-020).


1. The purpose of these rules is to adopt the uniform requirements of WAC 197-11 for compliance with SEPA and to establish local procedures and policies where permitted. Many sections of WAC 197-11 are adopted verbatim or nearly so, and in all cases the last three (3) digits of each section number of this chapter corresponds to the comparable section of WAC 197-11.
2. These rules replace the previous guidelines in Chapter 197-10 WAC and Chapter 25.04 of the Seattle Municipal Code.
3. The provisions of these rules, Chapter 197-11 WAC and the State Environmental Policy Act must be read together as a whole in order to comply with the spirit and letter of the law. The City of Seattle adopts by reference the purposes and policies of SEPA as set forth in RCW 43.21C.010 and 43.21C.020.

#### 25.05.030 - Policy.

1. The policies and goals set forth in SEPA are supplementary to existing agency authority.
2. Agencies shall to the fullest extent possible:

    1. Interpret and administer the policies, regulations and laws of the state of Washington in accordance with the policies set forth in SEPA and these rules;
    2. Find ways to make the SEPA process more useful to decisionmakers and the public; promote certainty regarding the requirements of the act; reduce paperwork and the accumulation of extraneous background data; and emphasize important environmental impacts and alternatives;
    3. Prepare environmental documents that are concise, clear, and to the point, and are supported by evidence that the necessary environmental analyses have been made;
    4. Initiate the SEPA process early in conjunction with other agency operations to avoid delay and duplication;
    5. Integrate the requirements of SEPA with existing agency planning and licensing procedures and practices, so that such procedures run concurrently rather than consecutively;
    6. Encourage public involvement in decisions that significantly affect environmental quality;
    7. Identify, evaluate, and require or implement, where required by the act and these rules, reasonable alternatives that would mitigate adverse effects of proposed actions on the environment.

#### 25.05.035 - Rules and departmental procedures.

The Mayor is authorized to promulgate rules pursuant to the Administrative Code (Chapter 3.02), consistent with this chapter, to facilitate the application of this chapter to City departments and operations. All departments subject to the provisions of this chapter are authorized and directed to develop and promulgate such supplementary procedures as they deem appropriate for implementing the provisions of this chapter within each department. All such supplemental procedures shall be consistent with this chapter, WAC 197-11 and the State Environmental Policy Act, and shall be kept on file at the SEPA Public Information Center.



### Subchapter II - General Requirements
#### 25.05.040 - Definitions.

The terms used in these rules are explained in Subchapter VIII, Definitions, Sections 25.05.700 to 25.05.799. This terminology is uniform throughout the state as applied to SEPA, Chapter 43.21C RCW. In addition to the definitions set forth in WAC 197-11-700 through 197-11-799, this chapter includes definitions for Seattle, as indicated in Section 25.05.700 et seq.


#### 25.05.050 - Lead agency.

1. A lead agency shall be designated when an agency is developing or is presented with a proposal, following the rules beginning at Section 25.05.922.
2. The lead agency shall be the agency with main responsibility for complying with SEPA's procedural requirements and shall be the only agency responsible for:

    1. The threshold determination; and
    2. Preparation and content of environmental impact statements.
3. In those instances in which the City is not the lead agency under the criteria of Sections 25.05.922 through 25.05.948, all departments shall use unchanged either a DNS subject to the limits of Section 25.05.390 or a final EIS subject to the limits of Subchapter VI of this chapter in connection with the decisions of the City on the proposal.

#### 25.05.055 - Timing of the SEPA process.

1. Integrating SEPA and Agency Activities. The SEPA process shall be integrated with agency activities at the earliest possible time to ensure that planning and decisions reflect environmental values, to avoid delays later in the process, and to seek to resolve potential problems.
2. Timing of Review of Proposals. The lead agency shall prepare its threshold determination and environmental impact statement (EIS), if required, at the earliest possible point in the planning and decisionmaking process, when the principal features of a proposal and its environmental impacts can be reasonably identified.

    1. A proposal exists when an agency is presented with an application or has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one (1) or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal and the environmental effects can be meaningfully evaluated.

        1. The fact that proposals may require future agency approvals or environmental review shall not preclude current consideration, as long as proposed future activities are specific enough to allow some evaluation of their probable environmental impacts.
        2. Preliminary steps or decisions are sometimes needed before an action is sufficiently definite to allow meaningful environmental analysis.
    2. A major purpose of the environmental review process is to provide environmental information to governmental decisionmakers for consideration prior to making their decision on any action. The actual decision to proceed with any actions may involve a series of individual approvals or decisions. Agencies may also organize environmental review in phases, as specified in Section 25.05.060 E.
    3. Appropriate consideration of environmental information shall be completed before an agency commits to a particular course of action (Section 25.05.070).
    4. The City of Seattle, planning under the State Growth Management ACT (GMA), is subject to additional timing requirements (see Section 25.05.310).
3. Applications and Rulemaking. The timing of environmental review for applications and for rulemaking shall be as follows:

    1. At the latest, the lead agency shall begin environmental review, if required, when an application is complete. The lead agency may initiate review earlier and may have informal conferences with applicants. A final threshold determination or FEIS shall normally precede or accompany the final staff recommendations, if any, in a quasi-judicial proceeding on an application. Environmental documents shall be submitted to the City Planning Commission and similar advisory bodies when their advice is sought.
    2. For rulemaking, the DNS or DEIS, if required, shall normally accompany the proposed rule. An FEIS, if any, shall be issued at least seven (7) days before adoption of a final rule (Section 25.05.460 D).
4. Applicant Review at Conceptual Stage. In general, procedures contemplate environmental review and preparation of EIS's on private proposals at the conceptual stage rather than the final detailed design stage.

    1. If an agency's only action is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and specifications, agencies shall provide applicants with the opportunity for environmental review under SEPA prior to requiring applicants to submit such detailed project plans and specifications.
    2. Agencies may specify the amount of detail needed from applicants for such early environmental review, consistent with Sections 25.05.100 and 25.05.335, in their SEPA or permit procedures. For master use permits, see Section 23.76.010.
    3. This subsection does not preclude agencies or applicants from preliminary discussions or exploration of ideas and options prior to commencing formal environmental review.
5. Decision to Proceed. An overall decision to proceed with a course of action may involve a series of actions or decisions by one or more agencies. If several agencies have jurisdiction over a proposal they should coordinate their SEPA processes wherever possible. The agencies shall comply with lead agency determination requirements in Sections 25.05.050 and 25.05.922.
6. Circulation and Review of Environmental Documents. To meet the requirement to ensure that environmental values and amenities are given appropriate consideration along with economic and technical considerations, environmental documents and analyses shall be circulated and reviewed with other planning documents to the fullest extent possible.
7. Extension of Lead Agency Time Limits. For their own public proposals, lead agencies may extend the time limits prescribed in these rules.

#### 25.05.060 - Content of environmental review.

1. Environmental review consists of the range of proposed activities, alternatives, and impacts to be analyzed in an environmental document, in accordance with SEPA's goals and policies. This section specifies the content of environmental review common to all environmental documents required under SEPA.
2. The content of environmental review:

    1. Depends on each particular proposal, on an agency's existing planning and decisionmaking processes, and on the time when alternatives and impacts can be most meaningfully evaluated;
    2. For the purpose of deciding whether an EIS is required, is specified in the environmental checklist, in Sections 25.05.330 and 25.05.444;
    3. For an environmental impact statement, is considered its "scope" (Section 25.05.792 and Subchapter IV of these rules);
    4. For any supplemental environmental review, is specified in Subchapter VI.
3. Proposals.

    1. Agencies shall make certain that the proposal that is the subject of environmental review is properly defined.

        1. Proposals include public projects or proposals by agencies, proposals by applicants, if any, and proposed actions and regulatory decisions of agencies in response to proposals by applicants.
        2. A proposal by a lead agency or applicant may be put forward as an objective, as several alternative means of accomplishing a goal, or as a particular or preferred course of action.
        3. Proposals should be described in ways that encourage considering and comparing alternatives. Agencies are encouraged to describe public or nonproject proposals in terms of objectives rather than preferred solutions. A proposal could be described, for example, as "reducing flood damage and achieving better flood control by one or a combination of the following means: Building a new dam; maintenance dredging; use of shoreline and land use controls; purchase of floodprone areas; or relocation assistance."
    2. Proposals or parts of proposals that are related to each other closely enough to be, in effect, a single course of action shall be evaluated in the same environmental document. (Phased review is allowed under subsection E.) Proposals or parts of proposals are closely related, and they shall be discussed in the same environmental document, if they:

        1. Cannot or will not proceed unless the other proposals (or parts of proposals) are implemented simultaneously with them; or
        2. Are interdependent parts of a larger proposal and depend on the larger proposal as their justification or for their implementation.
    3. Agencies may at their options analyze "similar actions" in a single environmental document.

        1. Proposals are similar if, when viewed with other reasonably foreseeable actions, they have common aspects that provide a basis for evaluating their environmental consequences together, such as common timing, types of impacts, alternatives, or geography. This section does not require agencies or applicants to analyze similar actions in a single environmental document or require applicants to prepare environmental documents on proposals other than their own.
        2. When preparing environmental documents on similar actions, agencies may find it useful to define the proposals in one of the following ways: (i) Geographically, which may include actions occurring in the same general location, such as a body of water, region, or metropolitan area; or (ii) generically, which may include actions which have relevant similarities, such as common timing, impacts, alternatives, methods of implementation, environmental media, or subject matter.
4. Impacts.

    1. SEPA's procedural provisions require the consideration of "environmental" impacts (see definition of "environment" in Section 25.05.740 and of "impacts" in Section 25.05.752), with attention to impacts that are likely, not merely speculative. (See definition of "probable" in Section 25.05.782 and Section 25.05.080 on incomplete or unavailable information.)
    2. In assessing the significance of an impact, a lead agency shall not limit its consideration of a proposal's impacts only to those aspects within its jurisdiction, including local or state boundaries (see Section 25.05.330 C also).
    3. Agencies shall carefully consider the range of probable impacts, including short-term and long-term effects. Impacts shall include those that are likely to arise or exist over the lifetime of a proposal or, depending on the particular proposal, longer.
    4. A proposal's effects include direct and indirect impacts caused by a proposal. Impacts include those effects resulting from growth caused by a proposal, as well as the likelihood that the present proposal will serve as a precedent for future actions. For example, adoption of a zoning ordinance will encourage or tend to cause particular types of projects or extension of sewer lines would tend to encourage development in previously unsewered areas.
    5. The range of impacts to be analyzed in an EIS (direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts, Section 25.05.792) may be wider than the impacts for which mitigation measures are required of applicants (Section 25.05.660). This will depend upon the specific impacts, the extent to which the adverse impacts are attributable to the applicant's proposal, and the capability of applicants or agencies to control the impacts in each situation.
5. Phased Review.

    1. Lead agencies shall determine the appropriate scope and level of detail of environmental review to coincide with meaningful points in their planning and decisionmaking processes. (See Section 25.05.055 on timing of environmental review.)
    2. Environmental review may be phased. If used, phased review assists agencies and the public to focus on issues that are ready for decision and exclude from consideration issues already decided or not yet ready. Broader environmental documents may be followed by narrower documents, for example, that incorporate prior general discussion by reference and concentrate solely on the issues to that phase of proposal.
    3. Phased review is appropriate when:

        1. The sequence is from a nonproject document to a document of narrower scope such as a site specific analysis (see, for example, Section 25.05.443); or
        2. The sequence is from an environmental document on a specific proposal at an early stage (such as need and site selection) to a subsequent environmental document at a later stage (such as sensitive design impacts).
    4. Phased review is not appropriate when:

        1. The sequence is from a narrow project document to a broad policy document;
        2. It would merely divide a larger system into exempted fragments or avoid discussion of cumulative impacts; or
        3. It would segment and avoid present consideration of proposals and their impacts that are required to be evaluated in a single environmental document under Section 25.05.060 C2 or Section 25.05.305 A; however, the level of detail and type of environmental review may vary with the nature and timing of proposals and their component parts.
    5. When a lead agency knows it is using phased review, it shall so state in its environmental document.
    6. Agencies shall use the environmental checklist, scoping process, nonproject EIS's, incorporation by reference, adoption, and supplemental EIS's, and addenda, as appropriate, to avoid duplication and excess paperwork.
    7. Where proposals are related to a large existing or planned network, such as highways, streets, pipelines, or utility lines or systems, the lead agency may analyze in detail the overall network as the present proposal or may select some of the future elements for present detailed consideration. Any phased review shall be logical in relation to the design of the overall system or network, and shall be consistent with this section and Section 25.05.070.

#### 25.05.070 - Limitations on actions during SEPA process.

1. Until the responsible official issues a final determination of nonsignificance or final environmental impact statement, no action concerning the proposal shall be taken by a governmental agency that would:

    1. Have an adverse environmental impact; or
    2. Limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.
2. In addition, certain DNS's require a 14 day period prior to agency action (subsection 25.05.340.B), and FEIS's require a seven day period prior to agency action (subsection 25.05.460.E).
3. In preparing environmental documents, there may be a need to conduct studies that may cause nonsignificant environmental impacts. If such activity is not exempt under Section 25.05.800.R (information collection and research), the activity may nonetheless proceed if a checklist is prepared and appropriate mitigation measures taken.
4. This section does not preclude developing plans or designs, issuing requests for proposals (RFPs), securing options, or performing other work necessary to develop an application for a proposal, as long as such activities are consistent with subsection 25.05.070.A.
5. No final authorization of any permit shall be granted until expiration of the time period for filing an appeal in accordance with Section 25.05.680, or if an appeal is filed, until the fifth day following termination of the appeal. If, on or before the fifth day following termination of an appeal, a party of record files with the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, a written notice of intent to seek judicial review of the City's action, no direct modification of the physical environment shall begin or be authorized until the thirty-first day following termination of the appeal or until a court has disposed of any requests for preliminary injunctive relief, whichever occurs first. Where substantial injury to a party would result from a delay of construction, demolition, grading, or other direct modification of the physical environment, the official or body hearing the appeal shall grant an expedited hearing, in which case shorter notice less than 20 days prior to the hearing may be given as permitted by subsection 3.02.090.A.

#### 25.05.080 - Incomplete or unavailable information.

Then the agency shall weigh the need for the action with the severity of possible adverse impacts which would occur if the agency were to decide to proceed in the face of uncertainty. If the agency proceeds, it shall generally indicate in the appropriate environmental documents its worst case analysis and the likelihood of occurrence, to the extent this information can reasonably be developed.


1. If information on significant adverse impacts essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives is not known, and the costs of obtaining it are not exorbitant, agencies shall obtain and include the information in their environmental documents.
2. When there are gaps in relevant information or scientific uncertainty concerning significant impacts, agencies shall make clear that such information is lacking or that substantial uncertainty exists.
3. Agencies may proceed in the absence of vital information as follows:

    1. If information relevant to adverse impacts is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives, but it is not known, and the costs of obtaining it are exorbitant; or
    2. If information relevant to adverse impacts is important to the decision and the means to obtain it are speculative or not known;
4. Agencies may rely upon applicants to provide information as allowed in Section 25.05.100.

#### 25.05.090 - Supporting documents.

If an agency prepares background or supporting analyses, studies, or technical reports, such material shall be considered part of the agency's record of compliance with SEPA, as long as the preparation and circulation of such material complies with the requirements in these rules for incorporation by reference and the use of supporting documents.


#### 25.05.100 - Information required of applicants.

Further information may be required if the responsible official determines that the information initially supplied is not reasonably adequate to fulfill the purposes for which it is required. An applicant may, at any time, voluntarily submit information beyond that required under these rules. An agency is allowed to require information from an applicant in the following areas:


1. Environmental Checklist. An applicant may be required to complete the environmental checklist in Section 25.05.960 in connection with filing an application (see Section 25.05.315). Additional information may be required at an applicant's expense, but not until after initial agency review of the checklist (Sections 25.05.315 and 25.05.335).
2. Threshold Determination. Any additional information required by an agency after its initial review of the checklist shall be limited to those elements on the checklist for which the lead agency has determined that information accessible to the agency is not reasonably sufficient to evaluate the environmental impacts of the proposal. The lead agency may require field investigation or research by the applicant reasonably related to determining a proposal's environmental impacts (Section 25.05.335). An applicant may clarify or revise the checklist at any time prior to a threshold determination. Revision of a checklist after a threshold determination is issued shall be made under Section 25.05.340 or 25.05.360.
3. Environmental Impact Statements. The responsible official may require an applicant to provide relevant information that is not in the possession of the lead agency. Although an agency may include additional analysis not required under SEPA in an EIS (Sections 25.05.440 G, 25.05.448 D and 25.05.640), the agency shall not require the applicant to furnish such information, under these rules. An applicant shall not be required to provide information requested of a consulted agency until the agency has responded or the time allowed for the consulted agency's response has elapsed, whichever is earlier. Preparation of an EIS by the applicant is in Section 25.05.420.

#### 25.05.164 - Planned actions—Definitions and criteria

Under the authority of RCW 43.21C.440, the City Council may adopt ordinances designating planned actions. A planned action means one or more types of project action that:


1. Are designated planned actions by an ordinance adopted by The City of Seattle;
2. Have had the significant environmental impacts adequately addressed in an EIS prepared in conjunction with:

    1. A subarea or neighborhood plan adopted under chapter 36.70A RCW, or
    2. A master planned development or phased project.
3. Are subsequent or implementing projects for the proposals listed in subsection 25.05.164.B;
4. Are located within an urban growth area, as defined in RCW 36.70A.030;
5. Are not essential public facilities, as defined in RCW 36.70A.200; and
6. Are consistent with the Seattle Comprehensive Plan adopted under chapter 36.70A RCW.

#### 25.05.168 - Ordinances designating planned actions—Procedures for adoption.

1. City Council shall adopt planned actions by ordinance.
2. The ordinance shall include the following information:

    1. A description of the type(s) of project action being designated as a planned action;
    2. A description of how the planned action meets the criteria in Section 25.05.164 (including specific reference to the ElS that addresses any significant environmental impacts of the planned action);
    3. A finding that the environmental impacts of the planned action have been identified and adequately addressed in the EIS, subject to project review under Section 25.05.172; and
    4. Identification of any specific mitigation measures other than applicable development regulations that must be applied to a project for it to qualify as the planned action.
3. If the City has not limited the planned action to a specific time period identified in the EIS, it may do so in the ordinance designating the planned action.
4. Each planned action ordinance may include provisions to provide for a periodic review and update procedure for the planned action to monitor implementation and consider changes as warranted.

#### 25.05.172 - Planned actions—Project review.

1. Planned action project review shall include:

    1. Verification that the project meets the description in, and will implement any applicable conditions or mitigation measures identified in, the designating ordinance; and
    2. Verification that the probable significant adverse environmental impacts of the project have been adequately addressed in the EIS prepared under Section 25.05.164 B through review of an environmental checklist or other project review form as specified in Section 25.05.315, filed with the project application.
2. 1. If the project meets the requirements of subsection A of this section, the project shall qualify as the planned action designated by the City, and a project threshold determination or EIS is not required. Nothing in this section limits the City as lead agency from using this chapter or other applicable laws to place conditions on the project in order to mitigate nonsignificant impacts through the normal local project review and permitting process.

    1. If the project does not meet the requirements of subsection A of this section, the project is not a planned action and a threshold determination is required. In conducting the additional environmental review under this chapter, the lead agency may use information in existing environmental documents, including the EIS used to designate the planned action (refer to Section 25.05.330 B1 and Sections 25.05.600 through 25.05.635). If an EIS or SEIS is prepared on the proposed project, its scope is limited to those probable significant adverse environmental impacts that were not adequately addressed in the EIS used to designate the planned action.
3. Public notice for projects that qualify as planned actions shall be based on the notice requirements of the underlying permit. If notice is otherwise required for the underlying permit, the notice shall state that the project has qualified as a planned action.

### Subchapter III - Categorical Exemptions and Threshold Determination
#### 25.05.300 - Purpose of this subchapter.

This subchapter provides rules for:


1. Administering categorical exemptions for proposals that would not have probable significant adverse impacts;
2. Deciding whether a proposal has a probable significant adverse impact and thus requires an EIS (the threshold determination);
3. Providing a way to review and mitigate nonexempt proposals through the threshold determination;
4. Integrating the environmental analysis required by SEPA into early planning to ensure appropriate consideration of SEPA's policies and to eliminate duplication and delay; and
5. Integrating the environmental analysis required by SEPA into the project review process.

#### 25.05.305 - Categorical exemptions.

1. If a proposal fits within any of the provisions in Subchapter IX of these rules, the proposal shall be categorically exempt from threshold determination requirements (Section 25.05.720) except as follows:

For such proposals, the agency or applicant may proceed with the exempt aspects of the proposals, prior to conducting environmental review, if the requirements of Section 25.05.070 are met.


    1. The proposal is not exempt under Section 25.05.908, environmentally critical areas;
    2. The proposal is a segment of a proposal that includes:

        1. A series of actions, physically or functionally related to each other, some of which are categorically exempt and some of which are not, or
        2. A series of exempt actions that are physically or functionally related to each other, and that together may have a probable significant adverse environmental impact in the judgment of an agency with jurisdiction. If so, that agency shall be the lead agency, unless the agencies with jurisdiction agree that another agency should be the lead agency. Agencies may petition the Department of Ecology to resolve disputes (Section 25.05.946), or may petition the Mayor to resolve disputes between City agencies (Section 25.05.910).
2. An agency is not required to document that a proposal is categorically exempt. Agencies may note on an application that a proposal is categorically exempt or place such a determination in agency files.
3. If requested by a private applicant, the responsible official shall make a preliminary determination as to the scope of a proposal and whether the proposal is categorically exempt within seven (7) days following submission of such request.

#### 25.05.310 - Threshold determination required.

1. A threshold determination is required for any proposal which meets the definition of action and is not categorically exempt, subject to the limitations in Section 25.05.600 C concerning proposals for which a threshold determination has already been issued. A threshold determination is not required for a planned action (refer to Sections 25.05.164 through 25.05.172).
2. The responsible official of the lead agency shall make the threshold determination, which shall be made as close as possible to the time an agency has developed or is presented with a proposal (Section 25.05.784). If the lead agency is the City, the timing requirements in subsection C of this section must be met.
3. When the City is lead agency for a project, the following timing requirements apply:

    1. If a DS is made concurrent with the notice of application, the DS and scoping notice shall be combined with the notice of application (RCW 36.70B.110). Nothing in this subsection prevents the DS/scoping notice from being issued before the notice of application. If sufficient information is not available to make a threshold determination when the notice of application is issued, the DS may be issued later in the review process.
    2. Nothing in this section prevents a lead agency, when it is a project proponent or is funding a project, from conducting its review under SEPA or from allowing appeals of procedural determinations prior to submitting a project permit application.
    3. If an open record predecision hearing is required, the threshold determination shall be issued at least fifteen (15) days before the open record predecision hearing (RCW 36.70B.110 (6)(b)).
    4. The early review DNS process in Section 25.05.355 may be used to indicate on the notice of application that the lead agency is likely to issue a DNS. If this process is used, a separate comment period on the DNS shall not be required (refer to Section 25.05.355 D).
4. All threshold determinations shall be documented in:

    1. A determination of nonsignificance (DNS) (Section 25.05.340); or
    2. A determination of significance (DS) (Section 25.05.360).

#### 25.05.315 - Environmental checklist.

1. Agencies shall use the environmental checklist substantially in the form found in Section 25.05.960 to assist in making threshold determinations for proposals, except for public proposals on which the lead agency has decided to prepare its own EIS, proposals on which the lead agency and applicant agree an EIS will be prepared; or projects which are proposed as planned actions (see subsection B of this section).
2. For projects submitted as planned actions under Section 25.05.164, the City shall use the existing environmental checklist or modify the environmental checklist form to fulfill the purposes outlined in Section 25.05.172 A, notwithstanding the requirements of WAC 197-11-906 (4).
3. Agencies may use an environmental checklist whenever it would assist in their planning and decision making, but shall only require an applicant to prepare a checklist under SEPA if a checklist is required by subsection A of this section.
4. The lead agency shall prepare the checklist or require an applicant to prepare the checklist.
5. The items in the environmental checklist are not weighted. The mention of one (1) or many adverse environmental impacts does not necessarily mean that the impacts are significant. Conversely, a probable significant adverse impact on the environment may result in the need for an EIS.

#### 25.05.330 - Threshold determination process.

An EIS is required for proposals for legislation and other major actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment. The lead agency decides whether an EIS is required in the threshold determination process, as described below.


1. In making a threshold determination, the responsible official shall:

    1. Review the environmental checklist, if used:

        1. Independently evaluating the responses of any applicant and indicating the result of its evaluation in the DS, in the DNS, or on the checklist, and
        2. Conducting its initial review of the environmental checklist and any supporting documents without requiring additional information from the applicant;
    2. Determine if the proposal is likely to have a probable significant adverse environmental impact, based on the proposed action, the information in the checklist (Section 25.05.960), and any additional information furnished under Section 25.05.335 (Additional information) and Section 25.05.350 (Mitigated DNS); and
    3. Consider mitigation measures which an agency or the applicant will implement as part of the proposal, including any mitigation measures required by the City's development regulations or other existing environmental rules or laws.
2. In making a threshold determination, the responsible official should determine whether:

    1. All or part of the proposal, alternatives, or impacts have been analyzed in a previously prepared environmental document, which can be adopted or incorporated by reference (see Subchapter VI);
    2. Environmental analysis would be more useful or appropriate in the future in which case, the agency shall commit to timely, subsequent environmental review, consistent with Sections 25.05.055 through 25.05.070 and Subchapter VI.
3. In determining an impact's significance (Section 25.05.794), the responsible official shall take into account that:

    1. The same proposal may have a significant adverse impact in one location but not in another location;
    2. The absolute quantitative effects of a proposal are also important, and may result in a significant adverse impact regardless of the nature of the existing environment;
    3. Several marginal impacts when considered together may result in a significant adverse impact;
    4. For some proposals, it may be impossible to forecast the environmental impacts with precision, often because some variables cannot be predicted or values cannot be quantified;
    5. A proposal may to a significant degree:

        1. Adversely affect environmentally critical or special areas, such as loss or destruction of historic, scientific, and cultural resources, parks, prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or wilderness,
        2. Adversely affect endangered or threatened species or their habitat,
        3. Conflict with local, state, or federal laws or requirements for the protection of the environment, and
        4. Establish a precedent for future actions with significant effects, involves unique and unknown risks to the environment, or may affect public health or safety.
4. If after following Section 25.05.080 (incomplete or unavailable information), and Section 25.05.335 (additional information), the lead agency reasonably believes that a proposal may have a significant adverse impact, an EIS is required.
5. A threshold determination shall not balance whether the beneficial aspects of a proposal outweigh its adverse impacts, but rather, shall consider whether a proposal has any probable significant adverse environmental impacts under the rules stated in this section. For example, proposals designed to improve the environment, such as sewage treatment plants or pollution control requirements, may also have significant adverse environmental impacts.

#### 25.05.335 - Additional information.

The lead agency shall make its threshold determination based upon information reasonably sufficient to evaluate the environmental impact of a proposal (Section 25.05.055 B and Section 25.05.060 C). The lead agency may take one (1) or more of the following actions if, after reviewing the checklist, the agency concludes that there is insufficient information to make its threshold determination:


1. Require an applicant to submit more information on subjects in the checklist;
2. Make its own further study, including physical investigation on a proposed site or communicating with interested parties;
3. Consult with other agencies, requesting information on the proposal's potential impacts which lie within the other agencies' jurisdiction or expertise (agencies shall respond in accordance with Section 25.05.550); or
4. Decide that all or part of the action or its impacts are not sufficiently definite to allow environmental analysis and commit to timely, subsequent environmental analysis, consistent with Sections 25.05.055 through 25.05.070.

#### 25.05.340 - Determination of nonsignificance (DNS).

1. If the responsible official determines there will be no probable significant adverse environmental impacts from a proposal, the lead agency shall prepare and issue a determination of nonsignificance (DNS) substantially in the form provided in WAC 197-11-970. If an agency adopts another environmental document in support of a threshold determination (Subchapter VI), the notice of adoption (WAC 197-11-965) and the DNS shall be combined or attached to each other.
2. When a DNS is issued for any of the proposals listed in subsection B1 of this section, the requirements in this subsection shall be met. The requirements of this subsection do not apply to a DNS issued when the early review DNS process in Section 25.05.355 is used.

    1. An agency shall not act upon a proposal for fourteen (14) days after the date of issuance of a DNS if the proposal involves:

        1. Another agency with jurisdiction;
        2. Demolition of any structure or facility not exempted by Section 25.05.800 B6 (exempt construction other than historic) or Section 25.05.880 (Emergencies);
        3. Issuance of clearing or grading permits not exempted in Subchapter IX of these rules;
        4. A DNS under Section 25.05.350 B, Section 25.05.350 C (mitigated DNS) or Section 25.05.360 D (withdrawn DS); or
        5. A Growth Management Act (GMA) action.
    2. The responsible official shall send the DNS and environmental checklist to agencies with jurisdiction, the Department of Ecology, and affected tribes, the SEPA Public Information Center, and each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal, and shall give notice under Section 25.05.510.
    3. Any person, affected tribe, or agency may submit comments to the lead agency within fourteen (14) days of the date of issuance of the DNS.
    4. The date of issue for the DNS is the date the DNS is sent to the Department of Ecology and agencies with jurisdiction and the SEPA Public Information Center and is made publicly available.
    5. An agency with jurisdiction may assume lead agency status only within this fourteen (14) day period (Section 25.05.948).
    6. The responsible official shall reconsider the DNS based on timely comments and may retain or modify the DNS or, if the responsible official determines that significant adverse impacts are likely, withdraw the DNS or supporting documents. When a DNS is modified, the lead agency shall send the modified DNS to agencies with jurisdiction.
3. 1. The lead agency shall withdraw a DNS if:

    1. There are substantial changes to a proposal so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts;
    2. There is significant new information indicating a proposal's probable significant adverse environmental impacts; or
    3. The DNS was procured by misrepresentation or lack of material disclosure; if such DNS resulted from the actions of an applicant, any subsequent environmental checklist on the proposal shall be prepared directly by the lead agency or its consultant at the expense of the applicant.
    4. Subsection C1b shall not apply when a nonexempt license has been issued on a private project.
    5. If the lead agency withdraws a DNS, the agency shall make a new threshold determination and notify other agencies with jurisdiction of the withdrawal and new threshold determination, and any appeal fees paid shall be refunded. If a DS is issued, each agency with jurisdiction shall commence action to suspend, modify, or revoke any approvals until the necessary environmental review has occurred (see also Section 25.05.070 (limitations on actions during SEPA process)).

#### 25.05.350 - Mitigated DNS

The purpose of this section is to allow clarifications or changes to a proposal prior to making the threshold determination.


1. In making threshold determinations, an agency may consider mitigation measures that the agency or applicant will implement.
2. After submission of an environmental checklist and prior to the lead agency's threshold determination on a proposal, an applicant may ask the lead agency to indicate whether it is considering a DS. If the lead agency indicates a DS is likely, the applicant may clarify or change features of the proposal to mitigate the impacts which lead the agency to consider a DS likely. The applicant shall revise the environmental checklist as may be necessary to describe the clarifications or changes. The lead agency shall make its threshold determination based upon the changed or clarified proposal. If a proposal continues to have a probable significant adverse environmental impact, even with mitigation measures, an EIS shall be prepared.
3. Whether or not an applicant requests early notice under subsection B, if the lead agency specifies mitigation measures on an applicant's proposal that would allow it to issue a DNS, and the proposal is clarified, changed, or conditioned to include those measures, the lead agency shall issue a DNS. Mitigation measures specified by the lead agency may be based upon any adverse impacts revealed by the environmental checklist, and need not be limited to those permitted by agency SEPA policies. (Compare Section 25.05.660 A (substantive authority and mitigation).)
4. Environmental documents need not be revised and resubmitted if the clarifications or changes are stated in writing in documents that are attachments to, or incorporate by reference, the documents previously submitted. An addendum may be used, see Subchapter VI.
5. Agencies may clarify or change features of their own proposal, and may specify mitigation measures in their DNSs, as a result of comments by other agencies or the public or as a result of additional agency planning.
6. An agency's indication under this section that a DS appears likely shall not be construed as a determination of significance. Likewise, the preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal shall not bind the lead agency to a mitigated DNS.
7. Anyone violating or failing to comply with any mitigation measure imposed under this Section 25.05.350 shall be subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $500, and each day that anyone shall continue to violate or fail to comply with such measure after receiving notice of the violation shall be considered a separate offense. In addition, permits authorizing the work that is subject to the mitigation measure may be suspended or revoked.
8. As provided for in subsection 25.05.340.B.1.d, notice of a 14 day comment period, consistent with subsection 25.05.340.B, shall be issued concurrently with a mitigated DNS. No further action shall be taken until expiration of the comment period. Notice shall include information sufficient to inform the public of the mitigation proposed.

#### 25.05.355 - Early review DNS (optional DNS) process

1. Early Review DNS Process. If the City is lead agency for a proposal and has a reasonable basis for determining significant adverse environmental impacts are unlikely, the notice of application comment period may be used to obtain comments on both the notice of application and the likely threshold determination for the proposal.
2. If the lead agency uses the early review DNS process specified in subsection A of this Section 25.05.355, the lead agency shall:

    1. State on the first page of the notice of application that it expects to issue a DNS for the proposal, and that:

        1. The early review DNS process is being used;
        2. This will be the only opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of the proposal;
        3. The proposal may include mitigation measures under applicable codes, and the project review process may incorporate or require mitigation measures regardless of whether an EIS is prepared; and
        4. A copy of the subsequent threshold determination for the specific proposal may be obtained upon written request and provision of an address for notice;
    2. List in the notice of application the conditions being considered to mitigate environmental impacts, if a mitigated DNS is expected;
    3. Comply with the requirements for a notice of application and public notice in Sections 23.76.012, 23.76.042, and 23.76.062 of the Land Use Code; and
    4. Provide the notice of application and environmental checklist to:

        1. Agencies with jurisdiction, the Department of Ecology, affected tribes, and each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal, and
        2. Anyone who requests a copy of the environmental checklist for the specific proposal in writing and provides an address for notice.
3. If the lead agency indicates on the notice of application that a DNS is likely, an agency with jurisdiction may assume lead agency status during the comment period on the notice of application (Section 25.05.948).
4. The responsible official shall consider timely comments on the notice of application and either:

    1. Issue a DNS or mitigated DNS with no comment period using the procedures in subsection E of this section; or
    2. Issue a DS; or
    3. Require additional information or studies prior to making a threshold determination.
5. If a DNS or mitigated DNS is issued under subsection D1 of this section, the lead agency shall send a copy of the DNS or mitigated DNS to the Department of Ecology, affected tribes, agencies with jurisdiction, those who commented, and anyone requesting a copy. A copy of the environmental checklist need not be recirculated.

#### 25.05.360 - Determination of significance (DS)/initiation of scoping.

1. If the responsible official determines that a proposal may have a probable significant adverse environmental impact, the responsible official shall prepare and issue a determination of significance (DS) substantially in the form provided in Section 25.05.980. The DS shall describe the main elements of the proposal, the location of the site, if a site-specific proposal, and the main areas the lead agency has identified for discussion in the EIS. A copy of the environmental checklist may be attached.
2. If an agency adopts another environmental document in support of a threshold determination (Subchapter VI), the notice of adoption (Section 25.05.965) and the DS shall be combined or attached to each other.
3. The responsible official shall put the DS in the lead agency's file and shall commence scoping (Section 25.05.408) by circulating copies of the DS to the applicant, agencies with jurisdiction and expertise, if any, affected tribes, and to the public. Notice shall be given under Section 25.05.510. The lead agency is not required to scope if the agency is adopting another environmental document for the EIS or is preparing a supplemental EIS.
4. If at any time after the issuance of a DS a proposal is changed so, in the judgment of the lead agency, there are no probable significant adverse environmental impacts, the DS shall be withdrawn and a DNS issued instead. The DNS shall be sent to all who commented on the DS. A proposal shall not be considered changed until all license applications for the proposal are revised to conform to the changes or other binding commitments made by agencies or by applicants.

#### 25.05.390 - Effect of threshold determination.

1. When the responsible official makes a threshold determination, it is final and binding on all agencies, subject to the provisions of this section and Section 25.05.340 (DNS), Section 25.05.360 (Scoping), and Subchapter VI.
2. The responsible official's threshold determination:

    1. for proposals listed in Section 25.05.340 B, shall not be final until fourteen (14) days after issuance;
    2. Shall not apply if another agency with jurisdiction assumes lead agency status under Section 25.05.948;
    3. Shall not apply when withdrawn by the responsible official under Section 25.05.340 or Section 25.05.360;
    4. Shall not apply when reversed on appeal.
3. Regardless of any appeals, a DS or DNS issued by the responsible official may be considered final for purposes of other agencies' planning and decisionmaking unless subsequently changed, reversed, or withdrawn.


### Subchapter IV - Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
#### 25.05.400 - Purpose of EIS.

1. The primary purpose of an environmental impact statement is to ensure that SEPA's policies are an integral part of the ongoing programs and actions of state and local government.
2. An EIS shall provide impartial discussion of significant environmental impacts and shall inform decisionmakers and the public of reasonable alternatives, including mitigation measures, that would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance environmental quality.
3. Environmental impact statements shall be concise, clear, and to the point, and shall be supported by the necessary environmental analysis. The purpose of an EIS is best served by short documents containing summaries of, or reference to, technical data and by avoiding excessively detailed and overly technical information. The volume of an EIS does not bear on its adequacy. Larger documents may even hinder the decisionmaking process.
4. The EIS process enables government agencies and interested citizens to review and comment on proposed government actions, including government approval of private projects and their environmental effects. This process is intended to assist the agencies and applicants to improve their plans and decisions, and to encourage the resolution of potential concerns or problems prior to issuing a final statement. An environmental impact statement is more than a disclosure document. It shall be used by agency officials in conjunction with other relevant materials and considerations to plan actions and make decisions.

#### 25.05.402 - General requirements.

Agencies shall prepare environmental impact statements as follows:


1. EIS's need analyze only the reasonable alternatives and probable adverse environmental impacts that are significant. Beneficial environmental impacts or other impacts may be discussed.
2. The level of detail shall be commensurate with the importance of the impact, with less important material summarized, consolidated, or referenced.
3. Discussion of insignificant impacts is not required; if included, such discussion shall be brief and limited to summarizing impacts or noting why more study is not warranted.
4. Description of the existing environment and the nature of environmental impacts shall be limited to the affected environment and shall be no longer than is necessary to understand the environmental consequences of the alternatives, including the proposal.
5. EIS's shall be no longer than necessary to comply with SEPA and these rules. Length should relate first to potential environmental problems and then to the size or complexity of the alternatives, including the proposal.
6. The basic features and analysis of the proposal, alternatives, and impacts shall be discussed in the EIS and shall be generally understood without turning to other documents; however, an EIS is not required to include all information conceivably relevant to a proposal, and may be supplemented by appendices, reports, or other documents in the agency's record.
7. Agencies shall reduce paperwork and the accumulation of background data by adopting or incorporating by reference, existing, publicly available environmental documents, wherever possible.
8. Agencies shall prepare EIS's concurrently with and coordinated with environmental studies and related surveys that may be required for the proposal under other laws, when feasible.
9. EIS's shall serve as the means of assessing the environmental impact of proposed agency action, rather than justifying decisions already made.

#### 25.05.405 - EIS types.

Preparation of a SEIS shall be carried out as stated in 25.05.620.


1. Draft and final environmental impact statements (EIS's) shall be prepared; draft and final supplemental EIS's may be prepared.
2. A draft EIS (DEIS) allows the lead agency to consult with members of the public, affected tribes, and agencies with jurisdiction and expertise. The lead agency shall issue a DEIS and consider comments as stated in Subchapter V.
3. A final EIS (FEIS) shall revise the DEIS as appropriate and respond to comments as required in Section 25.05.560. An FEIS shall respond to opposing views on significant adverse environmental impacts and reasonable alternatives which the lead agency determines were not adequately discussed in the DEIS. The lead agency shall issue a FEIS as specified by Section 25.05.460.
4. A supplemental EIS (SEIS) shall be prepared as an addition to either a draft or final statement if:

    1. There are substantial changes to a proposal so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts; or
    2. There is significant new information indicating, or on, a proposal's probable significant adverse environmental impacts.
5. Agencies may use federal EIS's, as stated in Subchapter VI.

#### 25.05.406 - EIS timing.

The lead agency shall commence preparation of the environmental impact statement as close as possible to the time the agency is developing or is presented with a proposal, so that preparation can be completed in time for the final statement to be included in appropriate recommendations or reports on the proposal (Section 25.05.055). The statement shall be prepared early enough so it can serve practically as an important contribution to the decisionmaking process and will not be used to rationalize or justify decisions already made. EIS's may be "phased" in appropriate situations (Section 25.05.060 E).


#### 25.05.408 - Scoping.

1. The lead agency shall narrow the scope of every EIS to the probable significant adverse impacts and reasonable alternatives, including mitigation measures. For example, if there are only two (2) or three (3) significant impacts or alternatives, the EIS shall be focused on those.
2. To ensure that every EIS is concise and addresses the significant environmental issues, the lead agency shall:

    1. Invite agency, affected tribes, and public comment on the DS (Section 25.05.360 (DS/scoping)).

        1. If the agency requires written comments, agencies, affected tribes and the public shall be allowed twenty-one (21) days from the date of issuance of the DS in which to comment, unless expanded scoping is used.
        2. If the City issues the scoping notice with the notice of application under RCW 36.70B.110, the comment period shall be fourteen (14) days;
    2. Identify reasonable alternatives and probable significant adverse environmental impacts;
    3. Eliminate from detailed study those impacts that are not significant; and
    4. Work with other agencies to identify and integrate environmental studies required for other government approvals with the EIS, where feasible.
3. Agencies, affected tribes, and the public should comment promptly and as specifically as permitted by the details available on the proposal.
4. Meetings or scoping documents, including notices that the scope has been revised, may be used but are not required. The lead agency shall integrate the scoping process with its existing planning and decisionmaking process in order to avoid duplication and delay.
5. The lead agency shall revise the scope of an EIS if substantial changes are made later in the proposal, or if significant new circumstances or information arise that bear on the proposal and its significant impacts.
6. DEIS's shall be prepared according to the scope decided upon by the lead agency in its scoping process.
7. EIS preparation may begin during scoping.
8. The date of issuance for a DS is the date it is sent to the Department of Ecology and other agencies with jurisdiction, and is publicly available.

#### 25.05.409 - Scoping on City-sponsored projects.

1. When a City department is lead agency for a City project or non-project action and the department determines that an EIS is required for the project, the department shall hold a public scoping meeting to determine the range of proposed actions, alternatives, possible mitigating measures, and impacts to be discussed in an EIS (see Sections 25.05.510 and 25.05.535).
2. Depending on the size, timing, public comment, or other relevant aspects of the project, the lead agency may, at its option, expand scoping according to the provisions set forth in Section 25.05.410.

#### 25.05.410 - Expanded scoping (optional).

1. At its option, the lead agency may expand the scoping process to include any or all of the following, which may be applied on a proposal-by-proposal basis:

    1. Using questionnaires or information packets;
    2. Using meetings or workshops, which may be combined with any other early planning meetings of the agency;
    3. Using a coordinator or team from inside or outside the agency;
    4. Developing cooperative consultation and exchange of information among agencies before the EIS is prepared, rather than awaiting submission of comments on a completed document;
    5. Coordinating and integrating other government reviews and approvals with the EIS process through memoranda or other methods;
    6. Inviting participation of agencies with jurisdiction or expertise from various levels of government, such as regional or federal agencies;
    7. Using other methods as the lead agency may find helpful.
2. Use of expanded scoping is intended to promote interagency cooperation, public participation, and innovative ways to streamline the SEPA process. Steps shall be taken, as the lead agency determines appropriate, to encourage and assist public participation. There are no specified procedural requirements for the methods, techniques, or documents which may be used in an expanded scoping process, to provide maximum flexibility to meet these purposes.
3. The lead agency shall consult with an applicant prior to deciding the method and schedule for an expanded scoping process.
4. Under expanded scoping, an applicant may request, in which case the lead agency shall set, a date by which the lead agency shall determine the scope of the EIS, including the need for any field investigations (to the extent permitted by the details available on the proposal). The date shall occur thirty (30) days or less after the DS is issued, unless the lead agency and applicant agree upon a later date.

#### 25.05.420 - EIS preparation.

For draft and final EIS's and SEIS's:


1. Preparation of the EIS is the responsibility of the lead agency, by or under the direction of its responsible official, as specified by the lead agency's procedures. No matter who participates in the preparation of the EIS, it is the EIS of the lead agency. The responsible official, prior to distributing an EIS, shall be satisfied that it complies with these rules and the procedures of the lead agency.
2. The lead agency may have an EIS prepared by agency staff, an applicant or its agent, or by an outside consultant retained by either an applicant or the lead agency. In the event the responsible official determines that the applicant will be required to prepare an EIS, the applicant shall be so notified immediately after completion of the threshold determination. The lead agency shall assure that the EIS is prepared in a professional manner and with appropriate interdisciplinary methodology. The responsible official shall direct the areas of research and examination to be undertaken as a result of the scoping process, as well as the organization of the resulting document.
3. If a person other than the lead agency is preparing the EIS, the lead agency shall:

    1. Coordinate any scoping procedures so that the individual preparing the EIS receives all substantive information submitted by any agency or person;
    2. Assist in obtaining any information on file with another agency that is needed by the person preparing the EIS;
    3. Allow any party preparing an EIS access to all public records of the lead agency that relate to the subject of the EIS, under Chapter 42.17 RCW (Public Disclosure and Public Records Law).
4. In the event the responsible official or his designee is preparing an EIS, the responsible official may require a private applicant to provide data and information not in the possession of the City which is relevant to any or all areas to be covered by an EIS. However, a private applicant shall not be required to provide information which the lead agency has requested of a consulted agency until the consulted agency has responded, or the thirty (30) days allowed for response by the consulted agency has expired, whichever is earlier. An applicant may volunteer to provide any information or effort desired, as long as the EIS is supervised and approved by the responsible official. These rules do not prevent an agency from charging any fees which the agency is otherwise allowed to charge (Section 25.05.914).

#### 25.05.425 - Style and size.

1. Environmental impact statements shall be readable reports, which allow the reader to understand the most significant and vital information concerning the proposed action, alternatives, and impacts, without turning to other documents, as provided below and in Section 25.05.402 (general requirements).
2. Environmental impact statements shall be concise and written in plain language. EISs shall not be excessively detailed or overly technical. EISs shall explain plainly the meaning of technical terms not generally understood by the general public. This may be done in a glossary or footnotes or by some other means. EISs may include an index for ease in using the statement.
3. Most of the text of an environmental impact statement shall discuss and compare the environmental impacts and their significance, rather than describe the proposal and the environmental setting. Detailed descriptions may be included in appendices or supporting documents.
4. The text of an EIS (Section 25.05.430 C) normally ranges from thirty (30) to fifty (50) pages and may be shorter. The EIS text shall not exceed seventy-five (75) pages; except for proposals of unusual scope or complexity, where the EIS shall not exceed one hundred fifty (150) pages. Appendices and background material shall be bound separately from the EIS if they exceed twenty-five (25) pages, except if the entire document does not exceed one hundred (100) pages or a FEIS is issued under Section 25.05.560 E (DEIS and addendum).
5. If the lead agency decides that additional descriptive material or supporting documentation may be helpful for readers, this background information may be placed in appendices or in separate documents, and shall be readily available to agencies and the public during the comment period.
6. Agencies shall incorporate material into an environmental impact statement by reference to cut down on bulk, if an agency can do so without impeding agency and public review of the action (Sections 25.05.600 and 25.05.635).

#### 25.05.430 - Format.

1. A cover letter or memo from the lead agency shall precede the EIS (Section 25.05.435). A fact sheet (Section 25.05.440 A) shall be the first section of every EIS.
2. The following format should be used unless the lead agency determines that a different format would improve clear presentation of alternatives and environmental analysis for a particular proposal (except that the fact sheet shall always be the first section of an EIS):

    1. Fact sheet;
    2. Table of contents (may include the list of elements of the environment);
    3. Summary;
    4. Alternatives, including the proposed action;
    5. Affected environment, significant impacts, and mitigation measures (other than those included in the proposed action);
    6. Distribution list (may be included in appendix);
    7. Appendices, if any (including, for FEIS, comment letters and any separate responses).
3. EIS Text. The EIS text is divided into two (2) sections: B4 and B5 above. Agencies have wide latitude to organize and present material as they see fit within these two (2) basic sections. Agencies are not required to discuss each subject in Section 25.05.440 D and E and Section 25.05.444 in a separate section of the EIS.
4. Additional Format Considerations.

    1. Where relevant to the alternatives and impacts of proposal, the analysis specified in Section 25.05.440 shall be included regardless of the format of a particular statement.
    2. The format of a FEIS may differ, as specified by Section 25.05.560.
    3. Additional flexibility is provided in Sections 25.05.442 and 25.05.443 for environmental impact statements related to nonproject proposals.
    4. The elements of the environment for purposes of analyzing environmental impacts are stated in Section 25.05.444.
    5. Additional guidance on the distinction between environmental and other considerations is given in Sections 25.05.448 and 25.05.450.
    6. EISs may be combined with other documents (Section 25.05.640).

#### 25.05.435 - Cover letter or memo.

1. A cover letter or memo shall precede every EIS, but shall not be considered part of the EIS for adequacy purposes.
2. The cover letter or memo:

    1. Shall not exceed two (2) pages;
    2. Shall highlight the key environmental issues and options facing agency decisionmakers as known at the time of issuance;
    3. May include beneficial, as well as adverse environmental impacts and may mention other relevant considerations for decisionmakers;
    4. Shall identify, for SEISs, the EIS being supplemented.

#### 25.05.440 - EIS contents.

An EIS shall contain the following, in the style and format prescribed in the preceding sections.


1. Fact Sheet. The fact sheet shall include the following information in this order:

    1. A title and brief description (a few sentences) of the nature and location (by street address, if applicable) of the proposal, including principal alternatives;
    2. The name of the person or entity making the proposal(s) and the proposed or tentative date for implementation;
    3. The name and address of the lead agency, the responsible official, and the person to contact for questions, comments, and information;
    4. A list of all licenses which the proposal is known to require. The licenses shall be listed by name and agency; the list shall be as complete and specific as possible;
    5. Authors and principal contributors to the EIS and the nature or subject area of their contributions;
    6. The date of issue of the EIS;
    7. The date comments are due (for DEISs);
    8. The time and place of public hearings or meetings, if any and if known;
    9. The date final action is planned or scheduled by the lead agency, if known. Agencies may indicate that the date is subject to change. The nature or type of final agency action should be stated unless covered in subsection 1 above;
    10. The type and timing of any subsequent environmental review to which the lead agency or other agencies have made commitments, if any;
    11. The location of a prior EIS on the proposal, EIS technical reports, background data, adopted documents, and materials incorporated by reference for this EIS, if any;
    12. The cost to the public for a copy of the EIS.
2. Table of Contents.

    1. The table of contents should list, if possible, any documents which are appended, adopted, or serve as technical reports for this EIS (but need not list each comment letter).
    2. The table of contents may include the list of elements of the environment (Section 25.05.444), indicating those elements or portions of elements which do not involve significant impacts.
3. Summary. The EIS shall summarize the contents of the statement and shall not merely be an expanded table of contents. The summary shall briefly state the proposal's objectives, specifying the purpose and need to which the proposal is responding, the major conclusions, significant areas of controversy and uncertainty, if any, and the issues to be resolved, including the environmental choices to be made among alternative courses of action and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. The summary need not mention every subject discussed in the EIS, but shall include a summary of the proposal, impacts, alternatives, mitigation measures, and significant adverse impacts that cannot be mitigated. The summary shall state when the EIS is part of a phased review, if known, or the lead agency is relying on prior or future environmental review (which should be generally identified). The lead agency shall make the summary significantly broad to be useful to the other agencies with jurisdiction.
4. Alternatives Including the Proposed Action.

    1. This section of the EIS describes and presents the proposal (or preferred alternative, if one (1) or more exists) and alternative courses of action.
    2. Reasonable alternatives shall include actions that could feasibly attain or approximate a proposal's objectives, but at a lower environmental cost or decreased level of environmental degradation.

        1. The word "reasonable" is intended to limit the number and range of alternatives, as well as the amount of detailed analysis for each alternative.
        2. The "no-action" alternative shall be evaluated and compared to other alternatives.
        3. Reasonable alternatives may be those over which an agency with jurisdiction has authority to control impacts either directly, or indirectly through requirement of mitigation measures.
    3. This section of the EIS shall:

        1. Describe the objective(s), proponent(s), and principal features of reasonable alternatives. Include the proposed action, including mitigation measures that are part of the proposal;
        2. Describe the location of the alternatives including the proposed action, so that a lay person can understand it. Include a map, street address, if any, and legal description (unless long or in metes and bounds);
        3. Identify any phases of the proposal, their timing, and previous or future environmental analysis on this or related proposals, if known;
        4. Tailor the level of detail of descriptions to the significance of environmental impacts. The lead agency should retain any detailed engineering drawings and technical data, that have been submitted, in agency files and make them available on request;
        5. Devote sufficiently detailed analysis to each reasonable alternative to permit a comparative evaluation of the alternatives including the proposed action. The amount of space devoted to each alternative may vary. One (1) alternative (including the proposed action) may be used as a benchmark for comparing alternatives. The EIS may indicate the main reasons for eliminating alternatives from detailed study;
        6. Present a comparison of the environmental impacts of the reasonable alternatives, and include the no action alternative. Although graphics may be helpful, a matrix or chart is not required. A range of alternatives or a few representative alternatives, rather than every possible reasonable variation, may be discussed;
        7. Discuss the benefits and disadvantages of reserving for some future time the implementation of the proposal, as compared with possible approval at this time. The agency perspective should be that each generation is, in effect, a trustee of the environment for succeeding generations. Particular attention should be given to the possibility of foreclosing future options by implementing the proposal;
    4. When a proposal is for a private project on a specific site, the lead agency shall be required to evaluate only the no-action alternative plus other reasonable alternatives for achieving the proposal's objective on the same site. This subsection shall not apply when the proposal includes a rezone, unless the rezone is for a use allowed in an existing comprehensive plan that was adopted after review under SEPA. Further, alternative sites may be evaluated if other locations for the type of proposed use have not been included or considered in existing planning or zoning documents.
5. Affected Environment, Significant Impacts, and Mitigation Measures.

    1. This section of the EIS shall describe the existing environment that will be affected by the proposal, analyze significant impacts of alternatives including the proposed action, and discuss reasonable mitigation measures that would significantly mitigate these impacts. Elements of the environment that are not significantly affected need not be discussed. Separate sections are not required for each subject (see Section 25.05.430 C).
    2. General requirements for this section of the EIS.

        1. This section shall be written in a nontechnical manner which is easily understandable to lay persons whenever possible, with the discussion commensurate with the importance of the impacts. Only significant impacts must be discussed; other impacts may be discussed.
        2. Although the lead agency should discuss the affected environment, environmental impacts, and other mitigation measures together for each element of the environment where there is a significant impact, the responsible official shall have the flexibility to organize this section in any manner useful to decisionmakers and the public (see Section 25.05.430 C).
        3. This subsection is not intended to duplicate the analysis in subsection E and shall avoid doing so to the fullest extent possible.
    3. This section of the EIS shall:

        1. Succinctly describe the principal features of the environment that would be affected, or created, by the alternatives including the proposal under consideration. Inventories of species should be avoided, although rare, threatened, or endangered species should be indicated;
        2. Describe and discuss significant impacts that will narrow the range or degree of beneficial uses of the environment or pose long-term risks to human health or the environment, such as storage, handling, or disposal of toxic or hazardous material;
        3. Clearly indicate those mitigation measures (not described in the previous section as part of the proposal or alternatives), if any, that could be implemented or might be required, as well as those, if any, that agencies or applicants are committed to implement;
        4. Indicate what the intended environmental benefits of mitigation measures are for significant impacts, and may discuss their technical feasibility and economic practicability, if there is concern about whether a mitigation measure is capable of being accomplished. The EIS need not analyze mitigation measures in detail unless they involve substantial changes to the proposal causing significant adverse impacts, or new information regarding significant impacts, and those measures will not be subsequently analyzed under SEPA (see Section 25.05.660 B). An EIS may briefly mention nonsignificant impacts or mitigation measures to satisfy other environmental review laws or requirements covered in the same document (Section 25.05.402 H and Section 25.05.640);
        5. Summarize significant adverse impacts that cannot or will not be mitigated.
    4. This section shall incorporate, when appropriate:

        1. A summary of existing plans (for example: land use and shoreline plans) and zoning regulations applicable to the proposal, and how the proposal is consistent and inconsistent with them;
        2. Energy requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures, including more efficient use of energy, such as insulating, as well as the use of alternate and renewable energy resources;
        3. Natural or depletable resource requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures;
        4. Urban quality, historic and cultural resources, and the design of the built environment, including the reuse and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures.
    5. Significant impacts on both the natural environment and the built environment must be analyzed, if relevant (Section 25.05.444). This involves impacts upon and the quality of the physical surroundings, whether they are in wild, rural, or urban areas. Discussion of significant impacts shall include the cost of and effects on public services, such as utilities, roads, fire, and police protection, that may result from a proposal. EIS's shall also discuss significant environmental impacts upon land and shoreline use, which includes housing, physical blight, and significant impacts of projected population on environmental resources, as specified by RCW 43.21C.110(1)(d) and (f), as listed in Section 25.05.444.
    6. Analysis of the following social, cultural, and economic issues shall be included in every EIS unless eliminated by the scoping process (Section 25.05.408):

        1. Economic factors, including but not limited to employment, public investment, and taxation where appropriate, provided that this section shall not authorize the City to require disclosure of financial information relating to the private applicant or the private applicant's proposal;
        2. Regional, City, and neighborhood goals, objectives, and policies adopted or recognized by the appropriate local governmental authority prior to the time the proposal is initiated;
        3. The level of detail used in discussing these additional elements should be proportionate to the impacts the proposal may have if approved.
6. Appendices. Comment letters and responses shall be circulated with the FEIS as specified by Section 25.05.560. Technical reports and supporting documents need not be circulated with an EIS (Sections 25.05.425 D and 25.05.440 A11), but shall be readily available to agencies and the public during the comment period.
7. Additional Analysis. The lead agency may at its option include, in an EIS or appendix, the analysis of any impact relevant to the agency's decision, whether or not environmental. The inclusion of such analysis may be based upon comments received during the scoping process. The provision for combining documents may be used (Section 25.05.640). The EIS shall comply with the format requirements of this subchapter. The decision whether to include such information and the adequacy of any such additional analysis shall not be used in determining whether an EIS meets the requirements of SEPA.

#### 25.05.442 - Contents of EIS on nonproject proposals.

1. The lead agency shall have more flexibility in preparing EIS's on nonproject proposals, because there is normally less detailed information available on their environmental impacts and on any subsequent project proposals. The EIS may be combined with other planning documents.
2. The lead agency shall discuss impacts and alternatives in the level of detail appropriate to the scope of the nonproject proposal and to the level of planning for the proposal. Alternatives should be emphasized. In particular, agencies are encouraged to describe the proposal in terms of alternative means of accomplishing a stated objective (see Section 25.05.060 C). Alternatives including the proposed action should be analyzed at a roughly comparable level of detail, sufficient to evaluate their comparative merits (this does not require devoting the same number of pages in an EIS to each alternative).
3. If the nonproject proposal concerns a specific geographic area, site specific analyses are not required, but may be included for areas of specific concern. The EIS should identify subsequent actions that would be undertaken by other agencies as a result of the nonproject proposal, such as transportation and utility systems.
4. The EIS's discussion of alternatives for a comprehensive plan, community plan, or other areawide zoning or for shoreline or land use plans shall be limited to a general discussion of the impacts of alternate proposals for policies contained in such plans, for land use or shoreline designations, and for implementation measures. The lead agency is not required under SEPA to examine all conceivable policies, designations, or implementation measures but should cover a range of such topics. The EIS content may be limited to a discussion of alternatives which have been formally proposed or which are, while not formally proposed, reasonably related to the proposed plan.

#### 25.05.443 - EIS contents when prior nonproject EIS.

1. The provisions for phased review (Section 25.05.060 E) and use of existing environmental documents, Subchapter VI, apply to EIS's on nonproject proposals.
2. A nonproject proposal may be approved based on an EIS assessing its broad impacts. When a project is then proposed that is consistent with the approved nonproject action, the EIS on such a project shall focus on the impacts and alternatives including mitigation measures specific to the subsequent project and not analyzed in the nonproject EIS. The scope shall be limited accordingly. Procedures for use of existing documents shall be used as appropriate, see Subchapter VI.
3. When preparing a project EIS under the preceding subsection, the lead agency shall review the nonproject EIS to ensure that the analysis is valid when applied to the current proposal, knowledge, and technology. If it is not valid, the analysis shall be reanalyzed in the project EIS.

#### 25.05.444 - Elements of the environment.

        8. Sewer/solid waste;
        9. Other governmental services or utilities.
3. Elements May Be Combined. To simplify the EIS format, reduce paperwork and duplication, improve readability, and focus on the significant issues, some or all of the elements of the environment in Section 25.05.444 may be combined.

#### 25.05.448 - Relationship of EIS to other considerations.

1. SEPA contemplates that the general welfare, social, economic, and other requirements and essential considerations of state policy will be taken into account in weighing and balancing alternatives and in making final decisions. However, the environmental impact statement is not required to evaluate and document all of the possible effects and considerations of a decision or to contain the balancing judgments that must ultimately be made by the decisionmakers. Rather, an environmental impact statement analyzes environmental impacts and must be used by agency decisionmakers, along with other relevant considerations or documents, in making final decisions on a proposal. The EIS provides a basis upon which the responsible agency and officials can make the balancing judgment mandated by SEPA, because it provides information on the environmental costs and impacts. SEPA does not require that an EIS be an agency's only decisionmaking document.
2. The term "socioeconomic" is not used in the statute or in these rules because the term does not have a uniform meaning and has caused a great deal of uncertainty. Areas of urban environmental concern which must be considered are specified in RCW 43.21C.110(1)(f), the environmental checklist (Section 25.05.960) and Sections 25.05.440 and 25.05.444. (See Section 25.05.440 E6.)
3. Examples of information that are not required to be discussed in an EIS are: Methods of financing proposals, economic competition, profits and personal income and wages, and social policy analysis such as fiscal and welfare policies and nonconstruction aspects of education and communications. EIS's may include whether housing is low, middle, or high income.
4. Agencies have the option to combine EIS's with other documents or to include additional analyses in EIS's, that will assist in making decisions (Sections 25.05.440 G and 25.05.640). Agencies may use the scoping process to help identify issues of concern to citizens.

#### 25.05.450 - Cost-benefit analysis.

A cost-benefit analysis (Section 25.05.726) is not required by SEPA. If a cost-benefit analysis relevant to the choice among environmentally different alternatives is being considered by an agency for the proposal, it may be incorporated by reference or appended to the statement as an aid in evaluating the environmental consequences. For purposes of complying with SEPA, the weighing of the merits and drawbacks of the various alternatives need not be displayed in a monetary cost-benefit analysis and should not be when there are important qualitative considerations.


#### 25.05.455 - Issuance of DEIS.

1. A draft EIS shall be issued by the responsible official and sent to the following:

    1. The Department of Ecology (two (2) copies);
    2. Each federal agency with jurisdiction over the proposal;
    3. Each agency with jurisdiction over or environmental expertise on the proposal;
    4. Each city/county in which adverse environmental impacts identified in the EIS may occur, if the proposal were implemented;
    5. Each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal;
    6. The applicable local, area-wide, or regional agency, if any, that has been designated under federal law to conduct intergovernmental review and coordinate federal activities with state or local planning;
    7. Any person requesting a copy of the EIS from the lead agency (fee may be charged for DEIS, see Section 25.05.504);
    8. Any affected tribe;
    9. The SEPA Public Information Center.
2. The lead agency is encouraged to send a notice of availability or a copy of the DEIS to any person, organization or governmental agency that has expressed an interest in the proposal, is known by the lead agency to have an interest in the type of proposal being considered, or receives governmental documents (for example, local and regional libraries). This is not meant to duplicate subsection A7 of this section.
3. The lead agency should make additional copies available at its offices to be reviewed or obtained.
4. The date of issue is the date the DEIS is publicly available and sent to the Department of Ecology, other agencies with jurisdiction and the SEPA Public Information Center.
5. Notice that a DEIS is available shall be given under Section 25.05.510.
6. Any person or agency shall have thirty (30) days from the date of issue in which to review and comment upon the DEIS.
7. Upon request, the lead agency may grant an extension of up to fifteen (15) days to the comment period. Agencies and the public must request any extension before the end of the comment period.
8. The rules for notice, costs, commenting, and response to comments on EIS's are stated in Subchapter V of these rules.

#### 25.05.460 - Issuance of FEIS.

1. A final EIS (FEIS) shall be issued by the responsible official and sent to the Department of Ecology (two (2) copies), to all agencies with jurisdiction, to all agencies who commented on the DEIS, to the SEPA Public Information Center, and to anyone requesting a copy of the FEIS. (Fees may be charged for the FEIS, see Section 25.05.504.)
2. The responsible official shall send the FEIS, or a notice that the FEIS is available, to anyone who commented on the DEIS and to those who received but did not comment on the DEIS. If the agency receives petitions from a specific group or organization, a notice or EIS may be sent to the group or organization, a notice or EIS may be sent to the group and not to each petitioner. Failure to notify any individual under this subsection shall not affect the legal validity of an agency's SEPA compliance.
3. The lead agency should make additional copies available in its offices for review.
4. The date of issue is the date the FEIS, or notice of availability, is sent to the persons, agencies and SEPA Public Information Center specified in the preceding subsections and the FEIS is publicly available. Copies sent to the Department of Ecology shall satisfy the statutory requirement of availability to the Governor and to the Ecological Commission.
5. Agencies shall not act on a proposal for which an EIS has been required prior to seven (7) days after issuance of the EIS.
6. The lead agency shall issue the FEIS within sixty (60) days of the end of the comment period for the DEIS, unless the proposal is unusually large in scope, the environmental impact associated with the proposal is unusually complex, or extensive modifications are required to respond to public comments.
7. The form and content of the FEIS is specified in Section 25.05.560.


### Subchapter V - Commenting
#### 25.05.500 - Purpose of this subchapter.

This subchapter provides rules for:


1. Notice and public availability of environmental documents, especially environmental impact statements;
2. Consultation and comment by agencies and members of the public on environmental documents;
3. Public hearings and meetings; and
4. Lead agency response to comments and preparation of final environmental impact statements. Review, comment, and responsiveness to comments on a draft EIS are the focal point of the act's commenting process because the DEIS is developed as a result of scoping and serves as the basis for the final statement.

#### 25.05.502 - Inviting comment.

1. Involving Other Agencies and the Public. Agency efforts to involve other agencies and the public in the SEPA process should be commensurate with the type and scope of the environmental document.

11. Additional Notification. In addition to any required notice of circulation, agencies may use any other reasonable methods, to inform agencies and the public that environmental documents are available or that hearings will occur.
12. Combining Notices. Agencies may combine SEPA notices with other agency notices. However, the SEPA information must be identifiable.

#### 25.05.504 - Availability and cost of environmental documents.

Agencies shall waive the charge for one (1) copy of an environmental document (not including the SEPA Register) provided to a public interest organization.


1. SEPA documents required by these rules shall be retained by the lead agency and made available in accordance with Chapter 42.17 RCW.
2. The lead agency shall make copies of any environmental document available in accordance with Chapter 42.17 RCW, charging only those costs allowed plus mailing costs. However, no charge shall be levied for circulation of documents to other agencies as required by these rules.

#### 25.05.508 - State SEPA Register

1. The Department of Ecology (DOE) shall prepare a State SEPA Register that is web-based and updated daily, giving notice of all environmental documents required to be sent to the DOE under these rules, specifically:

    1. DNS's under subsection 25.05.340.B;
    2. DS's (scoping notices) under Section 25.05.408;
    3. EIS's under Sections 25.05.455, 25.05.460, 25.05.620, and 25.05.630;
    4. Notices of Action under RCW 43.21C.080 and 43.21C.087; and
    5. Notices of the early review DNS process under subsections 25.05.355.B and 25.05.355.E.
2. All agencies shall submit the environmental documents listed in subsection 25.05.508.A to DOE promptly and in accordance with procedures established by the DOE.
3. Agencies are encouraged to refer to the State SEPA Register for notice of SEPA documents that may affect them.
4. DOE is authorized by WAC 197-11-508:

    1. To establish the method for distributing the State SEPA Register, which may include listing on Internet, publishing and mailing to interested persons, or any other method deemed appropriate by DOE;
    2. To establish a reasonable format for the State SEPA Register;
    3. To charge a reasonable fee for the State SEPA Register as allowed by law, in at least the amount allowed by Chapter 42.17 RCW, from agencies, members of the public, and interested organizations.
5. Members of the public, citizen and community groups, and educational institutions are encouraged by WAC 197-11-508 to refer to the State SEPA Register for notice of SEPA actions that may affect them.

#### 25.05.510 - Public notice

1. Notice for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions. For proposals requiring a Master Use Permit (MUP) or Council Land Use Decision under Chapter 23.76, a notice of availability of environmental documents, administrative SEPA appeals and SEPA public hearings shall be given pursuant to Chapter 23.76. These notice procedures shall be in lieu of the requirements of subsections 25.05.510.C and 25.05.510.D. The general mailed releases (GMRs) constitute the City SEPA Register for these actions, as required by subsection 25.05.510.B.3, but do not satisfy publication in the SEPA Register as required by subsection 25.05.510.E.
2. SEPA Public Information Center

    1. The Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections is responsible for establishing and maintaining the City's SEPA Public Information Center at a location readily accessible to the public, and for making the existence and location of the Center known to the general public and City employees, and for satisfying the public information requirements of WAC 197-11-510.
    2. The following documents shall be maintained in the SEPA Public Information Center by the Department of Planning and Development for three years in either paper or electronic format:

        1. Copies of all determinations of significance and determinations of nonsignificance filed by the City;
        2. Copies of all EIS's prepared by or on behalf of the City;
        3. Copies of all decisions in administrative appeals wherein SEPA issues were raised;
        4. Copies of all adoption notices and addenda issued under Subchapter VI of these rules;
        5. Copies of all notices of Master Use Permit applications that are published in the LUIB;
        6. For City of Seattle-sponsored projects, any programmatic EISs adopted by the City.
    3. The City SEPA Register maintained by the Department of Construction and Inspections under subsection 25.05.510.A shall include the following information and shall be available at the SEPA Public Information Center or the Department of Planning and Development web page: For each proposal, its name, its location, a brief (one sentence or phrase) description of the nature of the proposal, the contact person or office from which further information may be obtained, and the following:

        1. A listing of all determinations of nonsignificance made by the City during the previous year; and
        2. A listing of all draft and final EIS's issued by or on behalf of the City, including on the listing the date by which comments shall be received on draft EISs, and the date for any related public hearing scheduled.
    4. The City SEPA register shall be kept current and maintained at the SEPA Public Information Center for public inspection. In addition, updates to the register shall be transmitted by mail or electronic mail once every week to those organizations and individuals who make written request. The Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections may charge a periodic fee for the service of mailing the registers or updates, which shall be reasonably related to the costs of reproduction and mailing.
    5. The documents required to be maintained at the SEPA Public Information Center shall be available for public inspection and copies of the documents shall be provided upon written request. The City shall charge a fee for copies in the manner provided by ordinance, and for the cost of mailing.
3. Notice of environmental documents. Notices of environmental documents shall be provided as follows:

    1. Submission to the SEPA Public Information Center pursuant to subsection 25.05.510.B.
    2. Publication in the LUIB. Publication shall include:

        1. The date by which comments shall be received including the appropriate location to file the comments.
        2. The date by which any applicable appeals shall be filed including the appropriate location to file the appeal.
    3. Publication in the City's Official newspaper.
    4. Publication in the State SEPA Register.
    5. Additional methods identified by specific Departments.
4. Publication in the State SEPA Register. Documents that are required to be sent to the Department of Ecology under these rules will be published in the State SEPA Register, which will also constitute a form of public notice. However, publication in the State SEPA Register shall not, in itself, be considered compliance with this Section 25.05.510.

#### 25.05.535 - Public hearings and meetings.

1. If a public hearing on the proposal is held under some other requirement of law, such hearing shall be open to consideration of the environmental impact of the proposal, together with any environmental document that is available. This does not require extension of the comment periods for environmental documents.
2. A public hearing shall be held on every draft EIS.
3. In all other cases a public hearing on the environmental impact of a proposal shall be held whenever the lead agency determines, in its sole discretion, that a public hearing would assist it in meeting its responsibility to implement the purposes and policies of SEPA and these rules.
4. Whenever a public hearing is held under subsection B of this section, it shall occur no earlier than twenty-one (21) days from the date the draft EIS is issued, nor later than fifty (50) days from its issuance. Notice shall be given under Section 25.05.502 F and as provided for a draft EIS in Section 25.05.510 D2 and may be combined with other agency notice.
5. If a public hearing is required under this chapter, it shall be open to discussion of all environmental documents and any written comments that have been received by the lead agency prior to the hearing. A copy of the environmental document shall be available at the public hearing.
6. Comments at public hearings should be as specific as possible (see Section 25.05.550).
7. Agencies and their designees may hold informal public meetings or workshops. Such gatherings may be more flexible than public hearings and are not subject to the above notice and similar requirements for public hearings.
8. Public meetings held by local governments under Chapter 36.70B RCW may be used to meet SEPA public hearing requirements as long as the requirements for public hearings in this section are met. A public hearing under this section need not be an open record hearing as defined in RCW 36.70B.020(3).

#### 25.05.545 - Effect of no comment.

1. Consulted Agencies. If a consulted agency does not respond with written comments within the time periods for commenting on environmental documents, the lead agency may assume that the consulted agency has no information relating to the potential impact of the proposal as it relates to the consulted agency's jurisdiction or special expertise. Any consulted agency that fails to submit substantive information to the lead agency in response to a draft EIS is thereafter barred from alleging any defects in the lead agency's compliance with Subchapter IV of these rules.
2. Other Agencies and the Public. Lack of comment by other agencies or members of the public on environmental documents, within the time periods specified by these rules, shall be construed as lack of objection to the environmental analysis, if the requirements of Section 25.05.510 (public notice) are met. Other agencies and the public shall comment in the manner specified in Section 25.05.550. Each commenting citizen need not raise all possible issues independently. Appeals to the Hearing Examiner are considered de novo; the only limitation is that the issues on appeal shall be limited to those cited in the notice of appeal. (See Section 25.05.680 B3.)

#### 25.05.550 - Specificity of comments.

1. Contents of Comments. Comments on an EIS, DNS, scoping notice or proposal shall be as specific as possible and may address either the adequacy of the environmental document or the merits of the alternatives discussed or both.
2. Documents Referenced. Commenters shall briefly describe the nature of any documents referenced in their comments, indicating the material's relevance, and should indicate where the material can be reviewed or obtained.
3. Methodology. When an agency criticizes a lead agency's predictive methodology, the commenting agency should describe, when possible, the alternative methodology which it prefers and why.
4. Additional Information. A consulted agency shall specify in its comments whether it needs additional information to fulfill other applicable environmental reviews or consultation requirements and what information it needs, to the extent permitted by the details available on the proposal.
5. Mitigation Measures. When an agency with jurisdiction objects to or expresses concerns about a proposal, it shall specify the mitigation measures, if any are possible, it considers necessary to allow an agency to grant or approve applicable licenses.
6. Comments by Other Agencies. Commenting agencies that are not consulted agencies shall specify any additional information or mitigation measures the commenting agency believes are necessary or desirable to satisfy its concerns.
7. Citizen Comments. Recognizing their generally more limited resources, members of the public shall make their comments as specific as possible and are encouraged to comment on methodology needed, additional information, and mitigation measures in the manner indicated in this section.
8. Responding to Comments. An agency shall consider and may respond to comments as the agency deems appropriate; the requirements for responding in a FEIS shall be met (Section 25.05.560).

#### 25.05.560 - FEIS response to comments.

The FEIS, consisting of the DEIS and the addendum, shall be issued under Section 25.05.460, except that only the addendum need be sent to anyone who received the DEIS.


1. The lead agency shall prepare a final environmental impact statement whenever a DEIS has been prepared, unless the proposal is withdrawn or indefinitely postponed. The lead agency shall consider comments on the proposal and shall respond by one (1) or more of the means listed below, including its response in the final statement. Possible responses are to:

    1. Modify alternatives including the proposed action;
    2. Develop and evaluate alternatives not previously given detailed consideration by the agency;
    3. Supplement, improve, or modify the analysis;
    4. Make factual corrections;
    5. Explain why the comments do not warrant further agency response, citing the sources, authorities, or reasons that support the agency's response and, if appropriate, indicate those circumstances that would trigger agency reappraisal or further response.
2. All substantive comments received on the draft statement shall be appended to the final statement or summarized, where comments are repetitive or voluminous, and the summary appended. If a summary of the comments is used, the names of the commenters shall be included (except for petitions).
3. In carrying out subsection A, the lead agency may respond to each comment individually, respond to a group of comments, cross-reference comments and corresponding changes in the EIS, or use other reasonable means to indicate an appropriate response to comments. When extensive corrections or revisions to the DEIS are made, the affected sections of the FEIS shall be rewritten in full, with corrections and revisions indicated by underlining, italics or other method.
4. If the lead agency does not receive any comments critical of the scope or content of the DEIS, the lead agency may so state in an updated fact sheet (Section 25.05.440 A), which shall be circulated under Section 25.05.460. The FEIS shall consist of the DEIS and updated fact sheet.
5. If changes in response to comments are minor and are largely confined to the responses described in subsections A4 and A5 of this section, agencies may prepare and attach an addendum, which shall consist of the comments, the responses, the changes, and an updated fact sheet.
6. An FEIS shall be issued and circulated under Section 25.05.460.

#### 25.05.570 - Consulted agency costs to assist lead agency.

A consulted agency shall not charge the lead agency for any costs incurred in complying with Section 25.05.550, including providing relevant data to the lead agency and copying documents for the lead agency. This section shall not prohibit a consulted agency from charging those costs allowed by Chapter 42.17 RCW and SMC Section 3.104.010 for copying any environmental document requested by an agency other than the lead agency or by an individual or private organization. This section does not prohibit agencies from making interagency agreements on cost or personnel sharing to provide environmental information to each other.



### Subchapter VI - Using Existing Environmental Documents
#### 25.05.600 - When to use existing environmental documents.

1. This section contains criteria for determining whether an environmental document must be used unchanged and describes when existing documents may be used to meet all or part of an agency's responsibilities under SEPA.
2. An agency may use environmental documents that have previously been prepared in order to evaluate proposed actions, alternatives, or environmental impacts, provided that the information in the existing document(s) is accurate and reasonably up-to-date. The proposals may be the same as, or different than, those analyzed in the existing documents.
3. Any agency acting on the same proposal shall use an environmental document unchanged, except in the following cases:

    1. For DNS's, an agency with jurisdiction is dissatisfied with the DNS, in which case it may assume lead agency status (Section 25.05.340 B, C and Section 25.05.948).
    2. For DNS's and EIS's, preparation of a new threshold determination or supplemental EIS is required if there are:

        1. Substantial changes to a proposal so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts (or lack of significant adverse impacts, if a DS is being withdrawn); or
        2. New information indicating a proposal's probable significant adverse environmental impacts. (This includes discovery of misrepresentation or lack of material disclosure.) A new threshold determination or SEIS is not required if probable significant adverse environmental impacts are covered by the range of alternatives and impacts analyzed in the existing environmental documents.
    3. For EIS's, the agency concludes that its written comments on the DEIS warrant additional discussion for purposes of its action than that found in the lead agency's FEIS (in which case the agency may prepare a supplemental EIS at its own expense).
4. Existing documents may be used for a proposal by employing one (1) or more of the following methods:

    1. "Adoption," where an agency may use all or part of an existing environmental document to meet its responsibilities under SEPA. Agencies acting on the same proposal for which an environmental document was prepared are not required to adopt the document; or
    2. "Incorporation by reference," where an agency preparing an environmental document includes all or part of an existing document by reference;
    3. An addendum, that adds analyses or information about a proposal but does not substantially change the analysis of significant impacts and alternatives in the existing environmental document; or
    4. Preparation of a SEIS if there are:

        1. Substantial changes so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts, or
        2. New information indicating a proposal's probable significant adverse environmental impacts.
    5. If a proposal is substantially similar to one covered in an existing EIS, that EIS may be adopted; additional information may be provided in an addendum or SEIS (see D3 and 4 of this subsection).

#### 25.05.610 - Use of NEPA documents

1. An agency may adopt any environmental analysis prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by following Section 25.05.600 (when to use existing environmental documents) and Section 25.05.630 (adoption procedures).
2. A NEPA environmental assessment (EA) or documented categorical exclusion may be adopted to support a determination of nonsignificance instead of preparing an environmental checklist, if the requirements of Sections 25.05.340, 25.05.600, and 25.05.630 (and Sections 25.05.350 and 25.05.355 as applicable), are met and elements of the environment in Section 25.05.444 are adequately addressed.
3. An agency may adopt a NEPA EIS as a substitute for preparing a SEPA EIS if:

    1. The requirements of Sections 25.05.360, 25.05.600, and 25.05.630 are met (in which case the procedures in Subchapters III, IV, and V of these rules for preparing an EIS shall not apply); and
    2. The federal EA or EIS is not found inadequate:

        1. By a court;
        2. By the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (or is at issue in a predecision referral to CEQ) under the NEPA regulations; or
        3. By the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency under Section 309 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 1857.
4. Subsequent use by another agency of a federal EIS, adopted under subsection 25.05.610.C, for the same (or substantially the same) proposal does not require adoption, unless the criteria in subsection 25.05.600.D are met.
5. If the lead agency has not held a public hearing within its jurisdiction to obtain comments on the adequacy of adopting a federal environmental document as a substitute for preparing a SEPA EIS, a public hearing for such comments shall be held if, within 30 days of circulating its statement of adoption, a written request is received from at least 50 persons who reside within the agency's jurisdiction or are adversely affected by the environmental impact of the proposal. The agency shall reconsider its adoption of the federal document in light of public hearing comments.

#### 25.05.620 - Supplemental environmental impact statement—Procedures.

1. An SEIS shall be prepared in the same way as a draft and final EIS (Sections 25.05.400 to 25.05.600), except that scoping is optional. The SEIS should not include analysis of actions, alternatives, or impacts that is in the previously prepared EIS.
2. The fact sheet and cover letter or memo for the SEIS shall indicate the EIS that is being supplemented.
3. Unless the SEPA lead agency wants to prepare the SEIS, an agency with jurisdiction which needs the SEIS for its action shall be responsible for SEIS preparation.

#### 25.05.625 - Addenda—Procedures.

1. An addendum shall clearly identify the proposal for which it is written and the environmental document it adds to or modifies.
2. An agency is not required to prepare a draft addendum.
3. An addendum for a DEIS shall be circulated to recipients of the initial DEIS under Section 25.05.455.
4. If an addendum to a final EIS is prepared prior to any agency decision on a proposal, the addendum shall be circulated to the recipients of the final EIS.
5. Agencies shall circulate notice of addendum availability to interested persons. Unless otherwise provided in these rules, however, agencies are not required to circulate an addendum.
6. Any person, affected tribe, or agency may submit comments to the lead agency within fifteen (15) days of the date of issuance of an addendum.

#### 25.05.630 - Adoption—Procedures.

1. The agency adopting an existing environmental document must independently review the content of the document and determine that it meets the adopting agency's environmental review standards and needs for the proposal. However, a document is not required to meet the adopting agency's own procedures for the preparation of environmental documents (such as circulation, commenting, and hearing requirements) to be adopted.
2. An agency shall adopt an environmental document by identifying the document and stating why it is being adopted, using the adoption form substantially as in Section 25.05.965. The adopting agency shall ensure that the adopted document is readily available to agencies and the public by:

    1. Sending a copy to agencies with jurisdiction that have not received the document, as shown by the distribution list for the adopted document; and
    2. Placing copies in libraries and other public offices, or by distributing copies to those who request one; and
    3. Placing a copy in the SEPA Public Information Center.
3. When an existing EIS is adopted and:

    1. A supplemental environmental impact statement or addendum is not being prepared, the agency shall circulate its statement of adoption as follows:

        1. The agency shall send copies of the adoption notice to the Department of Ecology, to agencies with jurisdiction, to cities/counties in which the proposal will be implemented, to the SEPA Public Information Center, and to local agencies or political subdivisions whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal.
        2. The agency is required to send the adoption notice to persons or organizations that have expressed an interest in the proposal or are known by the agency to have an interest in the type of proposal being considered, or the lead agency should announce the adoption in agency newsletters or through other means.
        3. No action shall be taken on the proposal until seven (7) days after the statement of adoption has been issued. The date of issuance shall be the date the statement of adoption has been sent to the Department of Ecology, the SEPA Public Information Center, and other agencies and is publicly available.
    2. A SEIS is being prepared, the agency shall include the statement of adoption in the SEIS; or
    3. An addendum is being prepared, the agency shall include the statement of adoption with the addendum and circulate both as in subsection C1 of this section.
4. A copy of the adopted document must accompany the current proposal to the decisionmaker; the statement of adoption may be included.
5. When a previous document (DNS or EIS) is adopted pursuant to this section and applied to a new project for which a decision has not been issued, the document can be appealed as an element of SEPA compliance for the new project (see Section 25.05.680 for appeal procedures and Section 25.05.510 for notice requirements).
6. Departments shall not adopt a portion of a document if the adequacy of that portion has been appealed to the City Hearing Examiner and is either pending the Hearing Examiner's decision or has been found by the Hearing Examiner to be inadequate. This does not preclude adoption of portions of the document which have not been challenged.

#### 25.05.635 - Incorporation by reference—Procedures.

1. Agencies should use existing studies and incorporate material by reference whenever appropriate.
2. Material incorporated by reference (1) shall be cited, its location identified, and its relevant content briefly described; and (2) shall be made available for public review during applicable comment periods.

#### 25.05.640 - Combining documents.

The SEPA process shall be combined with the existing planning, review, and project approval processes being used by each agency with jurisdiction. When environmental documents are required, they shall accompany a proposal through the existing agency review processes. Any environmental document in compliance with SEPA may be combined with any other agency documents to reduce duplication and paperwork and improve decisionmaking. The page limits in these rules shall be met, or the combined document shall contain, at or near the beginning of the document, a separate summary of environmental considerations, as specified by Section 25.05.440 C. SEPA page limits need not be met for joint state-federal EIS's prepared under both SEPA and NEPA, in which case the NEPA page restrictions (40 CFR 1502.7) shall apply.



### Subchapter VII - SEPA and Agency Decisions
#### 25.05.650 - Purpose of this subchapter.

The purpose of this subchapter is to:


1. Ensure the use of concise, high quality environmental documents and information in making decisions;
2. Integrate the SEPA process with other laws and decisions;
3. Encourage actions that preserve and enhance environmental quality, consistent with other essential considerations of state policy;
4. Provide basic, uniform principles for the exercise of substantive authority and appeals under SEPA.

#### 25.05.655 - Implementation.

1. See RCW 43.21C.020, 43.21C.030(1), 43.21C.060, 43.21C.075, and 43.21C.080.
2. Relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses shall accompany proposals through existing agency review processes, as determined by agency practice and procedure, so that agency officials use them in making decisions.
3. When a decisionmaker considers a final decision on a proposal:

    1. The alternatives in the relevant environmental documents shall be considered.
    2. The range of alternative courses of action considered by decisionmakers shall be within the range of alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents. However, mitigation measures adopted need not be identical to those discussed in the environmental document.
    3. If information about alternatives is contained in another decision document which accompanies the relevant environmental documents to the decisionmaker, agencies are encouraged to make that information available to the public before the decision is made.

#### 25.05.660 - Substantive authority and mitigation.

1. Any governmental action on public or private proposals that are not exempt may be conditioned or denied under SEPA to mitigate the environmental impact subject to the following limitations:

    1. Mitigation measures or denials shall be based on policies, plans, rules, or regulations formally designated in Sections 25.05.665, 25.05.670 and 25.05.675 as a basis for the exercise of substantive authority and in effect when the DNS or DEIS is issued. (Compare Section 25.05.350 C).
    2. Mitigation measures shall be related to specific, adverse environmental impacts clearly identified in an environmental document on the proposal and shall be stated in writing by the decisionmaker. The decisionmaker shall cite the City's SEPA policy that is the basis of any condition or denial under this chapter (for proposals of applicants). After its decision, each agency shall make available to the public a document that states the decision. The document shall state the mitigation measures, if any, that will be implemented as part of the decision, including any monitoring of environmental impacts. Such a document may be the license itself, or may be combined with other agency documents, or may reference relevant portions of environmental documents.
    3. Mitigation measures shall be reasonable and capable of being accomplished.
    4. Responsibility for implementing mitigation measures may be imposed upon an applicant only to the extent attributable to the identified adverse impacts of its proposal. Voluntary additional mitigation may occur.
    5. Before requiring mitigation measures, agencies shall consider whether local, state, or federal requirements and enforcement would mitigate an identified significant impact.
    6. To deny a proposal under SEPA, an agency must find that:

        1. The proposal would be likely to result in significant adverse environmental impacts identified in a final or supplemental environmental impact statement prepared under this chapter; and
        2. Reasonable mitigation measures are insufficient to mitigate the identified impact.
    7. If, during project review, the City as lead agency determines that the requirements for environmental analysis, protection, and mitigation measures in the City's development regulations, or in other applicable local, state or federal laws or rules, provide adequate analysis of and mitigation for the specific adverse environmental impacts of the project action under RCW 43.21C.240, the City as lead agency shall not impose additional mitigation under this chapter.
2. Decisionmakers should judge whether possible mitigation measures are likely to protect or enhance environmental quality. EISs should briefly indicate the intended environmental benefits of mitigation measures for significant impacts (Section 25.05.440 E). EISs are not required to analyze in detail the environmental impacts of mitigation measures, unless the mitigation measures:

    1. Represent substantial changes in the proposal so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts, or involve significant new information indicating, or on, a proposal's probable significant adverse environmental impacts; and
    2. Will not be analyzed in a subsequent environmental document prior to their implementation.
3. The City Clerk shall prepare a document that contains the City's SEPA policies (Sections 25.05.665, 25.05.670 and 25.05.675) so that applicants and members of the public know what these policies are. This document (and any documents referenced in it) shall be readily available to the public and shall be available to applicants prior to preparing a draft EIS.
4. Required mitigation measures or denials under this section shall be an additional ground for or issue in appeals of decisions otherwise provided by City ordinance; provided that for proposals involving more than one (1) action, such issue may be raised only with regard to the first decision which weighed the environmental impacts of the proposal or, the first decision of each phase if phased review is employed.

#### 25.05.665 - SEPA policies—Overview.

Provided that the authority and conditions based upon an existing plan do not exceed the limitations contained in the cumulative effects policy and the specific environmental policies contained in Sections 25.05.670 and 25.05.675 of this chapter, respectively; and


1. All Plans. SEPA conditions based upon a neighborhood or business district plan shall be consistent with any rezone action taken by the City Council subsequent to the adoption of the plan.

1. Purpose of the SEPA Policies.

    1. It is the City's policy to protect the environment and provide for reasonable property development while enhancing the predictability of land use regulation. In order to provide predictability, it is the City's intent to incorporate environmental concerns into its codes and development regulations to the maximum extent possible. However, comprehensive land use controls and other regulations cannot always anticipate or effectively mitigate all adverse environmental impacts.
    2. The policies set forth in this part of the SEPA Rules shall serve as the basis for exercising substantive SEPA authority pursuant to SMC Section 25.05.660. Based on these policies, a decisionmaker may condition a proposal to reduce or eliminate its environmental impacts. The decisionmaker may deny a proposed project if an environmental impact statement has been prepared and if reasonable mitigating measures are insufficient to mitigate significant, adverse impacts identified in the environmental impact statement. Conditioning or denial of project proposals will occur pursuant to RCW 43.21C.060, WAC 197-11-660 and SMC Section 25.05.660.
2. Relationship to Other City Policies. Nothing in these SEPA policies shall diminish the independent effect and authority of other environmentally related policies adopted by the City. Such City policies shall be considered together with these SEPA policies to guide discretionary land use decisions such as conditional uses and legislative actions such as rezones, adoption of area plans and siting of City facilities. Such adopted City policies may serve as the basis for exercising substantive SEPA authority with respect to a project only to the extent that they are explicitly referenced herein.
3. Relationship to Neighborhood and Business District Plans. Neighborhood and business district plans which have been adopted by the City Council may serve as the basis for exercising substantive SEPA authority, subject to the following:

    1. New Plans. A plan approved subsequent to the passage of this chapter may serve as the basis of exercising substantive SEPA authority only to the extent that the provisions of the plan explicitly identify any of its elements intended to have application for SEPA purposes.
    2. Existing Plans. A plan existing prior to the date of passage of this chapter may be used as a basis for the exercise of substantive SEPA authority only to the extent that:

        1. The plan identifies unusual circumstances such as substantially different site size or shape, topography, or inadequate infrastructure which would result in adverse environmental impacts which substantially exceed those anticipated by the code or zoning, or
        2. The plan establishes a different balance of environmental and other goals than is characteristic of the land use code as a whole;
4. Relationship to City Codes. Many environmental concerns have been incorporated in the City's codes and development regulations. Where City regulations have been adopted to address an environmental impact, it shall be presumed that such regulations are adequate to achieve sufficient mitigation subject to the limitations set forth in subparagraphs D1 through D7 below. Unless otherwise specified in the Policies for Specific Elements of the Environment (SMC Section 25.05.675), denial or mitigation of a project based on adverse environmental impacts shall be permitted only under the following circumstances:

    1. No City code or regulation has been adopted for the purpose of mitigating the environmental impact in question; or
    2. The applicable City code or regulation has been judicially invalidated; or
    3. The project site presents unusual circumstances such as substantially different site size or shape, topography, or inadequate infrastructure which would result in adverse environmental impacts which substantially exceed those anticipated by the applicable City code or zoning; or
    4. The development proposal presents unusual features, such as unforeseen design, new technology, or a use not identified in the applicable City code, which would result in adverse environmental impacts which substantially exceed those anticipated by the applicable City code or zoning; or
    5. The project is located near the edge of a zone, and results in substantial problems of transition in scale or use which were not specifically addressed by the applicable City code or zoning; or
    6. The project is vested to a regulation which no longer reflects the City's policy with respect to the relevant environmental impact because of the adoption of more recent policies, provided that the new policies are in effect prior to the issuance of a DNS or DEIS for the project; or
    7. The project creates undue impacts based on cumulative effects as provided for in SMC Section 25.05.670.
5. Relationship to Federal, State and Regional Regulations. Many of the environmental impacts addressed by these SEPA policies are also the subject of federal, state and regional regulations. In deciding whether these regulations provide sufficient impact mitigation, the City shall consult orally or in writing with the responsible federal, state or other agency with jurisdiction and environmental expertise and may expressly defer to that agency. The City shall base or condition its project decision on compliance with these other existing rules or laws. The City shall not so defer if such regulations did not anticipate or are otherwise inadequate to address a particular impact of a project.

#### 25.05.670 - Cumulative effects policy.

1. Policy Background.

    1. A project or action which by itself does not create undue impacts on the environment may create undue impacts when combined with the cumulative effects of prior or simultaneous developments; further, it may directly induce other developments, due to a causal relationship, which will adversely affect the environment.
    2. An individual project may have an adverse impact on the environment or public facilities and services which, though acceptable in isolation, could not be sustained given the probable development of subsequent projects with similar impacts.
2. Policies.

    1. The analysis of cumulative effects shall include a reasonable assessment of:

        1. The present and planned capacity of such public facilities as sewers, storm drains, solid waste disposal, parks, schools, streets, utilities, and parking areas to serve the area affected by the proposal;
        2. The present and planned public services such as transit, health, police and fire protection and social services to serve the area affected by the proposal;
        3. The capacity of natural systems-such as air, water, light, and land-to absorb the direct and reasonably anticipated indirect impacts of the proposal; and
        4. The demand upon facilities, services and natural systems of present, simultaneous and known future development in the area of the project or action.
    2. Subject to the policies for specific elements of the environment (SMC 25.05.675), an action or project may be conditioned or denied to lessen or eliminate its cumulative effects on the environment:

        1. When considered together with prior, simultaneous or induced future development; or
        2. When, taking into account known future development under established zoning, it is determined that a project will use more than its share of present and planned facilities, services and natural systems.
3. Unless otherwise specified in the Policies for Specific Elements of the Environment (SMC 25.05.675), if the scope of substantive SEPA authority is limited with respect to a particular element of the environment, the authority to mitigate that impact in the context of cumulative effects is similarly limited.

#### 25.05.675 - Specific environmental policies

provided, that mitigating measures shall not include reductions in a project's gross floor area.


1. On sites with potential archaeological significance, the decisionmaker may require an assessment of the archaeological potential of the site. Subject to the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665, mitigating measures which may be required to mitigate adverse impacts to an archaeological site include, but are not limited to:

    1. Relocation of the project on the site;
    2. Providing markers, plaques, or recognition of discovery;
    3. Imposing a delay of as much as ninety (90) days (or more than ninety (90) days for extraordinary circumstances) to allow archaeological artifacts and information to be analyzed; and
    4. Excavation and recovery of artifacts.

1. Air Quality.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. Air pollution can be damaging to human health, plants and animals, visibility, aesthetics, and the overall quality of life.
        2. Seattle's air quality is adversely affected primarily by vehicular emissions which create "hot spots" and nonattainment areas (such as downtown Seattle, Northgate, and the University District) that are identifiable through quarterly monitoring.
        3. Seattle's air quality is also affected by particulates from industries, power plants, and wood stoves, the burning of toxics or wastes, and other emissions, including odor impacts.
        4. Federal auto emission controls, the state inspection/maintenance program, and public transportation improvements are the primary means of mitigating air quality impacts from motor vehicles.
        5. The Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency is responsible for monitoring air quality in the Seattle area, setting standards and regulating development to achieve regional air quality goals.
        6. Federal, state and regional regulations and programs cannot always anticipate or adequately mitigate adverse air quality impacts.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse air quality impacts.
        2. For any project proposal which has a substantial adverse effect on air quality, the decisionmaker shall, in consultation with appropriate agencies with expertise, assess the probable effect of the impact and the need for mitigating measures. "Nonattainment areas" identified by the Puget Sound Air Pollution Control Agency shall be given special consideration.
        3. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC 25.05.665, if the decisionmaker makes a written finding that the applicable federal, state and/or regional regulations did not anticipate or are inadequate to address the particular impact(s) of the project, the decisionmaker may condition or deny the proposal to mitigate its adverse impacts.
        4. Mitigating measures may include but are not limited to:

            1. The use of alternative technologies, including toxic air control technologies;
            2. Controlling dust sources with paving, landscaping, or other means;
            3. Berming, buffering and screening;
            4. Landscaping and/or retention of existing vegetation; and
            5. A reduction in size or scope of the project or operation.
2. Construction Impacts.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. For many projects, the construction process itself creates temporary adverse impacts on the site and the surrounding area.
        2. Seattle's Street Use Ordinance, Building Code and Environmentally Critical Areas Ordinance are intended to address many of the impacts caused by the construction process. The codes may not, however, adequately address all construction impacts such as those relating to pedestrian flow and safety due to sidewalk and street closures, excessive mud and dust, noise, drainage, increased truck traffic, erosion, water quality degradation, and habitat disruption.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent temporary adverse impacts associated with construction activities.
        2. The decisionmaker may require, as part of the environmental review of a project, an assessment of noise, drainage, erosion, water quality degradation, habitat disruption, pedestrian circulation and transportation, and mud and dust impacts likely to result from the construction phase.
        3. Based on such assessments, the decisionmaker may, subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665, condition or deny a project to mitigate adverse impacts of the construction process.
        4. Noise. Mitigating measures to address adverse noise impacts during construction include, but are not limited to:

            1. Limiting the hours of construction;
            2. Specifying the time and duration of loud noise;
            3. Specifying a preferred type of construction equipment; and
            4. Requiring sound buffering and barriers.
        5. Drainage. Mitigating measures to address adverse drainage impacts during construction may include, but are not limited to:

            1. Sedimentation traps and filters;
            2. Sedimentation tanks or ponds;
            3. Oil separators;
            4. Retention facilities;
            5. Maintenance programs;
            6. Performance bonds; and
            7. Nondisturbance areas.
        6. Pedestrian Circulation. Mitigating measures to address adverse impacts relating to pedestrian circulation during construction may include, but are not limited to:

            1. Covered sidewalks or alternate safe, convenient and adequate pedestrian routes; and
            2. Limits on the duration of disruptions to pedestrian flow.
        7. Transportation. Mitigating measures to address transportation impacts during construction may include, but are not limited to:

            1. A construction phase transportation plan which addresses ingress and egress of construction equipment and construction worker vehicles at the project site;
            2. Traffic control and street maintenance in the vicinity of the construction site;
            3. Rerouting of public vehicular and pedestrian circulation in the vicinity of the construction site;
            4. Providing a temporary High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) incentive program for construction workers at the site to reduce the number of their vehicles taking parking places in the vicinity of the construction site; and
            5. HOV discounts for members of the public who were displaced from a traditional parking area by the construction activity.
3. Drainage.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. Property development and redevelopment often create increased volumes and rates of stormwater runoff, which may cause property damage, safety hazards, nuisance problems and water quality degradation.
        2. Pollution, mechanical damage, excessive flows, and other conditions in drainage basins will increase the rate of down-cutting and/or the degree of turbidity, siltation, habitat destruction, and other forms of pollution in wetlands, riparian corridors and lakes. They may also reduce low flows or low water levels to a level which endangers aquatic or benthic life within these wetlands, riparian corridors and lakes.
        3. The aesthetic quality and educational value of the water and watercourses, as well as the suitability of waters for contact recreation and wildlife habitat, may be destroyed.
        4. Authority provided through the Stormwater Code (Chapters 22.800 through 22.808) and Regulations for Environmentally Critical Areas (Chapter 25.09) is intended to achieve mitigation of drainage impacts in most cases, although these ordinances may not anticipate or eliminate all impacts.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to protect wetlands, riparian corridors, lakes, drainage basins, wildlife habitat, slopes, and other property from adverse drainage impacts.
        2. The decisionmaker may condition or deny projects to mitigate their adverse drainage impacts consistent with the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665; provided, that in addition to projects which meet one or more of the threshold criteria set forth in the Overview Policy, the following may be conditioned or denied:

            1. Projects located in environmentally critical areas and areas tributary to them;
            2. Projects located in areas where downstream drainage facilities are known to be inadequate; and
            3. Projects draining into streams identified by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife as bearing anadromous fish.
        3. To mitigate adverse drainage impacts associated with the projects identified in the policy set forth above in subsection 25.05.675.C.2, projects may be required to provide drainage control measures designed to a higher standard than the design storm specified in the Stormwater Code (Chapters 22.800 through 22.808) and the Environmentally Critical Areas Ordinance. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

            1. Reducing the size or scope of the project;
            2. Requiring landscaping and/or retention of existing vegetation;
            3. Requiring additional drainage control or drainage improvements either on or off site; and
            4. Soil stabilization measures.
4. Earth.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. Property development and redevelopment sometimes contribute to landslides, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence, and abnormal erosion. They may also be subject to seismic hazards such as strong ground motion and liquefaction.
        2. The Grading Code (Chapter 22.170) was specifically developed to prevent or minimize impacts resulting from earth fills and excavations and the Environmentally Critical Areas Ordinance was developed to minimize impacts resulting from activity in environmentally critical areas; however, these ordinances may not anticipate or adequately mitigate such impacts in all cases.
        3. Drainage impacts, which are closely related to earth movement hazards, are addressed separately in subsection C of these policies.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to protect life and property from loss or damage by landslides, strong ground motion and soil liquefaction, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence, abnormal erosion, and other hazards related to earth movement and instability.
        2. The decisionmaker may condition or deny projects to mitigate impacts related to earth movement or earth instability consistent with the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665; provided, that in addition to projects which meet one (1) or more of the threshold criteria set forth in the Overview Policy, projects located in environmentally sensitive areas and areas tributary to them may be conditioned or denied.
        3. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

            1. Reducing the size or scope of the operation or project;
            2. Limiting the duration of the project or the hours of operation;
            3. Requiring landscaping, the retention of existing vegetation or revegetation of the site;
            4. Requiring additional drainage-control measures or drainage facilities;
            5. Requiring water quality and erosion controls on or off site to control earth movement; and
            6. Requiring additional stabilization measures.
5. Energy.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. The City's Energy Code is intended to regulate the design of buildings for adequate thermal resistance and low air leakage. It requires the design and selection of mechanical, electrical, water, heating and illumination systems which will enable the efficient use of energy. Application of the Energy Code results in projects which achieve substantial energy savings.
        2. Industrial processes and manufacturing activities may have significant adverse energy impacts that are not addressed by the Seattle Energy Code.
        3. Energy conservation measures may conflict, in some cases, with the goal of preserving structures of historical significance.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to promote energy conservation and the most efficient possible use and production of energy.
        2. All major projects shall be required to analyze and disclose their energy impacts by fuel type and end-use.
        3. For projects with significant adverse energy impacts which involve activities not covered by the Energy Code, such as heavy industrial activities, or which meet one (1) or more of the conditions set forth in the Overview Policy, SMC Section 25.05.665 D, the decisionmaker may require that the environmental review include a reasonable assessment of alternatives and mitigating measures.
        4. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665, the decision-maker may condition or deny projects with significant adverse impacts relating to the use of the electrical energy in order to mitigate their adverse impacts to the City's electric utility system. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to conservation measures such as the use of alternative technologies.
        5. In applying these policies to the rehabilitation of structures with historical significance, the decisionmaker shall be flexible in the application of energy conservation measures which may be in conflict with historical preservation goals and shall attempt to achieve a balance in meeting these competing objectives.
6. Environmental Health.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. The use, discharge, disposal, emission or application of toxic or hazardous materials may pose hazards to human health and to plants, animals and ecological systems. Hazardous materials include such things as pesticides, herbicides, and electromagnetic transmissions.
        2. Federal, state and regional regulations are the primary means of mitigating risks associated with hazardous and toxic materials. However, such regulations cannot always be developed and implemented to anticipate or eliminate adverse impacts from hazardous materials and transmissions. Public knowledge regarding such hazardous materials and transmissions may develop more quickly than the regulations.
        3. To the extent that personal wireless and fixed wireless facilities comply with the Federal Communications Commission regulations concerning radiofrequency emissions, the City may not regulate placement, construction, and modification of such facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of such emissions, according to the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse impacts resulting from toxic or hazardous materials and transmissions, to the extent permitted by federal and state law.
        2. For all proposed projects involving the use, treatment, transport, storage, disposal, emission, or application of toxic or hazardous chemicals, materials, wastes or transmissions, the decisionmaker shall, in consultation with appropriate agencies with expertise, assess the extent of potential adverse impacts and the need for mitigation, where permitted by federal and state law.
        3. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665, if the decisionmaker makes a written finding that applicable federal, state and regional laws and regulations did not anticipate or do not adequately address the adverse impacts of a proposed project, the project may be conditioned or denied to mitigate its adverse impacts. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

            1. Use of an alternative technology;
            2. Reduction in the size or scope of a project or operation;
            3. Limits on the time and/or duration of operation; and
            4. Alternative routes of transportation.
7. Height, Bulk and Scale.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. The purpose of the City's adopted land use regulations is to provide for smooth transition between industrial, commercial, and residential areas, to preserve the character of individual city neighborhoods and to reinforce natural topography by controlling the height, bulk and scale of development.
        2. However, the City's land use regulations cannot anticipate or address all substantial adverse impacts resulting from incongruous height, bulk and scale. For example, unanticipated adverse impacts may occur when a project is located on a site with unusual topographic features or on a site which is substantially larger than the prevalent platting pattern in an area. Similarly, the mapping of the City's zoning designations cannot always provide a reasonable transition in height, bulk and scale between development in adjacent zones.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy that the height, bulk and scale of development projects should be reasonably compatible with the general character of development anticipated by the goals and policies set forth in Section B of the land use element of the Seattle Comprehensive Plan regarding Land Use Categories, the shoreline goals and policies set forth in Section D-4 of the land use element of the Seattle Comprehensive Plan, the procedures and locational criteria for shoreline environment redesignations set forth in SMC Sections 23.60.060 and 23.60.220, and the adopted land use regulations for the area in which they are located, and to provide for a reasonable transition between areas of less intensive zoning and more intensive zoning.
        2. Subject to the overview policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665, the decision-maker may condition or deny a project to mitigate the adverse impacts of substantially incompatible height, bulk and scale. Mitigating measures may include but are not limited to:

            1. Limiting the height of the development;
            2. Modifying the bulk of the development;
            3. Modifying the development's facade including but not limited to color and finish material;
            4. Reducing the number or size of accessory structures or relocating accessory structures including but not limited to towers, railings, and antennae;
            5. Repositioning the development on the site; and
            6. Modifying or requiring setbacks, screening, landscaping or other techniques to offset the appearance of incompatible height, bulk and scale.
        3. The Citywide design guidelines (and any Council-approved, neighborhood design guidelines) are intended to mitigate the same adverse height, bulk and scale impacts addressed in these policies. A project that is approved pursuant to the design review process is presumed to comply with these height, bulk and scale policies. This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that height, bulk and scale impacts documented through environmental review have not been adequately mitigated. Any additional mitigation imposed by the decisionmaker pursuant to these height, bulk and scale policies on projects that have undergone design review shall comply with design guidelines applicable to the project.
8. Historic Preservation.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. Historic buildings, special historic districts, and sites of archaeological significance are found within Seattle. The preservation of these buildings, districts and sites is important to the retention of a living sense and appreciation of the past.
        2. Historic sites, structures, districts and archaeological sites may be directly or indirectly threatened by development or redevelopment projects.
        3. Historic buildings are protected by the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance, as administered by the Landmarks Preservation Board. However, not all sites and structures meeting the criteria for historic landmark status have been designated yet.
        4. Special districts have been established to protect certain areas which are unique in their historical and cultural significance, including for example Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square and the International District. These areas are subject to development controls and project review by special district review boards.
        5. Archaeologically significant sites present a unique problem because protection of their integrity may, in some cases, eliminate any economic opportunity on the site.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to maintain and preserve significant historic sites and structures and to provide the opportunity for analysis of archaeological sites.
        2. For projects involving structures or sites which have been designated as historic landmarks, compliance with the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance shall constitute compliance with the policy set forth in subsection H2a above.
        3. For projects involving structures or sites which are not yet designated as historical landmarks but which appear to meet the criteria for designation, the decisionmaker or any interested person may refer the site or structure to the Landmarks Preservation Board for consideration. If the Board approves the site or structure for nomination as an historic landmark, consideration of the site or structure for designation as an historic landmark and application of controls and incentives shall proceed as provided by the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance. If the project is rejected for nomination, the project shall not be conditioned or denied for historical preservation purposes, except pursuant to paragraphs d or e of this subsection.
        4. When a project is proposed adjacent to or across the street from a designated site or structure, the decisionmaker shall refer the proposal to the City's Historic Preservation Officer for an assessment of any adverse impacts on the designated landmark and for comments on possible mitigating measures. Mitigation may be required to insure the compatibility of the proposed project with the color, material and architectural character of the designated landmark and to reduce impacts on the character of the landmark's site. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665, mitigating measures may be required and are limited to the following:

            1. Sympathetic facade treatment;
            2. Sympathetic street treatment;
            3. Sympathetic design treatment; and
            4. Reconfiguration of the project and/or relocation of the project on the project site;
9. Housing

    1. Demolition, rehabilitation, or conversion

        1. Policy background. Demolition or rehabilitation of low-rent housing units or conversion of housing for other uses can cause both displacement of low-income persons and reduction in the supply of housing.
        2. Policies

            1. It is the City's policy to encourage preservation of housing opportunities, especially for low-income persons, and to ensure that persons displaced by redevelopment are relocated.
            2. Proponents of projects shall disclose the on-site and off-site impacts of the proposed projects upon existing housing, with particular attention to low-income housing.
            3. Compliance with legally valid City ordinance provisions relating to housing relocation, demolition, and conversion shall constitute compliance with this housing policy.
            4. Housing preservation shall be an important consideration in the development of the City's public projects and programs. The City shall give high priority to limiting demolition of low-income housing in the development of its own facilities.
    2. Commercial development - Policy background

        1. The housing goal of the Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A RCW, encourages the availability of housing to all economic segments of the population. In accordance with the Growth Management Act, the housing element of the City's Comprehensive Plan shall, among other things, make adequate provision for existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community.
        2. SEPA provides that each person has a fundamental and inalienable right to a healthful environment. Affordable housing is a critical component of a healthful environment.
        3. Development of new commercial floor area is accompanied by employment growth, including lower-wage jobs. An increase in lower-wage jobs associated with new commercial floor area correlates with an increase in the need for affordable housing.
        4. The impact correlated with commercial development on the need for affordable housing falls disproportionately on persons of certain incomes and certain races and ethnicities. The City has a strong interest in mitigating the impacts of development of new commercial floor area in creating a need for affordable housing, particularly to ensure housing for those households earning no higher than 60 percent of median income.
        5. Because affordable housing is in short supply in the City and newly constructed housing is generally not affordable, lower-wage employees may be forced to live in less than adequate housing within the City, pay a disproportionate share of their incomes to live in adequate housing in the City, or commute ever increasing distances to their jobs from housing located outside the City when they are unable to locate adequate housing within the City.
        6. It is the City's policy that all people have the right to safe, healthy, and affordable housing.
    3. Commercial development - Policies

        1. The following policies apply to the development of a new structure, or an addition to an existing structure, that is not categorically exempt and contains more than 4,000 square feet of new chargeable floor area devoted to commercial uses as defined in Section 23.84A.006 in areas for which the provisions of the zone specifically refer to Chapter 23.58B:

            1. It is the City's policy to mitigate a portion of the affordable housing impacts of commercial development on low-income people, including people of color.
            2. In determining the necessary affordable housing impact mitigation, the decision maker shall consider the need for affordable housing created by the development due to employment growth, including lower-wage jobs, associated with the development.
            3. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to:

                1. Production of affordable housing units on-site or off-site; and
                2. Payment to fund affordable housing.
            4. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in Section 25.05.665, the decision maker may condition or deny a commercial development project described in this subsection 25.05.675.I.3.a to mitigate adverse impacts on the need for affordable housing. Compliance with Chapter 23.58B shall constitute compliance with the policies set forth in this subsection 25.05.675.I.3.a.
10. Land Use.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. The City has adopted land use regulations that are designed, in part, to minimize or prevent impacts resulting from incompatible land use. However, the adopted Land Use Code (Title 23) cannot identify or anticipate all possible uses and all potential land use impacts. For example, adverse cumulative land use impacts may result when a particular use or uses permitted under the Zoning Code occur in an area to such an extent that they foreclose opportunities for higher-priority, preferred uses called for in Section B of the land use element of the Comprehensive Plan and the shoreline goals and policies set forth in section D-4 of the land use element of the Comprehensive Plan.
        2. Density-related impacts of development are addressed under the policies set forth in subsections G (height, bulk and scale), M (parking), R (traffic) and O (public services and facilities) of this section and are not addressed under this policy.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to ensure that proposed uses in development projects are reasonably compatible with surrounding uses and are consistent with any applicable, adopted City land use regulations, the goals and policies set forth in Section B of the land use element of the Seattle Comprehensive Plan regarding Land Use Categories, and the shoreline goals and policies set forth in section D-4 of the land use element of the Seattle Comprehensive Plan for the area in which the project is located.
        2. Subject to the overview policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665, the decisionmaker may condition or deny any project to mitigate adverse land use impacts resulting from a proposed project or to achieve consistency with the applicable City land use regulations, the goals and policies set forth in Section B of the land use element of the Seattle Comprehensive Plan regarding Land Use Categories, the shoreline goals and policies set forth in Section D-4 of the land use element of the Seattle Comprehensive Plan, the procedures and locational criteria for shoreline environment redesignations set forth in SMC Sections 23.60.060 and 23.60.220, respectively, and the environmentally critical areas policies.
11. Light and Glare.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. Development projects sometimes include lighting and/or reflective surface materials which can adversely affect motorists, pedestrians, and the surrounding area. Such adverse impacts may be mitigated by alternative lighting techniques and surface materials.
        2. The City's Land Use Code specifically addresses the issue of light and glare control associated with commercial and industrial projects.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent hazards and other adverse impacts created by light and glare.
        2. If a proposed project may create adverse impacts due to light and glare, the decisionmaker shall assess the impacts and the need for mitigation.
        3. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665, the decisionmaker may condition or deny a proposed project to mitigate its adverse impacts due to light and glare.
        4. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

            1. Limiting the reflective qualities of surface materials that can be used in the development;
            2. Limiting the area and intensity of illumination;
            3. Limiting the location or angle of illumination;
            4. Limiting the hours of illumination; and
            5. Providing landscaping.
12. Noise.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. Noise may be injurious to the public health, safety and welfare. It may have adverse impacts on commerce; the use, value and enjoyment of property; sleep and repose; and the physiological and psychological well-being of those who live and work in Seattle.
        2. The Noise Control Ordinance effectively addresses most noise impacts. However, some noise impacts are not addressed by the Noise Control Ordinance, such as the continual or repetitive noise of a project's operation.
        3. The Land Use Code addresses noise generators and noise impacts associated with commercial and industrial uses. However, all noise impacts may not be anticipated and mitigated by the Land Use Code.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse noise impacts resulting from new development or uses.
        2. The decisionmaker may require, as part of the environmental review of a project, an assessment of noise impacts likely to result from the project.
        3. Based in part on such assessments, and in consultation with appropriate agencies with expertise, the decisionmaker shall assess the extent of adverse impacts and the need for mitigation.
        4. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665, the decisionmaker may condition or deny a proposal to mitigate its adverse noise impacts.
        5. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

            1. Use of an alternative technology;
            2. Reduction in the size or scope of a project or operation;
            3. Limits on the time and/or duration of operation; and
            4. Requiring buffering, landscaping, or other techniques to reduce noise impacts off-site.
13. Parking

    1. Policy background.

        1. Increased parking demand associated with development projects may adversely affect the availability of parking in an area.
        2. Parking regulations to mitigate most parking impacts and to accommodate most of the cumulative effects of future projects on parking are implemented through the City's Land Use Code. However, in some neighborhoods, due to inadequate off-street parking, streets are unable to absorb parking spillover. The City recognizes that the cost of providing additional parking may have an adverse effect on the affordability of housing.
    2. Policies

        1. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse parking impacts associated with development projects.
        2. Subject to the overview and cumulative effects policies set forth in Sections 25.05.665 and 25.05.670, the decision maker may condition a project to mitigate the effects of development in an area on parking; provided that:

            1. No SEPA authority is provided to mitigate the impact of development on parking availability in the Downtown and South Lake Union Urban Centers;
            2. No SEPA authority is provided for the decision maker to mitigate the impact of development on parking availability for residential uses located within:

                1. the Capitol Hill/First Hill Urban Center, the Uptown Urban Center, and the University District Urban Center, except the portion of the Ravenna Urban Village that is not within 1,320 feet of a street with frequent transit service, measured as the walking distance from the nearest transit stop to the lot line of the lot;
                2. the Station Area Overlay District; and
                3. portions of urban villages within 1,320 feet of a street with frequent transit service, measured as the walking distance from the nearest transit stop to the lot line of the lot;
            3. Outside of the areas listed in subsection 25.05.675.M.2.b, parking impact mitigation for multifamily development, except in the Alki area, as described in subsection 25.05.675.M.2.c, may be required only where on-street parking is at capacity, as defined by the Seattle Department of Transportation or where the development itself would cause on-street parking to reach capacity as so defined.
        3. For the Alki area, as identified on Map B for 23.54.015, a higher number of spaces per unit than is required by Section 23.54.015 may be required to mitigate the adverse parking impacts of specific multifamily projects. Projects that generate a greater need for parking and that are located in places where the street cannot absorb that need — for example, because of proximity to the Alki Beach Park — may be required to provide additional parking spaces to meet the building's actual need. In determining that need, the size of the development project, the size of the units and the number of bedrooms in the units shall be considered.
        4. If parking impact mitigation is authorized by this subsection 25.05.675.M, it may include but is not limited to:

            1. Transportation management programs;
            2. Parking management and allocation plans;
            3. Incentives for the use of alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles, such as transit pass subsidies, parking fees, and provision of bicycle parking space;
            4. Increased parking ratios; and
            5. Reduced development densities to the extent that it can be shown that reduced parking spillover is likely to result; provided, that parking impact mitigation for multifamily development may not include reduction in development density.
14. Plants and Animals.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. Many species of birds, mammals, fish, and other classes of animals and plants living in the urban environments are of aesthetic, educational, ecological and in some cases economic value.
        2. Local wildlife populations are threatened by habitat loss through destruction and fragmentation of living and breeding areas and travelways, and by the reduction of habitat diversity.
        3. Substantial protection of wildlife habitats and travel corridors within the City is provided by the Seattle Shoreline Master Program.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent the loss of wildlife habitat and other vegetation which have substantial aesthetic, educational, ecological, and/or economic value. A high priority shall be given to the preservation and protection of special habitat types. Special habitat types include, but are not limited to, wetlands and associated areas (such as upland nesting areas), and spawning, feeding, or nesting sites. A high priority shall also be given to meeting the needs of state and federal threatened, endangered, and sensitive species of both plants and animals.
        2. For projects which are proposed within an identified plant or wildlife habitat or travelway, the decisionmaker shall assess the extent of adverse impacts and the need for mitigation.
        3. When the decisionmaker finds that a proposed project would reduce or damage rare, uncommon, unique or exceptional plant or wildlife habitat, wildlife travelways, or habitat diversity for species (plants or animals) of substantial aesthetic, educational, ecological or economic value, the decisionmaker may condition or deny the project to mitigate its adverse impacts. Such conditioning or denial is permitted whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665.
        4. Mitigating measures may include but are not limited to:

            1. Relocation of the project on the site;
            2. Reducing the size or scale of the project;
            3. Preservation of specific on-site habitats, such as trees or vegetated areas;
            4. Limitations on the uses allowed on the site;
            5. Limitations on times of operation during periods significant to the affected species (i.e., spawning season, mating season, etc.); and
            6. Landscaping and/or retention of existing vegetation.
15. Public Services and Facilities.

    1. Policy Background. A single development, though otherwise consistent with zoning regulations, may create excessive demands upon existing public services and facilities. "Public services and facilities" in this context includes facilities such as sewers, storm drains, solid waste disposal facilities, parks, schools, and streets and services such as transit, solid waste collection, public health services, and police and fire protection, provided by either a public agency or private entity.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse impacts to existing public services and facilities.
        2. The decisionmaker may require, as part of the environmental review of a project, a reasonable assessment of the present and planned condition and capacity of public services and facilities to serve the area affected by the proposal.
        3. Based upon such analyses, a project which would result in adverse impacts on existing public services and facilities may be conditioned or denied to lessen its demand for services and facilities, or required to improve or add services and/or facilities for the public, whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665.
16. Public View Protection.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. Seattle has a magnificent natural setting of greenery, mountains, and water; visual amenities and opportunities are an integral part of the City's environmental quality.
        2. The City has developed particular sites for the public's enjoyment of views of mountains, water and skyline and has many scenic routes and other public places where such views enhance one's experience.
        3. Obstruction of public views may occur when a proposed structure is located in close proximity to the street property line, when development occurs on lots situated at the foot of a street that terminates or changes direction because of a shift in the street grid pattern, or when development along a street creates a continuous wall separating the street from the view.
        4. Authority provided through the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance is intended to preserve sites and structures which reflect significant elements of the City's historic heritage and to designate and regulate such sites and structures as historic landmarks.
        5. The Land Use Code provides for the preservation of specified view corridors through setback requirements.
        6. Adopted Land Use Codes attempt to protect private views through height and bulk controls and other zoning regulations but it is impractical to protect private views through project-specific review.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to protect public views of significant natural and human-made features: Mount Rainer, the Olympic and Cascade Mountains, the downtown skyline, and major bodies of water including Puget Sound, Lake Washington, Lake Union and the Ship Canal, from public places consisting of the specified viewpoints, parks, scenic routes, and view corridors, identified in Attachment 1. (Attachment 1 is located at the end of this Section 25.05.675.) This subsection does not apply to the Space Needle, which is governed by subsection P2c of this section.

            1. The decisionmaker may condition or deny a proposal to eliminate or reduce its adverse impacts on designated public views, whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665; provided that downtown projects may be conditioned or denied only when public views from outside of downtown would be blocked as a result of a change in the street grid pattern.
        2. It is the City's policy to protect public views of historic landmarks designated by the Landmarks Preservation Board which, because of their prominence of location or contrasts of siting, age, or scale, are easily identifiable visual features of their neighborhood or the City and contribute to the distinctive quality or identity of their neighborhood or the City. This subsection does not apply to the Space Needle, which is governed by subsection P2c of this section.

            1. A proposed project may be conditioned or denied to mitigate view impacts on historic landmarks, whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665.
        3. It is the City's policy to protect public views of the Space Needle from the following public places. A proposed project may be conditioned or denied to protect such views, whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665.

            1. Alki Beach Park (Duwamish Head)
            2. Bhy Kracke Park
            3. Gasworks Park
            4. Hamilton View Point
            5. Kerry Park
            6. Myrtle Edwards Park
            7. Olympic Sculpture Park
            8. Seacrest Park
            9. Seattle Center
            10. Volunteer Park
        4. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

            1. Requiring a change in the height of the development;
            2. Requiring a change in the bulk of the development;
            3. Requiring a redesign of the profile of the development;
            4. Requiring on-site view corridors or requiring enhancements to off-site view corridors;
            5. Relocating the project on the site;
            6. Requiring a reduction or rearrangement of walls, fences or plant material; and
            7. Requiring a reduction or rearrangement of accessory structures including, but not limited to towers, railings and antennae.
17. Shadows on Open Spaces.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. Access to sunlight, especially in Seattle's climate, is an amenity of public open spaces.
        2. It is possible to design and locate structures to minimize the extent to which they block light from public open spaces.
        3. The Downtown Land Use Code provides some protections against shadow impacts created by development in downtown. However, due to the scale of development permitted in downtown, it is not practical to prevent such blockage at all public open spaces downtown.
        4. The City's Land Use Code (Title 23) attempts to protect private property from undue shadow impacts through height, bulk and setback controls, but it is impractical to protect private properties from shadows through project-specific review.
    2. Policies. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent light blockage and the creation of shadows on open spaces most used by the public.

        1. Areas outside of downtown to be protected are as follows:

            1. Publicly owned parks;
            2. Public schoolyards;
            3. Private schools which allow public use of schoolyards during non-school hours; and
            4. Publicly owned street ends in shoreline areas.
        2. Areas in downtown where shadow impacts may be mitigated are:

            1. Freeway Park;
            2. Westlake Park and Plaza;
            3. Market (Steinbrueck) Park;
            4. Convention Center Park; and
            5. Kobe Terrace Park and the publicly owned portions of the International District Community Garden.
        3. The decisionmaker shall assess the extent of adverse impacts and the need for mitigation. The analysis of sunlight blockage and shadow impacts shall include an assessment of the extent of shadows, including times of the year, hours of the day, anticipated seasonal use of open spaces, availability of other open spaces in the area, and the number of people affected.
        4. When the decisionmaker finds that a proposed project would substantially block sunlight from open spaces listed in subsections Q2a and Q2b above at a time when the public most frequently uses that space, the decisionmaker may condition or deny the project to mitigate the adverse impacts of sunlight blockage, whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665.
        5. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

            1. Limiting the height of the development;
            2. Limiting the bulk of the development;
            3. Redesigning the profile of the development;
            4. Limiting or rearranging walls, fences, or plant material;
            5. Limiting or rearranging accessory structures, i.e., towers, railing, antennae; and
            6. Relocating the project on the site.
18. Traffic and Transportation.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. Excessive traffic can adversely affect the stability, safety and character of Seattle's communities.
        2. Substantial traffic volumes associated with major projects may adversely impact surrounding areas.
        3. Individual projects may create adverse impacts on transportation facilities which service such projects. Such impacts may result in a need for turn channelization, right-of-way dedication, street widening or other improvements including traffic signalization.
        4. Seattle's land use policies call for decreasing reliance on the single occupant automobile and increased use of alternative transportation modes.
        5. Regional traffic and transportation impacts arising as a result of downtown development have been addressed in substantial part by the Land Use Code.
        6. The University District is an area of the City which is subject to particularly severe traffic congestion problems, as highlighted in the 1983 City-University Agreement, and therefore deserves special attention in the environmental review of project proposals.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse traffic impacts which would undermine the stability, safety and/or character of a neighborhood or surrounding areas.
        2. In determining the necessary traffic and transportation impact mitigation, the decisionmaker shall examine the expected peak traffic and circulation pattern of the proposed project weighed against such factors as the availability of public transit; existing vehicular and pedestrian traffic conditions; accident history; the trend in local area development; parking characteristics of the immediate area; the use of the street as determined by the Seattle Department of Transportation's Seattle Comprehensive Transportation Plan; and the availability of goods, services and recreation within reasonable walking distance.
        3. Mitigation of traffic and transportation impacts shall be permitted whether or not the project meets the criteria of the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665.
        4. Mitigation measures which may be applied to residential projects in downtown are limited to the following:

            1. Signage;
            2. Provision of information on transit and ride-sharing programs; and
            3. Bicycle parking.
        5. Mitigating measures which may be applied to nonresidential projects in downtown are limited to the following:

            1. Provision of transit incentives including transit pass subsidies;
            2. Signage;
            3. Improvements to pedestrian and vehicular traffic operations, signalization, turn channelization, right-of-way dedication, street widening, or other improvements proportionate to the impact of the project; and
            4. Transportation management plans.
        6. Mitigating measures which may be applied to projects outside of downtown may include, but are not limited to:

            1. Changes in access;
            2. Changes in the location, number and size of curb cuts and driveways;
            3. Provision of transit incentives including transit pass subsidies;
            4. Bicycle parking;
            5. Signage;
            6. Improvements to pedestrian and vehicular traffic operations including signalization, turn channelization, right-of-way dedication, street widening, or other improvements proportionate to the impacts of the project; and
            7. Transportation management plans.
            8. For projects outside downtown which result in adverse impacts, the decisionmaker may reduce the size and/or scale of the project only if the decisionmaker determines that the traffic improvements outlined under subparagraph R2fi above would not be adequate to effectively mitigate the adverse impacts of the project.
19. Water Quality.

    1. Policy Background.

        1. Seattle's water quality is adversely affected primarily by the dumping of pollutants and drainage-related sewage overflows into Puget Sound, Lake Union, the Lake Washington Ship Canal, the Duwamish Waterway and all lakes, riparian corridors, wetlands, and other systems draining into these bodies of water.
        2. Seattle's water quality is also adversely affected by storm drainage runoff; nonpoint-source discharges from streets, parking lots and other impervious surfaces; construction site runoff; and sewage and graywater discharge from recreational and commercial watercraft.
        3. Federal, state, local and regional water quality regulations and programs cannot always anticipate or eliminate adverse impacts to water quality.
    2. Policies.

        1. It is the City's policy to minimize or prevent adverse water quality impacts.
        2. For any project proposal which poses a potential threat to water quality in Seattle, the decisionmaker shall assess the probable effect of the impact and the need for mitigating measures. The assessment shall be completed in consultation with appropriate agencies with expertise.
        3. Subject to the Overview Policy set forth in SMC Section 25.05.665, if the decision-maker makes a written finding that the applicable federal, state and regional regulations did not anticipate or are inadequate to address the particular impact(s) of a project, the decisionmaker may condition or deny the project to mitigate its adverse impacts.
        4. Mitigating measures may include, but are not limited to:

            1. Use of an alternative technology;
            2. Reduction in the size or scope of the project or operation;
            3. Landscaping; and
            4. Limits on the time and duration of the project or operation.

#### 25.05.680 - Appeals

Appeal provisions in SEPA are found in RCW 43.21C.060, 43.21C.075, 43.21C.080, 43.21C.420, and WAC 197-11-680. The following provisions attempt to construe and interpret the statutory and administrative rule provisions. In the event a court determines that code provisions are inconsistent with statutory provisions or administrative rule, or with the framework and policy of SEPA, the statute or rule will control. Persons considering either administrative or judicial appeal of any decision that involves SEPA are advised to read the statutory and rule sections cited above.


1. Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions

    1. For proposals requiring a Master Use Permit under Chapter 23.76, Procedures for Master Use Permits and Council Land Use Decisions, for which the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections or a non-City agency is the lead agency, SEPA appeal procedures shall be as provided in Chapter 23.76.
    2. For proposals requiring Master Use Permits or Council Land Use Decisions for which a City department other than the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections is lead agency and is a project proponent or is funding a project and where the City department chooses to conduct SEPA review prior to submitting an application for the Master Use Permit or Council Land Use Decision:

        1. The following agency environmental determinations shall be subject to appeal to the Hearing Examiner by any interested person as provided in this subsection:

            1. Determination of Nonsignificance (DNS);
            2. Adequacy of the Final EIS as filed in the SEPA Public Information Center.
        2. An appeal shall be commenced by filing of a notice of appeal with the Office of the Hearing Examiner no later than 5 p.m. the fourteenth day following the filing of the decision in the SEPA Public Information Center or publication of the decision in the City official newspaper, whichever is later; provided that when a 14 day DNS comment period is required pursuant to this Chapter 25.05, appeals may be filed no later than the twenty-first day following such filing or publication. The appeal notice shall set forth in a clear and concise manner the alleged errors in the decision. Upon timely notice of appeal the Hearing Examiner shall set a date for hearing and send notice to the parties. Filing fees for appeals to the Hearing Examiner are established in Section 3.02.125.
2. Decisions Not Related to Master Use Permits or Council Land Use Decisions

    1. The following agency decisions on proposals not requiring a Master Use Permit shall be subject to appeal to the Hearing Examiner by any interested person as provided in this subsection:

        1. Determination of Nonsignificance.
        2. Adequacy of the final EIS as filed in the SEPA Public Information Center. Notice of all decisions described in this subsection shall be filed promptly by the responsible official in the City's SEPA Public Information Center.
    2. An appeal shall be commenced by the filing of a notice of appeal with the office of the Hearing Examiner no later than the fifteenth day following the filing of the decision in the SEPA Public Information Center or publication of the decision in the City official newspaper, whichever is later; provided that when a 14 day DNS comment period is required pursuant to this Chapter 25.05, appeals may be filed no later than the twenty-first day following such filing or publication. The appeal notice shall set forth in a clear and concise manner the alleged errors in the decision. Upon timely notice of appeal the Hearing Examiner shall set a date for hearing and send notice to the parties. Filing fees for appeals to the Hearing Examiner are established in Section 3.02.125.
    3. Appeals shall be considered de novo and limited to the issues cited in the notice of appeal. The determination appealed from shall be accorded substantial weight and the burden of establishing the contrary shall be upon the appealing party. The Hearing Examiner shall have authority to affirm or reverse the administrative decisions below, to remand cases to the appropriate department with directions for further proceedings, and to grant other appropriate relief in the circumstances. Within 15 days after the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall file and transmit to the parties written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a decision.
    4. The Hearing Examiner is authorized to promulgate rules and procedures to implement the provisions of this Section 25.05. The rules shall be promulgated pursuant to Chapter 3.02.
    5. If the agency has made a decision on a proposed action, the Hearing Examiner shall consolidate any allowed appeals of procedural and substantive determinations under SEPA with any hearing or appeal on the underlying City action. For example, an appeal of the adequacy of an EIS must be consolidated with a hearing or appeal on the agency's decision or recommendation on the proposed action, if both proceedings are allowed by ordinance.
3. Judicial Appeals

    1. SEPA authorizes judicial appeals of both procedural and substantive compliance with SEPA.
    2. When SEPA applies to a decision, any judicial appeal of that decision potentially involves both those issues pertaining to SEPA (SEPA issues) and those which do not (non-SEPA issues). If there is a time limit established by statute or ordinance for appealing the underlying governmental action, then appeals (or portions thereof) raising SEPA issues must be filed within such time period. If there is no time period for appealing the underlying governmental action, and a notice of action under RCW 43.21C.080 is used, appeals must be commenced within the time period specified by RCW 43.21C.080.
    3. If the proposal requires more than one governmental decision that will be supported by the same SEPA documents, then RCW 43.21C.080 still only allows one judicial appeal of procedural compliance with SEPA, which must be commenced within the applicable time to appeal the first governmental decision.
    4. If there is no time limit established by statute or ordinance for appeal, and the notice of action provisions are not used, then SEPA provides no time limit for judicial appeals. Appeal times may still be limited, however, by general statutes of limitation or the common law.
    5. For the purposes of this subsection, "a time limit established by statute or ordinance" does not include time limits established by the general statutes of limitation in chapter 4.16 RCW.
4. RCW 43.21C.420 bars certain SEPA appeals if the City has elected to adopt optional elements of the City's Comprehensive Plan or development regulations pursuant to RCW 43.21C.420. Unless an ordinance enacting or amending the Comprehensive Plan or development regulations expressly recites that it is being adopted pursuant to the authority of RCW 43.21C.420, RCW 43.21C.420 does not affect the availability of appeals. If RCW 43.21C.420 applies to a non-project EIS as described in RCW 43.21C.420, then unless the City Council by ordinance establishes a different time frame for submitting a complete application for purposes of RCW 43.21C.420 (5) with respect to that EIS, the time frame is 24 hours following the date of issuance of the final EIS.
5. Official Notice of the Date and Place for Commencing a Judicial Appeal

    1. Official notice of the date and place for commencing an appeal must be given if there is a time limit established by statute or ordinance for commencing an appeal of the underlying governmental action. The notice shall include the time limit for commencing an appeal, the statute or ordinance establishing the time limit and where an appeal may be filed.
    2. Notice is given by:

        1. Delivery of written notice to the applicant, all parties to any administrative appeal, and all persons who have requested notice of decisions with respect to the particular proposal in question; and
        2. Following the agency's normal methods of notice for the type of governmental action taken.
    3. Written notice containing the information required by subsection 25.05.680.E.1 may be appended to the permit, decision documents, or SEPA compliance documents or may be printed separately.
    4. Official notices required by this subparagraph shall not be given prior to final agency action.

A license includes all or part of any agency permit, certificate, approval, registration, charter, or plat approvals or rezones to facilitate a particular proposal. The term does not include a license required solely for revenue purposes.


#### 25.05.762 - Local agency.

"Local agency" or "local government" means any political subdivision, regional governmental unit, district, municipal or public corporation, including cities, towns, and counties and their legislative bodies. The term encompasses but does not refer specifically to the departments within a city or county.


#### 25.05.764 - Major action.

"Major action" means an action that is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts. "Major" reinforces but does not have a meaning independent of "significantly" (Section 25.05.794).


#### 25.05.766 - Mitigated DNS.

"Mitigated DNS" means a DNS that includes mitigation measures and is issued as a result of the process specified in Section 25.05.350.


#### 25.05.768 - Mitigation.

"Mitigation" means:


1. Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;
2. Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;
3. Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;
4. Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;
5. Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; and/or
6. Monitoring the impact and taking appropriate corrective measures.

#### 25.05.770 - Natural environment.

"Natural environment" means those aspects of the environment contained in Section 25.05.444 A, frequently referred to as natural elements, or resources, such as earth, air, water, wildlife, and energy.


#### 25.05.772 - NEPA.

"NEPA" means the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 USCA 4321 et seq., P.L. 91-190), that is like SEPA at the federal level. The federal NEPA regulations are located at 40 CFR 1500 et seq.


#### 25.05.774 - Nonproject.

"Nonproject" means actions which are different or broader than a single site specific project, such as plans, policies, and programs (Section 25.05.704).


#### 25.05.775 - Open record hearing.

"Open record hearing" means a hearing held under Chapter 36.70B RCW and conducted by a single hearing body or officer authorized by the County/City to conduct such hearings, that creates the County's/City's record through testimony and submission of evidence and information, under procedures prescribed by the County/City by ordinance. An open record hearing may be held prior to a County's/City's decision on a project permit to be known as an "open record predecision hearing." An open record hearing may be held on an appeal, to be known as an "open record appeal hearing," if no open record predecision hearing has been held on the project permit. (RCW 36.70B.020(3).)


#### 25.05.776 - Phased review.

"Phased review" means the coverage of general matters in broader environmental documents, with subsequent narrower documents concentrating solely on the issues specific to the later analysis (Section 25.05.060 E). Phased review may be used for a single proposal or EIS (Section 25.05.060).


#### 25.05.778 - Preparation.

"Preparation" of an environmental document means preparing or supervising the preparation of documents, including issuing, filing, printing, circulating, and related requirements (see Section 25.05.700 B).


#### 25.05.780 - Private project.

"Private project" means any proposal primarily initiated or sponsored by an individual or entity other than an agency.


#### 25.05.782 - Probable.

"Probable" means likely or reasonably likely to occur, as in "a reasonable probability of more than a moderate effect on the quality of the environment" (see Section 25.05.794 (Significant)). "Probable" is used to distinguish likely impacts from those that merely have a possibility of occurring, but are remote or speculative. This is not meant as a strict statistical probability test.


#### 25.05.784 - Proposal.

"Proposal" means a proposed action. A proposal includes both actions and regulatory decisions of agencies as well as any actions proposed by applicants. A proposal exists at that state in the development of an action when an agency is presented with an application, or has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal, and the environmental effects can be meaningfully evaluated. (See Section 25.05.055 and Section 25.05.060 C. A proposal may therefore be a particular or preferred course of action or several alternatives. For this reason, these rules use the phrase "alternatives including the proposed action." The term "proposal" may therefore include "other reasonable courses of action," if there is no preferred alternative and if it is appropriate to do so in the particular context.


#### 25.05.786 - Reasonable alternative.

"Reasonable alternative" means an action that could feasibly attain or approximate a proposal's objectives, but at a lower environmental cost or decreased level of environmental degradation. Reasonable alternatives may be those over which an agency with jurisdiction has authority to control impacts, either directly, or indirectly through requirement of mitigation measures. (See Sections 25.05.440 D and 25.05.660.) Also see the definition of "scope" for three (3) types of alternatives to be analyzed in EIS's (Section 25.05.792).


#### 25.05.788 - Responsible official.

"Responsible official" means that officer or officers, committee, department, or section of the lead agency is designated by agency SEPA procedures to undertake its procedural responsibilities as lead agency (Section 25.05.910).


#### 25.05.790 - SEPA.

"SEPA" means the State Environmental Policy Act (Chapter 43.21C RCW), which is also referred to as the Act. The "SEPA process" means all measures necessary for compliance with the Act's requirements.


#### 25.05.792 - Scope.

1. "Scope" means the range of proposed actions, alternatives, and impacts to be analyzed in an environmental document (Section 25.05.060 B (content of environmental review)).
2. To determine the scope of environmental impact statements, agencies consider three (3) types of actions, three (3) types of impacts, and three (3) types of alternatives.

    1. Actions may be:

        1. Single (a specific action which is not related to other proposals or parts of proposals);
        2. Connected (proposals or parts of proposals which are closely related under Section 25.05.060 C or Section 25.05.305 A; or
        3. Similar (proposals that have common aspects and may be analyzed together under Section 25.05.060 C).
    2. Alternatives may be:

        1. No action;
        2. Other reasonable courses of action; or
        3. Mitigation measures (not in the proposed action).
    3. Impacts may be:

        1. Direct;
        2. Indirect; or
        3. Cumulative.
3. Section 25.05.060 provides general rules for the content of any environmental review under SEPA; Subchapter IV and Section 25.05.440 provide specific rules for the content of EIS's. The scope of an individual statement may depend on its relationship with other EIS's or on phased review.

#### 25.05.793 - Scoping.

"Scoping" means determining the range of proposed actions, alternatives, and impacts to be discussed in an EIS. Because an EIS is required to analyze significant environmental impacts only, scoping is intended to identify and narrow the EIS to the significant issues. The required scoping process (Section 25.05.408) provides interagency and public notice of a DS, or equivalent notification, and opportunity to comment. The lead agency has the option of expanding the scoping process (Section 25.05.410), but shall not be required to do so. Scoping is used to encourage cooperation and early resolution of potential conflicts, to improve decisions, and to reduce paperwork and delay.


#### 25.05.794 - Significant.

1. "Significant," as used in SEPA, means a reasonable likelihood of more than a moderate adverse impact on environmental quality.
2. Significance involves context and intensity (Section 25.05.330 (threshold determination process)) and does not limit itself to a formula or quantifiable test. The context may vary with the physical setting. Intensity depends on the magnitude and duration of an impact.

The severity of an impact should be weighed along with the likelihood of its occurrence. An impact may be significant if its chance of occurrence is not great, but the resulting environmental impact would be severe if it occurred.

3. Section 25.05.330 specifies a process, including criteria and procedures, for determining whether a proposal is likely to have a significant adverse environmental impact.

#### 25.05.796 - State agency.

"State agency" means any state board, commission, department, or officer, including state universities, colleges, and community colleges, that is authorized by law to make rules, hear contested cases, or otherwise take the actions stated in Section 25.05.704, except the judiciary and state legislature.


#### 25.05.797 - Threshold determination.

"Threshold determination" means the decision by the responsible official of the lead agency whether or not an EIS is required for a proposal that is not categorically exempt (Sections 25.05.310 and 25.05.330 A2).


#### 25.05.799 - Underlying governmental action.

"Underlying government action" means the governmental action, such as zoning, or permit approvals, that is the subject of SEPA compliance.



### Subchapter IX - Categorical Exemptions
#### 25.05.800 - Categorical exemptions

The proposed actions contained in this Section 25.05.800 are categorically exempt from threshold determination and EIS requirements, subject to the rules and limitations on categorical exemptions contained in Section 25.05.305.

To be exempt under this Section 25.05.800, the project shall be equal to or smaller than the exempt level. For a specific proposal, the exempt level in subsection 25.05.800.A.2 shall control. If the proposal is located in more than one city or county, the lower of the agencies' adopted levels shall control, regardless of which agency is the lead agency. The exemptions in this subsection 25.05.800.A apply except when the project:

        1. Is undertaken wholly or partly on lands covered by water;
        2. Requires a license governing discharges to water that is not exempt under RCW 43.21C.0383;
        3. Requires a license governing emissions to air that is not exempt under RCW 43.21C.0381 or WAC 197-11-800 (7) or 197-11-800 (8); or
        4. Requires a land use decision that is not exempt under subsection 25.05.800.F.
    2. The following types of construction are exempt, except when undertaken wholly or partly on lands covered by water or unless undertaken in environmentally critical areas listed in subsection 25.05.908.A:

        1. The construction or location of residential or mixed-use development containing no more than the number of dwelling units identified in Table A for 25.05.800;
        2. The construction of a barn, loafing shed, farm equipment storage building, produce storage or packing structure, or similar agricultural structure, covering 10,000 square feet or less, and to be used only by the property owner or his or her agent in the conduct of farming the property. This exemption does not apply to feed lots;
        3. The construction of office, school, commercial, recreational, service, or storage buildings, containing no more than the gross floor area listed in Table B for 25.05.800 below:

        5. Any fill or excavation of 500 cubic yards or less throughout the total lifetime of the fill or excavation; and any excavation, fill or grading necessary for an exempt project in subsections 25.05.800.A.2.a, 25.05.800.A.2.b, 25.05.800.A.2.c, or 25.05.800.A.2.d shall be exempt.
        6. Mixed-use construction, including but not limited to projects combining residential and commercial uses, is exempt if each use, if considered separately, is exempt under the criteria of subsections 25.05.800.A.2.a through 25.05.800.A.2.d, unless the uses in combination may have a probable significant adverse environmental impact in the judgment of an agency with jurisdiction (see subsection 25.05.305.A.2.b);
        7. In zones not specifically identified in this subsection 25.05.800.A, the standards for the most similar zone addressed by this subsection 25.05.800.A apply;
        8. For the purposes of this subsection 25.05.800.A, "mixed-use development" means development having two or more principal uses, one of which is a residential use comprising 50 percent or more of the gross floor area;
        9. To implement the requirements of Table A for 25.05.800 and Table B for 25.05.800, the Director shall establish exemption limits by rule for each urban center and each urban village containing a SAOD to assure that proposed development that could cause growth targets in Appendix A of the Comprehensive Plan's Urban Village Element to be exceeded is subject to SEPA review. The exemption limits shall contain a "cushion" to assure that development does not exceed growth targets without SEPA review, provided that the cushion shall be at least 10 percent of the residential or employment growth targets established in the Comprehensive Plan; and
        10. The Director shall monitor residential and employment growth and publish quarterly a determination of growth for each urban center and urban village containing a SAOD. Residential growth shall include, but need not be limited to, net new units that have been built and net new units in projects that have received a building permit but have not received a certificate of occupancy. If the Director determines that exemption limits have been reached for an urban center or urban village containing a SAOD, subsequent development is not categorically exempt from SEPA review pursuant to RCW 43.21C.229.
2. Other minor new construction

    1. The exemptions in this subsection 25.05.800.B apply to all licenses required to undertake the following types of proposals except when the project:

A copy of the maps shall be maintained in the SEPA Public Information Center.
5. Proposals that will be located within environmentally critical areas are to be treated no differently than other proposals under this chapter, except as stated in the prior subsection. A threshold determination shall be made for all such actions, and an EIS shall not be automatically required for a proposal merely because it is proposed for location in an environmentally critical area.

#### 25.05.910 - Designation of responsible department and responsible official where City is lead agency.

(See WAC 197-11-910).


1. For each proposal where the City is the lead agency, the responsible department shall be designated prior to designation of the responsible official.

    5. When the proposal will involve both private and public construction activity, it shall be characterized as either a private or a public project for the purposes of responsible department designation, depending upon whether the primary sponsor or initiator of the project is a department or from the private sector. Any project in which department and private interests are too intertwined to make this characterization shall be considered a public project.
    6. For proposals for private projects which require licenses from more than one (1) department, the responsible department shall be the department with responsibility for making the final recommendation or report on the first major action of the proposal or the first action which would result in irreversible commitment to the proposal; or in the event these conditions do not apply, the responsible department shall be the department whose action, license, or licenses will have the greatest effect on the environment;
    7. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a department from assuming the role of responsible department as the result of an agreement among all departments with jurisdiction;
    8. In the event that the departments with jurisdiction are unable to determine which department is the responsible department under this subchapter, any department with jurisdiction may petition the Mayor for such determination. The petition shall clearly describe the proposal in question and include a list of all licenses and approvals required for the proposal. The petition shall be filed with the Mayor within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the petitioning department of the determination to which it objects. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of a petition, the Mayor shall designate the responsible department.

The ultimate charge to the applicant shall not exceed the estimate. A consultant or consultants shall be selected by the responsible official in consultation with the private applicant.
3. All fees owed the City under this section shall be paid in full by the private applicant prior to final action by the City on the private project. Any fee owed the City under subsection A1 shall be paid by the private applicant prior to the initiation of actual preparation of an EIS (if required) or actual rewriting of an applicant-prepared EIS by the City of its consultant(s). If the private applicant disputes the amount of fee charged, the fee may be paid under protest and without prejudice to the applicant's right to file a claim and bring an action to recover the fee.

The first agency receiving an application for or initiating a nonexempt proposal shall determine the lead agency for that proposal, unless the lead agency has been previously determined, or the agency receiving the proposal is aware that another agency is determining the lead agency. The lead agency shall be determined by using the criteria in Sections 25.05.926 through 25.05.944.
2. If an agency determines that another agency is the lead agency, it shall mail to such lead agency a copy of the application it received, together with its determination of lead agency and an explanation. If the agency receiving this determination agrees that it is the lead agency, it shall notify the other agencies with jurisdiction. If it does not agree, and the dispute cannot be resolved by agreement, the agencies shall immediately petition the Department of Ecology (DOE) for a lead agency determination under Section 25.05.946.
3. Any agency receiving a lead agency determination to which it objects shall either resolve the dispute, withdraw its objection, or petition DOE for a lead agency determination within fifteen (15) days of receiving the determination. Any such petition on behalf of the City shall be initiated by the Mayor or the Mayor's designee.
4. An applicant may also petition DOE to resolve the lead agency dispute under Section 25.05.946.
5. To make the lead agency determination, an agency must determine to the best of its ability the range of proposed actions for the proposal (Section 25.05.060) and the other agencies with jurisdiction over some or all of the proposal. This can be done by:

    1. Describing or requiring an applicant to describe the main features of the proposal;
    2. Reviewing the list of agencies with expertise;
    3. Contacting potential agencies with jurisdiction either orally or in writing.

#### 25.05.926 - Lead agency for governmental proposals.

If two (2) or more agencies share in the implementation of a proposal, the agencies shall by agreement determine which agency will be the lead agency. For the purposes of this section, a proposal by an agency does not include proposals to license private activity.
2. Whenever possible, agency people carrying out SEPA procedures should be different from agency people making the proposal.

#### 25.05.928 - Lead agency for public and private proposals.

When the proposal involves both private and public activities, it shall be characterized as either a private or a public project for the purposes of lead agency designation, depending upon whether the primary sponsor or initiator of the project is an agency or from the private sector. Any project in which agency and private interests are too intertwined to make this characterization shall be considered a public project. The lead agency for all public projects shall be determined under Section 25.05.926.

Sections:

### 25.06.010 - Title.

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Seattle Floodplain Development Ordinance."


### 25.06.020 - Purpose

The purpose of this Chapter 25.06 is to regulate development in areas of special flood hazard in accordance with standards established by the National Flood Insurance Program and the Washington State Department of Ecology and areas identified as flood-prone in subsection 25.09.020.B. This Chapter 25.06 is intended to promote the public health, safety and welfare and is not intended to protect or benefit any individual or any class or group of persons specifically, or to create or form the basis for any liability on the part of the City or its officers, employees or agents in connection with administration of this Chapter 25.06. This Chapter 25.06 shall be administered by affected City departments and interpreted to accomplish its stated purpose.


### 25.06.030 - Definitions

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Chapter 25.06 shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage. For purposes of this Chapter 25.06, the following words or phrases are defined as set out below:


1. "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one (1) to three (3) feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and, velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.
2. "Area of special flood hazard" means the land subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for areas of special flood hazard always includes the letters A or V.
3. "Base flood level" and "base flood elevation" both mean the level or elevation above mean sea level, as calculated by reference to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), of floodwaters in a particular area during flood having a one (1) percent chance of occurring in any given year.
4. "Critical facility" means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, nonresidential installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
5. "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage equipment or materials.
6. "Director" means the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections. As used in this Chapter 25.06, the term includes authorized representatives of the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections.
7. "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

    1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
    2. The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
8. "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the Flood Insurance Study for King County, Washington and incorporated areas, dated May 16, 1995, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps, that has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to The City of Seattle, or as otherwise required by the Department of Homeland Security.
9. "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report, entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for King County, Washington and Incorporated Areas," dated May 16, 1995, provided by the Federal Insurance Administration, that includes flood profiles, the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
10. "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1').
11. "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of applicable nonelevation design requirements of subsection A2 of Section 25.06.110.
12. "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" also includes travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days.
13. "Manufactured home park" or "manufactured home subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
14. "New construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is (a) built on a single chassis; (b) four hundred (400) square feet or less in area when measured at the largest horizontal projection; (c) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and (d) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
16. "Start of construction" means and includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The "actual start" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. "Permanent construction" does not include site preparation, such as a clearing, grading or filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
17. "Structure" means anything that is built or constructed, an edifice or building of any kind, or any piece of work artificially built up or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner.

#### 25.08.615 - Revocation of Variance

1. Standards for revocation. Any noise variance may be revoked if:

    1. The noise code or the conditions of the variance have been, or are being violated and issuance of a notice of violation or stop work order has been, or would be ineffective to secure compliance because of circumstances related to the violation; or
    2. The variance was obtained with false or misleading information.
2. Notice of Revocation. Whenever the Administrator determines there are grounds for revoking a variance, the Administrator may issue a Notice of Revocation.

An economic variance shall contain a timetable for the taking of action in an expeditious manner and shall be conditioned on adherence to the timetable.


#### 25.08.655 - Major public project construction variance

1. The Administrator may grant a major public project construction variance to provide relief from the exterior sound level limits established by this Chapter 25.08 during the construction periods of major public projects. A major public project construction variance shall provide relief from the exterior sound level limits during the construction or reconstruction of a major public project only to the extent the applicant demonstrates that compliance with the levels would:

    1. Be unreasonable in light of public or worker safety or cause the applicant to violate other applicable regulations, including but not limited to regulations that reduce impacts on transportation infrastructure or natural resources; or
    2. Render the project economically or functionally unreasonable due to factors such as the financial cost of compliance or the impact of complying for the duration of the construction or reconstruction of the major public project.
2. A major public project construction variance shall set forth the period or periods during which the variance is effective, which period or periods shall be the minimum reasonably necessary in light of the standard set forth in subsection 25.08.655.A, and the exterior sound level limits that will be in effect during the period of the variance. Different major public project construction variances may be issued for distinct phases of a construction project, or one major public project construction variance may be issued for the entire major public project. The period or periods during which a major public project construction variance is effective may be stated in terms of calendar dates or in terms of the duration of a construction project or a phase or phases of a construction project.
3. The Administrator shall condition a major public project construction variance as necessary to provide reasonable control or mitigation of the construction noise that may be expected to occur pursuant to the variance.
4. One-year review and decision

    1. No later than one year after the start of construction to which a major public project construction variance applies, the Administrator shall review, and provide opportunity for public comment on, the operation of the variance during the first year, including the provisions of the Noise Management and Mitigation Plan, and the conditions of the variance. For purposes of determining the date of the start of the project's construction work, site exploration work is excluded.
    2. After considering the public comments received, the Administrator may modify the terms and conditions of the variance or the Noise Management and Mitigation Plan as needed, or revoke the variance, if the Administrator determines that the current variance, the conditions of the variance, or the Noise Management and Mitigation Plan are not adequately protecting the public health and safety or reasonably controlling or mitigating the construction noise, or that there are more reasonable methods of doing so.
    3. The Administrator shall make a decision whether to modify or revoke a variance pursuant to this review within one-year and 90 days after the start of construction work as provided in subsection 25.08.655.D.1.
    4. Appeal. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Administrator whether to modify a variance pursuant to this subsection 25.08.655.D may appeal such decision by filing an appeal in writing with the Hearing Examiner by 5 p.m. of the tenth day following the date of the issuance of the decision. When the last day of the appeal period is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the appeal may be filed until 5 p.m. on the next business day. The Hearing Examiner appeal shall be conducted pursuant to Section 25.08.610.
    5. Effective date. The decision of the Administrator whether to modify a variance pursuant to this subsection 25.08.655.D is effective 30 days following the decision unless it is appealed to the Hearing Examiner. If the Administrator's decision is appealed to the Hearing Examiner, the Administrator's decision does not take effect and the original terms and conditions of the variance remain in effect until the effective date of the Hearing Examiner decision. The Hearing Examiner decision is a final decision of the City for purposes of chapter 36.70C RCW, and is effective 30 days from the date of the decision, unless otherwise ordered by a court. If a court stays the effective date of the decision, the original unmodified variance shall remain in effect during the stay.

4. Amendment of Citation. A citation may be amended prior to the conclusion of the hearing to conform to the evidence presented if substantial rights of the person cited are not thereby prejudiced.
5. Evidence at Hearing. The certified statement or declaration authorized by RCW 9A.72.085 submitted by a representative of the Administrator shall be prima facie evidence that a violation occurred and that the person cited is responsible. Any certifications or declarations authorized under RCW 9A.72.085 shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. The person cited may rebut the evidence and establish that the cited violation(s) did not occur or that the person contesting the citation is not responsible for the violation.
6. Disposition. If the citation is sustained at the hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order finding that the person cited committed the violation and shall impose the applicable penalty. If the Hearing Examiner determines that the violation did not occur, the Hearing Examiner shall enter an order dismissing the citation.
7. Appeal. The Hearing Examiner's decision is the final decision of the City. Any judicial review must be commenced within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision in accordance with RCW 36.70C.040.

#### 25.08.950 - Failure to appear for hearing.

### 25.09.020 - Environmentally critical areas definitions

The following are environmentally critical areas designated by this Chapter 25.09: geologic hazard areas, steep slope areas, flood-prone areas, wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, and abandoned landfills.


1. Geologic Hazard Areas and Steep Slope Areas.

    1. Geologic hazard areas are liquefaction-prone areas, landslide-prone areas, peat settlement-prone areas, seismic hazards areas and volcanic hazard areas described in subsections 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. Landslide-prone areas include steep slope areas. Steep slope areas that are regulated for additional erosion hazards are described in subsection 4.
    2. Liquefaction-prone Areas. Liquefaction-prone areas are areas typically underlain by cohesionless soils of low density, usually in association with a shallow groundwater table, that lose substantial strength during earthquakes.
    3. Landslide-prone Areas. The following are landslide-prone areas:

        1. Known landslide areas identified by documented history, or areas that have shown significant movement during the last ten thousand (10,000) years or are underlain by mass wastage debris deposited during this period; or
        2. Potential landslide areas:

            1. Those areas that are described as potential slide areas in "Seattle Landslide Study" (Shannon & Wilson, 2000 and 2003).
            2. Areas with indications of past landslide activity, such as landslide headscarps and sidescarps, hummocky terrain, areas with geologic conditions that can promote earth movement, and areas with signs of potential landsliding, such as springs, groundwater seepage, and bowed or backtilted trees.
            3. Areas with topographic expression of runout zones, such as fans and colluvial deposition at the toes of hillsides.
            4. Setbacks at the top of very steep slopes or bluffs, depending on soil conditions.
            5. Slopes with an incline of forty (40) percent or more within a vertical elevation change of at least ten feet (10').
For the purpose of this definition, a slope is measured by establishing its toe and top and averaging the inclination over at least ten feet (10') of elevation difference.

Also for the purpose of this definition:


1. The "toe" of a slope means a distinct topographic break in slope that separates slopes inclined at less than forty percent (40%) from slopes inclined at forty percent (40%) or more. Where no distinct break exists, the "toe" of a slope is the lower-most limit of the area where the ground surface drops ten feet (10') or more vertically within a horizontal distance of twenty-five feet (25'); and
2. The "top" of a slope is a distinct topographic break in slope that separates slopes inclined at less than forty percent (40%) from slopes inclined at forty percent (40%) or more. Where no distinct break exists, the "top" of a slope is the upper-most limit of the area where the ground surface drops ten feet (10') or more vertically within a horizontal distance of twenty-five feet (25').
3. Areas that would be covered under one of subsections (2) to (5), but where the topography has been previously modified through the provision of retaining walls or non-engineered cut and fill operations;
4. Any slope area potentially unstable as a result of rapid stream incision or stream bank erosion.
5. Steep Slope Areas. Steep slope areas are areas with a slope described in subsection A3b(5) above; provided that when such a slope is on a parcel in a Downtown zone or highrise zone, the area is designated only as a landslide prone area.
6. Peat Settlement-prone Areas.

    1. Peat settlement-prone areas, which consist of Category I and Category II peat settlement-prone areas, are delineated on Maps A1 through A26, Peat Settlement-prone Area Boundaries Maps, codified at the end of this chapter.
    2. The Director may, at the request of the owner of a parcel larger than 50,000 square feet, provide a parcel-specific delineation of the peat settlement-prone area boundary on that parcel. Where a parcel-specific delineation conflicts with the Peat Settlement-prone Area Boundaries Maps, the parcel-specific delineation shall apply. The parcel-specific delineation is based on the location of the relevant bog or bogs identified in City of Seattle Identified Bogs (Troost 2007) plus a buffer of 50 feet for Category I peat settlement-prone areas or a buffer of 25 feet for Category II peat settlement-prone areas.
7. Seismic Hazard Areas. In addition to liquefaction-prone areas described in subsection 2 above, seismic hazard areas are the following:

    1. Areas of the City subject to ground shaking from seismic hazards that are addressed by the Building Code (SMC Title 22).
    2. The Seattle Fault zone as delineated in Troost et al., 2005,  or as the Director determines is more accurately mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey, as set out in a Director's Rule.
    3. For tsunamis the waterbody of Lake Washington and for tsunamis and tsunami inundation, the water body and land area as shown in Walsh, et al., 2003,  or as the Director determines are more accurately mapped by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey or the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, as set out in a Director's Rule.
    4. The shoreline and upland areas surrounding Lake Washington are classified as an unknown risk from tsunamis under WAC 365-190-080(4)(b)(iii).
    5. For seiches, the waterbodies of Elliot Bay, Lake Union and Lake Washington.
    6. The shoreline and upland areas surrounding the waterbodies in subsection (e) are classified as an unknown risk from seiches under WAC 365-190-080(4)(b)(iii).
8. Volcanic Hazard Areas. Volcanic hazard areas are areas subject to inundation by lahars or related flooding resulting from volcanic activity on Mount Rainier, as delineated by the U.S. Geological Survey in Hoblitt, et al., 1998,  or as the Director determines are more accurately mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey, as set out in a Director's Rule.
9. Flood-prone areas. Flood-prone areas are those areas that would likely be covered with or carry water as a result of a 100 year flood event, or that would have a one percent or greater chance of being covered with or of carrying water in any given year based on current circumstances or maximum development permitted under existing zoning. This includes areas defined as areas of special flood hazard in Section 25.06.030 and areas mapped by Seattle Public Utilities.
10. Wetlands. Wetlands are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and stormwater ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to mitigate conversion of wetlands. Identification of wetlands and delineation of their boundaries pursuant to this Chapter 25.09 shall be done in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements.
11. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. The following are fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas:

    1. Areas mapped by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) as urban natural open space habitat areas.
    2. Areas designated by WDFW as priority habitats and species areas, including native eel grass beds, kelp beds, and recreational shellfish areas.
    3. Corridors connecting priority habitats and species areas or habitat areas for species of local importance meeting one of the following criteria:

        1. WDFW or the Department's species habitat management plan identifies the parcel as part of a corridor connecting habitat areas for priority species or species of local importance;
        2. the parcel is adjacent to or connects parcels containing priority species or species of local importance and the Director determines that the parcel is part of a wildlife corridor based on information provided by a qualified wildlife biologist or;
        3. the parcel provides fish passage between fish habitat in Type S, F, Np and Ns waters per WAC 222-16-030 and 222-16-031 upstream and downstream of the parcel, whether that passage is in riparian watercourses, pipes or culverts.
    4. Areas that provide habitat for species of local importance.
    5. Riparian corridors, which are the riparian watercourse and the riparian management area. The riparian watercourse is the watercourse of Type F, Np and Ns waters defined in WAC 222-16-030 and 222-16-031 that have fish or wildlife habitat. Water in surface water ditches and stormwater conveyances, pipes, culverts, flow control facilities and water quality facilities are not regulated as riparian watercourses. The riparian management area is the area within 100 feet measured horizontally landward from the top of each bank of the watercourse, or from the ordinary high water mark of the watercourse as surveyed in the field, if the top of the bank cannot be determined. In watercourses with braided channels or alluvial fans, the ordinary high water mark shall be determined so as to include the entire stream feature.

        1. When a pipe or culvert connecting Type S, F, Np and Ns waters per WAC 222-16-030 and 222-16-031 that have fish habitat downstream and upstream from the pipe or culvert is daylighted, the waters formerly in the pipe or culvert will be regulated as a riparian watercourse, and the area adjacent to that watercourse will be regulated as a riparian management area, as defined in subsection 25.09.020.D.5. This subsection 25.09.020.D.5.b does not apply when the pipe or culvert is removed to provide a publicly-owned facility designed primarily for water quality treatment, flow control or stormwater conveyance.
    6. Priority habitat areas as regulated in Sections 23.60A.156 and 23.60A.160 and setbacks as regulated in Sections 23.60A.156 and 23.60A.167, except that in the UI and UM shoreline environments the portion of the setback that is an environmental critical area, as regulated in Sections 23.60A.156 and 23.60A.167, is the setback measured from the ordinary high water mark landward 15 feet.
12. Abandoned Landfills. Abandoned landfills include those abandoned solid waste landfills identified by the Seattle-King County Health Department in their 1986 Abandoned Landfill Toxicity/Hazard Assessment Project, additional sites identified by public or historical research, and areas within one thousand feet (1,000') of methane-producing landfills.

### 25.09.030 - Location of environmentally critical areas and buffers

1. Environmentally critical areas are defined in Section 25.09.020, and buffers are described in Sections 25.09.160 and 25.09.180. Environmentally critical areas are mapped whenever possible. These maps are advisory except for the maps adopted as designations for geologically hazardous areas in subsections 25.09.020.A.5, 25.09.020.A.6, and 25.09.020.A.7, the FEMA maps showing areas of special flood hazard defined in subsection 25.06.030.B, and areas mapped or designated by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) in subsections 25.09.020.D.1 and 25.09.020.D.2. The Director may update or amend the maps by Director's Rule.
2. Determination of critical area or buffer location

    1. The Director shall determine whether a parcel contains an environmentally critical area or buffer before other provisions of this Chapter 25.09 are applied to a development proposal.
    2. If an application for development is proposed on a site that the Director believes contains a critical area or critical area buffer, an applicant may request a determination that a specific parcel of property does not contain a critical area or critical area buffer or that the critical area or buffer is located differently, including whether a critical area map should be changed, by applying for an exemption pursuant to subsection 25.09.045.D.1. In making the exemption determination the Director may consider the factors set out in subsection 25.09.030.B.4.
    3. If no application for development is proposed, a request for a formal determination whether a specific parcel contains a critical area or critical area buffer or of the location of a critical area or critical area buffer, including whether a critical area map should be amended, shall be made by applying for an interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Section 23.88.020. Interpretation decisions are not binding on subsequent applications for development if the facts supporting the interpretation or the designation criteria for a critical area or critical area buffer have changed. In making the interpretation the Director may consider the factors set out in subsection 25.09.030.B.4.
    4. Factors considered. In determining whether a parcel contains an environmentally critical area or buffer, the Director may consider the environmentally critical areas maps, site surveys, topographic maps, technical environmental analysis, and any other information the Director determines necessary. In determining whether development is subject to regulation under Section 25.09.110, the Director may consider only whether the development will occur within an area delineated pursuant to subsection 25.09.020. A.5.

### 25.09.040 - Permits and approvals required

1. Prior to undertaking development or platting on a parcel containing an environmentally critical area or buffer, the applicant shall (1) submit an application complying with the provisions of Section 25.09.330, unless the applicant applies for an approval under the provisions of Section 25.09.045, 25.09.055, or 25.09.320, and (2) obtain the Director's approval of the application. An application that includes a request for an exemption under subsection 25.09.045.D, or Sections 25.09.055 or 25.09.320, shall include a request for modification to the submittal requirements of Section 25.09.330.
2. Prior to undertaking actions under Section 25.09.045, 25.09.055, or subsection 25.09.200.A.4, the applicant shall obtain the Director's approval of the application under the applicable section. The applicant shall also obtain approval of a modification to the submittal requirements of Section 25.09.330 as part of compliance with subsection 25.09.045.D or Sections 25.09.055 or 25.09.320.
3. Prior to altering vegetation, trees, or habitat protected by this Chapter 25.09 the person responsible shall comply with the provisions of Section 25.09.320, unless that person complies with Section 25.09.045 or 25.09.055.

### 25.09.045 - Exemptions

1. When the Director determines that criteria in subsections D to J below are met, those activities are exempt from the provisions of this chapter, except Sections 25.09.017 and .030 B and as otherwise provided in this section.

    1. An application for an exemption may be made only as a component of a specific proposed development.
    2. The applicant for an exemption shall provide all information requested by the Director and demonstrate that the work qualifies for the exemption. The Director shall determine whether work is exempt and may impose conditions on the work to protect environmentally critical areas and buffers or other property.

        1. City agencies taking the action under any subsection of this section and the public agency taking the action under subsection J do not need to make an application to the Director provided that if no application is made, they shall comply with all provisions of this Section 25.09.045, make all determinations required to be made by the Director, including required conditions, and shall maintain records documenting compliance with all provisions.
2. All exempt activities shall be undertaken using best management practices; the applicant shall maintain records documenting compliance with this subsection B.
3. The enforcement provisions of this chapter apply to all activities exempted under this section. The Director's determination that a violation exists is not limited by determinations made by other City agencies or public agencies under subsection A3b, above.
4. Development not within an environmentally critical area

    1. Development on property the Director determines is not within an environmentally critical area or buffer is exempt from the provisions of this Chapter 25.09.
    2. Development that does not temporarily or permanently encroach within, alter, or increase the impact to the environmentally critical area or buffer on the parcel where the development occurs is exempt from the provisions of this Chapter 25.09; if existing development that encroaches within or impacts the environmentally critical area or buffer is removed, then new development that encroaches within, alters or impacts the environmentally critical area or buffer is not exempt.
5. Work directly related to ending a condition that (1) is an immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or creates an immediate risk of damage to public or private property and (2) requires remedial or preventive action in a timeframe too short to allow compliance with the application provisions of this chapter is exempt from those provisions, provided that the work is the minimum work necessary to end the condition and the work is consistent with the development standards of this chapter to the extent practicable. Once the Director determines that the condition no longer meets these criteria, all work is subject to the provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to its application requirements, its development standards, and any requirements for technical reports and reviews for work that was exempt at the time it was performed.
6. Maintenance, repair, renovation, or structural alteration of an existing structure that does not increase the impact to, or encroach further within, or further alter an environmentally critical area or buffer is exempt from the provisions of this chapter.

The following general development standards apply to development on parcels containing environmentally critical areas or their buffers, except as specifically provided in this Chapter 25.09:


1. Any required nondisturbance area shall be legibly shown and described on the site plan, and a covenant shall be required as set out in Section 25.09.335.
2. The project shall avoid adverse impacts from development on environmentally critical areas and buffers, and the Director shall restrict developmental coverage and construction activity areas to the most environmentally suitable, naturally stable, and least sensitive portion of the site in order to protect the ecological functions and values of wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat areas, prevent erosion from development on steep slope areas, and protect the public health, safety and welfare in landslide-prone, liquefaction-prone, and flood-prone areas. Grading activities and impervious surfaces that may impact environmentally critical areas or buffers shall be kept to a minimum and limited to areas approved by the Director.
3. Driveways and utility corridors that may impact environmentally critical areas or buffers shall be kept to a minimum through the use of common access drives and corridors where feasible. Roads, walkways, and parking areas should be designed parallel to topographic contours with consideration given to maintaining consolidated areas of natural topography and vegetation. Access shall be located in a way that keeps impacts to environmentally critical areas and buffers to a minimum.
4. All buffers and designated non-disturbance areas shall be fenced with a highly visible and durable protective barrier during construction to prevent access and to protect environmentally critical areas.
5. All site clearing on the lot that may impact environmentally critical areas or buffers shall be carried out in stages just prior to construction, and cleared areas shall be kept to the minimum for construction. Revegetation shall occur after the particular phase of construction is completed. When required by the Director, a tree and revegetation plan shall establish a staged vegetation removal and replacement program that keeps the amount of exposed soil during and after construction to a minimum. In drier months, temporary surface irrigation or temporary installation of intermediate plantings may be required until weather or seasonal conditions permit installation of the permanent plantings.
6. Construction activity on the lot that may impact environmentally critical areas or buffers shall adhere to a prepared schedule and mitigation plan approved by the Director prior to the start of construction. This schedule and mitigation plan shall include, but not be limited to, a schedule for compliance with project conditions, limits of construction and work activities, equipment to be used, start and duration of each phase, work sequencing, and shall include the design, implementation, maintenance, and monitoring of mitigation requirements to prevent erosion, siltation, and destruction of vegetation.
7. All grading in environmentally critical areas shall be completed or stabilized by October 31st of each year unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director based on approved technical analysis that no environmental harm or safety problems would result from grading between October 31st and April 1st. This provision does not apply to grading in liquefaction-prone areas and abandoned landfills environmentally critical areas unless the parcel contains another environmentally critical area.
8. Best management practices shall be used for all construction activity on parcels with or adjacent to environmentally critical areas or buffers to prevent sediment and other pollutants from entering the riparian corridor watercourses or other fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas on or off the property. Best management practices include, but are not limited to, installation of siltation barriers, diversion measures, slope drains, and structural, vegetative stabilization techniques and other methods prescribed in Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, the Stormwater Code.
9. The Director may require an erosion control plan and a tree and revegetation plan when erosion potential is severe. The erosion control plan shall be consistent with best management practices, and best management practices shall be followed in implementing it. The tree and revegetation plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional with landscaping, plant ecology and botany education and experience. All revegetation shall consist of native vegetation.
10. The site, including developmental coverage and construction activity areas, shall be managed in a manner sufficient to control stormwater and prevent erosion during construction, and shall be revegetated to promote stormwater control and prevent erosion after construction, consistent with Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, the Stormwater Code.
11. When calculating detention requirements, all disturbed areas on the site shall be calculated as developmental coverage, including revegetated areas, excluding enhanced or restored areas as approved by the Director.
12. Pesticides and fertilizers shall not be applied within (50) feet of a riparian corridor watercourse, wetland or shoreline except as allowed by the Director for the following circumstances and when allowed pesticide applications will be done by a licensed applicator:

    1. The state or local Health Department recommends or directs their use to address a threat to public health, or
    2. A county, state, or federal agency with jurisdiction directs their use for control of a state listed noxious weed or plant pests covered by the Washington State Department of Agriculture plant pest program, and when non-chemical alternatives have been evaluated, or
    3. When the Director determines the applicant has demonstrated that the use will have no adverse impact to fish and wildlife. Such a determination may be in the form of concurring that the applicant has developed best management practices or an integrated pest management plan consistent with standards developed by the Director, or
    4. When the Director has determined that use of a pesticide to control invasive plants would have less overall environmental impact than other control strategies, or
    5. When the Director determines there is a serious threat to public safety, health, or the environment.
13. The Director may require a development proposal's design to account for a one hundred (100) year seismic and one hundred (100) year flood event, unless a design for a greater event is required by other applicable codes.
14. The Director may require additional construction practices and methods and requirements, including, but not limited to best management practices as outlined in federal, state and Seattle manuals, and limitations on construction equipment permitted on the site, to protect environmentally critical areas and buffers on and off the property.
15. No provision of this chapter shall be construed to require putting new or existing power lines underground.

### 25.09.080 - Landslide-prone critical areas.

1. This section applies to all parcels in or containing a landslide-prone critical area.
2. Site.

    1. Complete stabilization of all portions of a site that are disturbed or affected by the proposed development, including all developmental coverage and construction activity areas, is required. Complete stabilization of all portions of a site refers to the process and actions necessary to stabilize proposed site improvements, and all on-site areas and adjacent properties, including adjacent public and private rights-of-way, that are disturbed or affected.
    2. The proposed development shall be limited and controlled to avoid adverse impacts and potential harm, and to provide safe, stable and compatible development appropriate to site conditions. Other reasonable and appropriate solutions to provide site stability may be required by the Director. This may include imposing conditions concerning the type and method of construction that reflect the specific constraints of the site.
    3. Removal of, clearing, or any action detrimental to trees or vegetation in landslide prone critical areas is prohibited, except as provided in this section and Section 25.09.320.
3. Third-Party Review. In addition to requiring the information provided pursuant to Section 25.09.330 and to Director's Rules, the Director may require third-party review when the professional opinions of the applicant's representative and the Department's reviewers cannot be reconciled. Third-party review requires the applicant's geotechnical and/or additional technical studies to be reviewed by an independent third party, paid for by the applicant but hired by the Director. Third-party review shall be conducted by a qualified engineering consultant.
4. Bonds and Insurance. The Director may require adequate bonds and/or insurance to cover potential claims for property damage that may arise from or be related to excavation or fill within a landslide-prone area when the depth of the proposed excavation exceeds four feet (4') and the bottom of the proposed excavation is below the one hundred percent (100%) slope line (forty-five (45) degrees from a horizontal line) from the property line. The Director may require such bonds and insurance in other circumstances where the Director determines that there is a potential for significant harm to an environmentally critical area or buffer during the construction process.
5. Permit Renewals. In addition to complying with the permit renewal standards in Chapter 23.76, applications for permit renewal shall comply with the following standards.

    1. The Director may renew a permit for development that is in conformance with applicable regulations in effect at the time the renewal is sought.
    2. An applicant seeking to renew a permit for new development in a landslide-prone area must submit a letter of certification from the current project geotechnical engineer of record as described in subsection G2. If such a letter of certification is not submitted, the permit shall not be renewed.
    3. The Director may renew a permit for development in a landslide-prone area if, after considering the information submitted in conformance with subsections G, he or she determines that there is no increased risk of damage to the proposed development, to neighboring properties, or to the drainage basin. In making such a determination the Director may impose new conditions or require the submittal of revised plans.
    4. An applicant for renewal also must demonstrate that any required bond or insurance will be in effect during the renewal period, and that the amount of such bond or insurance still is appropriate. The Director may require a bond or insurance as a condition of renewal even if such bond or insurance was not required previously.
6. Issued permits in landslide-prone areas. If the Director has reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency exists because significant changes in conditions at a project site or in the surrounding area may have occurred since a permit was issued, increasing the risk of damage to the proposed development, to neighboring properties, or to the drainage basin, the Director may by letter or other reasonable means of notification suspend the permit until the applicant has submitted a letter of certification as described in subsection G2 and has satisfied the standards of that section.
7. Letter of Certification.

    1. The Director may require a letter of certification based on such factors as the presence of known slides, indications of changed conditions at the site or the surrounding area, or other indications of unstable soils.
    2. The letter of certification shall be from the current project geotechnical engineer of record stating that a geotechnical engineer has inspected the site and area surrounding the proposed development within the sixty (60) days preceding submittal of the letter; and that:

        1. In the project geotechnical engineer's professional opinion no significant changes in conditions at the site or surrounding area have occurred that render invalid or out-of-date the analysis and recommendations contained in the technical reports and other application materials previously submitted to the Department as part of the application for the permit; or that
        2. In the project geotechnical engineer's professional opinion changes in conditions at the site or surrounding area have occurred that require revision to project criteria, and that in the project geotechnical engineer's professional opinion all technical reports and any necessary revised drawings that account for the changed conditions have been prepared and submitted.

### 25.09.100 - Development standards for liquefaction-prone areas.

1. The general development standards set out in SMC 25.09.060 do not apply to liquefaction prone areas.
2. Soils engineering studies may be required for development in liquefaction-prone areas to determine the physical properties of the surficial soils, especially the thickness of unconsolidated deposits, and their liquefaction potential, as set out in Title 22, Subtitle I.
3. If it is determined that the site is subject to liquefaction, mitigation measures may be imposed pursuant to Title 22, Subtitle I, in addition to other applicable codes or regulations pertaining to development in liquefaction-prone areas.

### 25.09.110 - Development standards for peat settlement-prone areas.

1. The general development standards set out in Section 25.09.060 do not apply to peat settlement-prone areas.
2. A geotechnical study detailing the location of the annual high static groundwater level is required for development in peat settlement-prone areas that involve excavation more than thirty (30) inches below the existing grade.
3. No development shall occur within a peat settlement-prone area below the annual high static groundwater level except to the minimum extent the Director deems necessary to allow the following:

    1. Structural components required under Title 22, Subtitle I and IA, the Building Code and Residential Code;
    2. Utility lines, including but not limited to drainage and sanitary side sewers and stormwater conveyance facilities, but excluding groundwater collection systems;
    3. Geotechnical testing;
    4. Maintenance, repair, renovation, or structural alteration of an existing structure if that activity, even though it might involve construction activity below the annual high static groundwater level, does not increase the extent of the structure below the annual high static groundwater level;
    5. Aquatic habitat restoration;
    6. Infiltration facilities or other development designed primarily to encourage recharge or infiltration of water to the groundwater;
    7. Replacement of contaminated soils with other soils or fills when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that the removal will not increase the likelihood of settlement on off-site parcels;
    8. Public utility facilities designed to provide drinking water, control flooding or protect against sanitary or combined sewer overflow when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that the facilities have been designed to avoid or minimize to the maximum extent practicable impacts to the groundwater regime; or
    9. Elevator pits necessary to meet accessibility standards required by City law.
4. Groundwater collection systems are prohibited in peat settlement-prone area unless otherwise required by law.
5. Development in a Category I peat settlement-prone area shall not increase the total impervious surface on the site unless the Director approves using an infiltration facility or soil amendments that offset the lost infiltration function. The Director may waive this requirement to the extent offsetting the lost infiltration function would adversely affect a landslide-prone area or steep slope area.
6. For construction activity in a peat settlement-prone area, the Director may require additional construction practices, methods, and restrictions that limit temporary groundwater de-watering.
7. In a peat settlement-prone area, land-disturbing activities with the potential to modify the groundwater regime are limited to the minimum reasonably necessary for development. Surface drainage systems or substantial earth modifications shall be professionally designed to prevent maintenance problems and adverse impacts to off-site parcels.
8. In addition to requiring the information provided pursuant to Section 25.09.330 and to Director's Rules, the Director may require third-party review when the professional opinions of the applicant's representative and the Department's reviewers cannot be reconciled. Third-party review requires the applicant's geotechnical and/or additional technical studies to be reviewed by an independent third party, paid for by the applicant but hired by the Director. Third-party review shall be conducted by a qualified engineering consultant.
9. The Director may waive compliance with some or all of the requirements of subsections B - G for a project in a Category II peat settlement-prone area to the extent the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that the project has been designed to avoid adverse impacts to off-site parcels from peat settlement. Such impacts include but are not limited to any adverse, off-site effect resulting from temporary dewatering during construction, groundwater inflow due to normal operation and maintenance of underground structures, groundwater inflow due to potential future leaks that could occur in underground structures, and reduced impervious surface. Projects qualifying for a waiver under this subsection may include but are not limited to the following:

    1. Projects involving concurrent removal of all peat contained in an entire peat settlement-prone area;
    2. Concurrent development or redevelopment of the entire peat settlement-prone area that is designed to minimize modification of the groundwater table and avoid impacts of future settlement through design of new structures; or
    3. Projects that are designed to minimize modification of the groundwater regime and that avoid potential adverse, off-site settlement impacts by retrofitting existing structures on off-site parcels within the entire peat settlement-prone area.
10. Standards for height and floor area ratio may be modified on lots containing a peat settlement-prone environmentally critical area as provided in 23.47A.012 and 23.47A.013.
11. Nothing in this section (including but not limited to subsection I) limits the authority of the Director pursuant to other applicable codes or regulations (including but not limited to Title 22, Subtitles I and IA, the Building Code and Residential Code) to require additional studies or impose additional conditions to address project-related risks arising in peat settlement-prone areas.

### 25.09.120 - Development standards for flood-prone areas

All development shall meet the applicable requirements of Chapter 25.06, Seattle Floodplain Development Ordinance; Chapter 22.100, Seattle Building Code; Chapter 22.150, Seattle Residential Code; Chapter 22.170, Seattle Grading Code; and Chapter 22.800, Seattle Stormwater Code.


### 25.09.160 - Development standards for wetlands

A wetland with a moderate level of function is one that scores 20 to 28 points for habitat function when rated according to Washington State Ecology publication #04-06-025. A wetland with a high level of function for habitat is one that scores of 29 to 36 points for habitat function when rated according to Washington State Ecology publication #04-06-025.


1. Wetlands constructed in upland areas or non-wetland areas by any person for stormwater control, biofiltration or aesthetic purposes are not subject to the wetland buffer requirements of this Chapter. Maintenance activities are not restricted in these types of wetlands.
2. Development is prohibited in wetland buffers, except as approved by the Director under subsection 25.09.160.D.
3. The Director may authorize development in a Category IV wetland under 1,000 square feet that does not have the characteristics described in subsection 25.09.160.B.1.c above, when the Director finds that one of the following measures, which must occur on site, will mitigate wetland function lost by development:

    1. Construct a wetland of equal function to the lost wetland function.
    2. Plant an area of native vegetation equal or greater in size to the area of the developed wetland, and remove invasive species in the area to be planted.
    3. Construct a bioengineered/infiltration facility, such as a bioretention cell or bioretention plant, that replicates the hydrologic and/or water quality benefit of the developed wetland. This facility shall be designed according to the requirements of Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, Stormwater Code and associated Director's Rules.
    4. Construct a green roof or roof garden that replicates the hydrologic and/or water quality benefit of the developed wetland. These facilities shall be designed according to the requirements of Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, Stormwater Code and associated Director's Rules.
4. Buffer vegetation

    1. In the wetland buffer, any action detrimental to habitat, trees or vegetation, including but not limited to clearing or removal, is prohibited, except as provided in subsection 25.09.160.D and in Sections 23.60A.190, 25.09.055, 25.09.300, and 25.09.320.
    2. Invasive plants and noxious weeds may be removed by hand. No machines or chemical removal shall be permitted without the Director's approval.
A high level of function for habitat shall be determined as set out in Subsection C1 above.


1. Buffer Reductions.

    1. The Director may reduce a Category IV wetland buffer when the applicant qualifies for a variance by demonstrating that:

        1. the lot where the buffer is located was in existence before October 31, 1992;
        2. the proposed development otherwise meets the criteria for granting a variance under Section 25.09.280B, except that reducing the front or rear yard or setbacks will not both mitigate the hardship and maintain the full buffer; and
        3. either the site does not meet the criteria for buffer averaging under subsection D1 or such averaging does not relieve the hardship that was found under subsection 25.09.280 B2.
    2. If any buffer reduction is authorized by a variance under subsection D2a, the Director shall

        1. require the Category IV wetland to be restored on site in a manner that improves water quality, hydrology and habitat functions. Restoration must comply with subsections F and G below and with the Department of Ecology Guidelines for Developing Freshwater Wetlands Mitigation Plans and Proposals, 1994 (#94-29); and
        2. determine the amount of wetland buffer to reduce by applying the buffer averaging to the extent possible under subsection D1 and reducing the yards and setbacks before reducing the wetland buffer, unless reducing the yards or setbacks is injurious to safety. The wetland buffer shall be reduced by the minimum amount to mitigate the hardship, but never to less than thirty five feet (35'); and
        3. impose additional conditions on the location and other features of a proposed development as necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter and to mitigate the loss or reduction of the yard, setback or buffer.
2. The process and procedure for a variance under this subsection D2 shall be as prescribed for Type II land use decisions in Chapter 23.76.

1. Replacement ratios may be increased under the following circumstances to achieve the equivalent wetland function of the wetland that is altered:

    1. Uncertainty exists as to the probable success of the proposed restoration or creation; or
    2. A significant period of time will elapse between impact and establishment of wetland functions at the mitigation site; or
    3. Proposed mitigation will result in a lower category wetland or reduced functions relative to the wetland being impacted.
2. Replacement ratios may be decreased when the proposed mitigation actions are conducted in advance of the impact and result in no net loss in wetland functions.
3. If the applicant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the avoidance and mitigation standards required in subsection 25.09.160.E.5.a will deprive the applicant of reasonable use of the applicant's property, the Director may waive or modify the standards to the extent necessary to allow reasonable use as part of the exception under Section 25.09.300. Notwithstanding such demonstration, the Director may deny the waiver if the Director determines that not applying these standards would cause significant injury to occupiers of the land, to other properties, to public resources, or to the environment.

1. Wetlands are rated according to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (Ecology Publication #04-06-25). Illegal grading, filling, draining, or other development will not result in a change to that wetland's rating. Wetlands constructed for mitigation or replacement purposes are subject to the provisions of this Chapter 25.09.
2. Impacts to wetlands

    1. Development, including but not limited to grading, filling, or draining, is prohibited within or over:

        1. Category I, II or III wetlands greater than 100 square feet;
        2. Category IV wetlands 1,000 square feet or greater;
        3. A wetland of any category or size that is part of a larger wetland system or abuts any Type S, F, Np and Ns water per WAC 222-16-030 and 031.
    2. Development may occur within or over Category IV wetlands less than 1,000 square feet, other than those wetlands described in subsection 25.09.160.B.1.c, in accordance with subsection 25.09.160.C.3.
    3. When development is authorized on a parcel containing a wetland:

        1. Development shall comply with subsection 22.805.020.G and all other applicable sections of the Storm Water Code; and
        2. Direct lighting shall be directed away from the wetland and its buffer.
    4. In a wetland of any category or size, any action detrimental to habitat, trees or vegetation, including but not limited to clearing or removal, is prohibited, except as provided in Sections 23.60A.190, 25.09.045, 25.09.300, and 25.09.320.
3. Wetland buffers and mitigation

    1. Establishment of buffers.

        1. The wetland buffer is measured horizontally from the edge of the wetland.
        2. Wetlands have the following buffers:
4. Buffer Averaging and Buffer Reductions.

    1. Buffer Width Averaging. The Director may modify the standard wetland buffer width by averaging buffer widths when a qualified wetlands professional demonstrates to the Director's satisfaction that:

        1. It will not reduce wetland functions or values;
        2. The total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no less than that which would be contained within the buffer required in subsection C above; and
        3. The buffer width is not reduced to less than the following:
5. Avoidance and mitigation standards

    1. If an exception to the standards of this Section 25.09.160 is approved under Section 25.09.300, the Director shall require application of the following standards for wetland mitigation in following order of priority:

        1. avoid the impact to the extent practicable by not taking all or part of an action;
        2. keep the impact to a minimum by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, and by taking affirmative actions to mitigate the impact over time; and
        3. mitigate unavoidable impacts to the designated uses of a wetland by replacement, enhancement, or other approved compensation methods.
    2. Mitigation for grading, filling, or draining wetlands shall achieve the equivalent or better biologic functions of the existing wetland. Mitigation plans shall be consistent with Washington State Department of Ecology Publication #06-06-011b, Wetland Mitigation in Washington State—Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans (Version 1), or the most current Department of Ecology publication addressing wetland mitigation.
    3. Wetland mitigation actions shall not result in a net loss of wetland area unless the following criteria are met as determined by a site-specific function assessment:

        1. The lost wetland area provides only minimal functions and the mitigation action(s) results in a net gain in wetland functions; or
        2. The lost wetland area provides only minimal functions and other replacement areas provide greater benefits to the functioning of the watershed, such as riparian habitat restoration and enhancement.
    4. Mitigation actions that require compensation by replacing, enhancing, or substitution, shall occur in the following order of preference:

        1. Restoring wetlands on sites that were formerly wetlands.
        2. Creating wetlands on disturbed sites, such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of exotic introduced species.
        3. Enhancing wetlands and/or wetland buffers with significantly degraded functions and values. The amount of required enhancement is dependent on the wetland classification in subsection 5.
    5. The following ratios are required for the restoration, creation or enhancement of wetlands for authorized alterations. As determined by the Director, wetland mitigation may include the preservation and enhancement of habitat if it provides greater ecological function than the existing wetland. The first number specifies the area of replacement wetlands, and second specifies the area of wetlands altered:
6. Mitigation Timing. Any restoration, creation or enhancement of wetlands that is required as mitigation shall be completed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the displacing use. If that has not occurred or if no certificate of occupancy is needed, the applicant shall submit plans that establish a specific schedule for completion, which must be approved by the Director, and shall provide a bond of at least one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the cost of installation, in addition to the monitoring plan and bond required under subsection G. If the required mitigation can be completed for less than five thousand dollars ($5,000), no bond is required under subsection F or G.
7. A monitoring plan shall be prepared to monitor successful re-establishment of the wetland for a period of five growing seasons or the period required to achieve the performance standards of the plan, whichever is earlier. The applicant shall provide a bond in an amount of at least one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the cost to retain a qualified wetlands scientist to assess the wetland and submit a report to the City at least twice yearly, prior to and near the end of each growing season and shall also provide a bond in an amount sufficient to implement additional restoration measures if the replacement wetland does not equal the functions of the wetland displaced at the end of five growing seasons.
8. Other Agency Regulations. Review of projects subject to the wetland provisions of this chapter shall be coordinated by the applicant with the appropriate state and federal agencies. The applicant should make early contact with these agencies to ensure compliance with local, state and federal regulations.
9. In addition the information provided pursuant to Section 25.09.330 and to Director's Rule, the Director may require third-party review when the professional opinions of the applicant's representative and the Department's reviewers cannot be reconciled. The third party review will be conducted by a qualified wetland consultant hired by the Director and paid for by the applicant.

### 25.09.180 - Development standards for steep slope areas

1. This Section 25.09.180 and Section 25.09.080 apply to parcels containing a steep slope area or buffer.
2. Impacts on steep slope areas

    1. Development is prohibited on steep slope areas, unless the applicant demonstrates that the provisions of subsections 25.09.180.B.2 or 25.09.180.E apply.
    2. Provided that all the provisions of this Chapter 25.09 and all applicable provisions of Title 23 and Chapters 22.800 through 22.808 are met, subsection 25.09.180.B.1 does not apply when the applicant demonstrates the development meets one of the following criteria. In determining whether these criteria are met, the Director may require a geotechnical report to verify site conditions and to evaluate the impacts of the development in the steep slope area and shall require such a report for criteria in subsections 25.09.180.B.2.c and 25.09.180.B.2.d. The geotechnical report is subject to the provisions for third party review in subsection 25.09.080.C.

        1. Development is located where existing development is located, if the impact on the steep slope area is not altered or increased; or
        2. Development is located on steep slope areas that have been created through previous legal grading activities, including rockeries or retaining walls resulting from rights of way improvements, if no adverse impact on the steep slope area will result; or
        3. Development is located on steep slope areas that are less than 20 feet in vertical rise and that are 30 feet or more from other steep slope areas, if no adverse impact on the steep slope area will result; or
        4. Development is located on steep slope areas where the Director determines that application of subsection 25.09.180.B.1 would prevent necessary stabilization of a landslide-prone area.
    3. Clearing vegetation or any type of vegetation and site restoration management authorized under this Chapter 25.09 is not "development" for purposes of applying any of the provisions of subsection 25.09.180.B.2.
3. Buffers.

    1. Steep slopes have fifteen-foot (15') buffers from the top and toe of a slope unless the Director determines that a greater or lesser buffer is required based on the following considerations:

        1. Proposed construction method and its effect on the stability of the slope and erosion potential;
        2. Techniques used to keep the disruption of existing topography and vegetation to a minimum; and
        3. Preparation of technical reports and plans to address and propose remedies regarding soils and hydrology site constraints.
    2. Development is prohibited on steep slope area buffers, except as authorized in subsection B2 or to provide access to such an area, which shall be kept to a minimum, and except as provided in subsection E.
4. Vegetation Removal and Replanting. If removal of trees or vegetation in a steep slope area and its buffer is authorized as part of approved development, it shall be kept to a minimum, and shall be carried out pursuant to a tree and revegetation plan described in section 25.09.320. Other removal of, clearing, or any action detrimental to trees or vegetation in a steep slope area or buffer is prohibited, except as provided in Section 25.09.320. In addition to complying with Section 25.09.320, any replanting that occurs shall consist of native vegetation.
5. Steep Slope Area Variance. The Director may reduce the steep slope area buffer and may authorize limited intrusion into the steep slope area and steep slope buffer to the extent allowed in subsection E2 only when the applicant qualifies for a variance by demonstrating that:

    1. the lot where the steep slope or steep slope buffer is located was in existence before October 31, 1992; and
    2. the proposed development otherwise meets the criteria for granting a variance under Section 25.09.280B, except that reducing the front or rear yard or setbacks will not both mitigate the hardship and maintain the full steep slope area buffer.
    3. If any buffer reduction or development in the critical area is authorized by a variance under subsection E1, it shall be the minimum to afford relief from the hardship and shall be in the following sequence of priority:

        1. reduce the yards and setbacks, to the extent reducing the yards or setbacks is not injurious to safety;
        2. reduce the steep slope area buffer;
        3. allow an intrusion into not more than thirty percent (30%) of the steep slope area.
    4. The Director may impose additional conditions on the location and other features of the proposed development as necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter and mitigate the reduction or loss of the yard, setback, or steep slope area or buffer.
    5. The process and procedures for a variance under this subsection E shall be as prescribed for Type II land use decisions in Chapter 23.76.

### 25.09.200 - Development standards for fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas

1. Development standards for parcels with riparian corridors

    1. a. The provisions of this subsection 25.09.200.A apply to all development on parcels containing riparian corridors as defined in subsection 25.09.020.D.5. In addition, the provisions of subsection 25.09.200.C apply to these parcels, except subsection 25.09.200.C.2 with respect to fish. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict between the provisions of subsection 25.09.200.C and this subsection 25.09.200.A, the most restrictive provision applies.

        1. It is the long term goal of the City to restore the City's riparian corridors and to protect salmon passage in such corridors where scientifically justified. The City has determined that best available science supports protecting these riparian corridors as described in this Chapter 25.09. Where past development has encroached into riparian corridors, redevelopment shall be regulated subject to the provisions in Section 25.09.045.
    2. Riparian watercourse

        1. Development is prohibited within or over the watercourse, except as provided in this subsection 25.09.200.A.2.a or subsection 25.09.020.A.2.b. If no other access is available to the property, the Director may approve access over the watercourse, provided that it maintains the natural channel and floodway of the watercourse and that disturbance of the riparian management area is kept to a minimum.
        2. On Haller and Bitter Lakes, piers are regulated pursuant to the development standards for similar structures in the Shoreline District, Chapter 23.60A, Subchapter XV, The Urban Residential Environment, Sections 23.60A.152, and 23.60A.187. If a pier is allowed, access to it through the riparian management area is also allowed, provided the impact on the naturally functioning condition of the riparian management area from the pier's location, method of construction, and construction materials is kept to a minimum.
        3. In the riparian watercourse any action detrimental to habitat, trees or vegetation including but not limited to clearing or removal, is prohibited, except as provided in Section 25.09.320.
    3. Riparian management area

        1. The riparian management area is defined in subsection 25.09.020.D.5. Existing public or private streets are excluded from the regulations for the riparian management area unless the provisions of Chapters 22.800 through 22.808, the Stormwater Code apply, in which case the Director shall require adequate stormwater detention to prevent harm from the street to habitat on the parcel and downstream and to keep degradation of water quality for habitat to a minimum.
        2. Activities in the riparian management area

            1. Development is prohibited in the riparian management area, except to provide access to development approved under subsection 25.09.200.A.2 and except under subsections 22.09.200.A.3.b.2, 25.09.200.A.3.c, and 25.09.200.A.3.d.
            2. In the riparian management area any action detrimental to habitat, trees or vegetation, including but not limited to clearing or removal, is prohibited, except as provided in subsection 25.09.200.A.3.c and Section 25.09.320.
        3. Riparian Management Area Vegetation.

            1. If the vegetation in the riparian management area protects the fish habitat and wildlife habitat as they exist on the site at the time development is proposed, including preventing erosion and protecting water quality, the existing vegetation shall remain undisturbed, except as allowed under Section 25.09.320.
            2. If the riparian management area is not functioning in the manner set out in subsection 25.09.200.A.3.c.1 above, the applicant shall prepare and carry out a tree and vegetation plan that augments the existing vegetation with native vegetation to the extent commensurate with the impact of the development on the riparian management area. The plan shall be prepared and executed consistent with Section 25.09.320. Vegetation in the riparian management area shall not be removed or otherwise disturbed until the applicant is ready to immediately replant according to the approved plan. A monitoring plan shall be prepared to monitor the establishment of the vegetation. The plan shall cover five growing seasons or the period needed to successfully carry out the plan, whichever is earlier.
        4. In addition to subsections 25.09.200.A.3.b.2 and 25.09.200.A.3.c, development is allowed in the riparian management area on lots existing prior to May 9, 2006 if the applicant demonstrates that:

            1. the development is in the limited riparian development area, which is the area in the riparian corridor but outside of the watercourse and more than 75 feet from the top of the watercourse bank for Type F waters with anadromous fish present for any part of the year, more than 50 feet from the top of the watercourse bank for Type F waters where anadromous fish are not present for any part of the year and more than 50 feet from the top of the watercourse bank for Type Np and Ns waters;
            2. the development complies with Section 22.805.080 and 22.805.090, regardless of the area of land disturbing activity or the size of the addition or replacement of impervious surface, except as provided in subsection 25.09.200.3.e; and
            3. any development, including but not limited to coverage by impervious surface, does not exceed 35 percent of the total area of the limited riparian development area, provided that the maximum lot coverage does not exceed that allowed under Title 23, and except as provided in subsection 25.09.200.3.e.
        5. When compliance with Sections 22.805.080 and 22.805.090 is required solely based on subsection 25.09.200.3.d.2 above, the Director may approve a restoration plan in lieu of requiring compliance with subsections 25.09.200.3.d.2 and 25.09.200.3.d.3 if the applicant demonstrates that the plan meets the following criteria:

            1. The watercourse or riparian management area function will be restored so that it prevents erosion, protects water quality, and provides diverse habitat; and
            2. The restoration results in greater protection of the watercourse and riparian management area than compliance with subsections 25.09.200.3.d.2 and 25.09.200.3.d.3.
    4. Daylighting water in pipes and culverts

        1. Pursuant to Section 25.09.200.D, the Director may require daylighting pipes and culverts that meet the definition of fish and wildlife corridors in Section 25.09.020.D.3.c.
        2. The City encourages daylighting pipes and culverts connecting Type S, F, Np and Ns waters that have fish habitat downstream and upstream from the pipe or culvert, and the Director is authorized to modify development standards as set out in subsection 25.09.200.A.4.c below when the applicant submits a plan for daylighting such a pipe or culvert that meets the following criteria:

            1. the plan is prepared by a qualified professional;
            2. the ecological functions of the daylighted waters and adjacent area are improved so the new riparian corridor area is compatible with and protects the ecological functions of the existing riparian corridor upstream and downstream and does not contribute to flooding; ecological functions include preventing erosion, protecting water quality, and providing diverse habitat; and
            3. if the plan proposes daylighting the pipe or culvert in a different location on the parcel from its current location or off the parcel, the ecological functions required in subsection (2) above are provided as effectively as they would be without the relocation.
        3. If the Director finds the conditions in subsection 4b are met, the Director may modify the following development standards. The modification shall be the minimum to provide sufficient area to meet the standards in subsection 4b and shall be in the following order of priority:

            1. Yard and/or setback requirements on the property may be reduced, unless reducing them is injurious to safety.
            2. The riparian corridor watercourse and adjacent area maintained as a riparian management area under the approved plan may count toward open space requirements for all multifamily or commercial zone requirements.
            3. Required parking may be reduced up to twenty five percent (25%).
            4. The riparian management area may be reduced.
        4. Nothing in this subsection alters the rights of the owner of the pipe or culvert, if that person is not an applicant for a permit.
    5. Other Agency Regulations. Review of projects subject to the riparian corridor provisions of this chapter shall be coordinated with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife when hydraulic project approval is required, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers when they have jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. The applicant is encouraged to make early contact with these agencies to ensure compliance with local, state and federal riparian corridor regulations.
2. 1. Development on parcels containing fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall comply with any species habitat management plan set out in a Director's Rule. The Director may establish by rule a species habitat management plan to protect any priority species identified by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife or to protect species of local importance.

    1. Any person proposing development on a parcel containing fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall consult with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife and comply with any requirements of that agency, except as limited in subsections 25.09.200.A and 25.09.200.B.
3. Based on information provided by a qualified wildlife biologist, the Director may condition development on parcels containing wildlife habitat or corridors defined in subsection 25.09.020.D.3 to protect fish or wildlife habitat corridors. Conditions may include, but are not limited to:

    1. Establishment of buffer zones;
    2. Preservation of important vegetation and habitat features;
    3. Limitation of access to habitat areas;
    4. Seasonal restriction of construction activities;
    5. Preservation of the ability for fish to pass between fish habitat in Type S, F, Np and Ns waters upstream and downstream of the parcel. The application requirements and general conditions of this Chapter 25.09, Sections 25.09.330 and 25.09.060, do not apply if the person responsible for development of the parcel has either a Hydraulic Project Approval from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife or a Section 404 permit under the federal Clean Water Act from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Nothing in this subsection 25.09.200.C alters the rights of the owner of the pipe or culvert, if that person is not an applicant for a permit.
    6. Requiring the developer to daylight a pipe or culvert defined in subsection 25.09.020.D.3.c, when the conditions in subsection 25.09.200.C.6.a below are met. When requiring daylighting, the Director is authorized to modify the conditions set out in subsection 25.09.200.C.6.b. Nothing in this subsection 25.09.200.C.6 alters the rights of the owner of the pipe or culvert, if that person is not an applicant for a permit.

        1. The Director may require daylighting under the following conditions:

            1. When the existing pipe or culvert cannot remain in its current location and provide an effective passage for anadromous fish due to the development.
            2. Other methods for preserving fish passage such as pipe or culvert placement or site engineering are not feasible.
        2. If daylighting is required then the applicant must prepare a plan that demonstrates the following:

            1. The ecological functions of the daylighted waters and resulting new riparian management area are compatible with and protect the functions of pipes and culverts upstream and downstream and the ecological functions of the existing riparian corridor upstream and downstream and do not contribute to flooding.
            2. The ecological functions include preventing erosion, protecting water quality, and providing diverse habitat.
        3. The Director determines that daylighting the pipe or culvert and the impacts from the development to fish passage on the parcel are roughly proportionate.
        4. When requiring daylighting, the Director is authorized to modify the following conditions:

            1. Yard and/or setback requirements on the property may be reduced to provide sufficient area for daylighting and creating a riparian management area, unless reducing them is injurious to safety.
            2. The riparian corridor watercourse and riparian management area may count toward open space requirements for all multifamily or commercial zone requirements.
            3. Required parking may be reduced up to 25 percent.
            4. The riparian management area may be reduced to the extent needed to provide sufficient area for the plan described in subsection 25.09.200.C.6.a.2.
4. Designating species of local importance and their habitat

    1. The Director on an annual basis shall accept and consider nominations for species of wildlife and their habitat to be designated as locally important. The designation of a species of local importance and its habitat shall require an amendment to this Chapter 25.09.
    2. Species or habitat to be designated shall exhibit the following characteristics:

        1. Local populations of native species are in danger of extinction based on existing trends:

            1. Local populations of native species that are likely to become endangered; or
            2. Local populations of native species that are vulnerable or declining;
        2. The species has recreational, commercial, game, tribal, or other special value;
        3. Long-term persistence of a species is dependent on the protection, maintenance, and/or restoration of the nominated habitat;
        4. Protection by other county, state, or federal policies, laws, regulations, or nonregulatory tools is not adequate to prevent degradation of the species or habitat in Seattle;
        5. Areas nominated to protect a particular habitat or species have either high-quality habitat or habitat with a high potential to recover to a suitable quality, and the habitat is limited in quantity, highly vulnerable to alteration, or connects habitats.
    3. Species and habitats may be nominated for designation by any person. Nominations shall be in writing, address the characteristics listed in subsection 25.09.200.D.2, and state whether specific habitat features are being nominated (for example, next sites, breeding areas, and nurseries), or whether the habitat or ecosystem is being nominated in its entirety. Where restoration of habitat is proposed, a specific plan for restoration shall be provided with the application, or the nomination shall include management strategies for the species or habitats. Restoration plans and management strategies shall be supported by the best available science.
    4. The Director shall determine whether the nomination proposal is complete, and if complete, shall evaluate it under the criteria in subsection 25.09.200.D.2 and make a recommendation to the Mayor and Council based on that information. If the nomination is adopted, the Director may establish habitat restoration plans and habitat and species management strategies by rule.

### 25.09.220 - Development standards for abandoned landfills

1. Regulation of Development on Abandoned Landfills. Development on abandoned landfills is subject to Seattle-King County Health Department requirements for the applicant to submit an excavation and development work plan, prepared by a licensed engineer with experience in landfill construction and/or management, and comply with other applicable requirements to prevent damage from methane gas buildup, subsidence, and earthquake induced ground shaking as contained in Chapter 22.170, Grading Code, Title 22, Subtitle I, Building Code, and regulations pertaining to development on abandoned landfill sites. Technical studies shall be required to indicate whether these areas pose a threat to development on an abandoned landfill site.
2. Areas within 1000 feet of Methane-producing Landfills. Areas within 1000 feet of methane-producing landfills may be susceptible to accumulations of hazardous levels of methane gas in enclosed spaces. Methane barriers or appropriate ventilation may be required in these areas as specified in Title 22, Subtitle I, Building Code, and Seattle-King County Health Department regulations.

### 25.09.240 - Short subdivisions and subdivisions

2. Parcels shall be divided so that each lot contains an area for the principal structure, all accessory structures, and necessary walkways and for access to this area that are outside all environmentally critical areas and buffers identified in subsection 25.09.240.A except as follows:

    1. The required area and access may be located in the footprint of an existing lawful principal structure used for residential use that encroaches into an environmentally critical area or buffer identified in subsection A, provided it does not further alter or increase the impact to the environmentally critical area or buffer.
    2. Access may be provided by a bridge over a riparian corridor when the Director determines no other access is available and (a) access is provided by a freestanding structure that maintains the natural channel and floodway of the watercourse and (b) the disturbance of the riparian corridor and any other adjacent environmentally critical area or buffer is kept to a minimum.
    3. Development may encroach into that portion of a steep slope area or its buffer for which the Director has determined that criteria in subsection 25.09.180 B2a, b, or c are met for the particular short subdivision, or subdivision under consideration.
3. Lots shall be configured to preserve the environmentally critical areas and their buffers identified in subsection A by:

    1. Establishing a separate buffer tract or lot with each owner having an undivided interest; or
    2. Establishing non-disturbance areas on individual lots.
4. The environmentally critical areas and buffers identified in subsection A above, except for areas qualifying for development under subsection B1-4, shall be designated non-disturbance areas on the final plat. A notice that these non-disturbance areas are located on the lots, including the definition of "non-disturbance area," shall recorded in the King County Office of Records and Elections along with the final plat in a form approved by the Director. At the same time, a covenant protecting non-disturbance areas shall be recorded as set out in Section 25.09.335.
5. In computing the number of lots a parcel in a single family zone may contain, the Director shall exclude the following areas:

    1. Easements and/or fee simple property used for shared vehicular access to proposed lots that are required under Section 23.53.005.
    2. The area of the environmentally critical areas and buffers identified in subsection A, unless they are on a lot that meets one of the following standards:

        1. the provisions of subsection B; or
        2. an Administrative Conditional Use is obtained under Section 25.09.260, if it is not practicable to meet the requirements of subsection B considering the parcel as a whole.
6. Application Submittal Requirements. All short subdivision and subdivision applications, in addition to the application submission requirements included in Title 23 shall meet the applicable application submittal requirements of this chapter, Section 25.09.330, and shall include the information contained in this subsection and Section 25.09.260, as applicable, on the surveyed site plan.

    1. An application for an environmentally critical areas conditional use may be submitted under either of the following circumstances:

        1. If an applicant demonstrates it is not practicable to comply with the requirements of subsection 25.09.240.B considering the parcel as a whole, the applicant may apply for an administrative conditional use permit, authorized under Section 23.42.042, under this Section 25.09.260 to allow the Director to count environmentally critical areas and their buffers that would otherwise be excluded in calculating the maximum number of lots and units allowed on the parcel under subsection 25.09.240.E.
        2. An applicant may also apply for an administrative conditional use permit to allow the Director to approve smaller than required lot sizes and yards, and/or more than one dwelling unit per lot.
    2. If an administrative conditional use application includes an application to authorize development in a critical area or buffer, then the application is not required to include an application for the variances allowed under subsections 25.09.180.E or Section 25.09.280.
2. Standards. The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposal meets the following:

    1. Environmental impacts on critical areas

        1. No development is in a riparian corridor, wetland, or wetland buffer.
        2. No riparian management area or wetland buffer is reduced.
        3. No development is on a steep slope area or its buffer unless the property being divided or, if no property is being divided, the property that is the subject of the administrative conditional use permit is predominantly characterized by steep slope areas, or unless approved by the Director under subsections 25.09.180.B.2.a, 25.09.180.B.2.b, or 25.09.180.B.2.c.

            1. The preference is to cluster units away from steep slope areas and buffers.

                1. a wetland over 1,500 square feet in size or a watercourse designated part of a riparian corridor; or
                2. an undeveloped area over 5 acres characterized by steep slopes; or
                3. areas designated by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife as urban natural open space habitat areas with significant tree cover providing valuable wildlife habitat.
        4. The proposal protects Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife priority species and maintains wildlife habitat.
        5. The open water area of a shoreline habitat, wetland or riparian corridor shall not be counted in determining the permitted number of lots.
        6. The proposal does not result in unmitigated negative environmental impacts, including drainage and water quality, erosion, and slope stability on the identified environmentally critical area and its buffer.
        7. The proposal promotes expansion, restoration or enhancement of the identified environmentally critical area and buffer.
    2. General environmental impacts and site characteristics.

        1. The proposal keeps potential negative effects of the development on the undeveloped portion of the site to a minimum and preserves topographic features.
        2. The proposal retains and protects vegetation on designated nondisturbance areas, protects stands of mature trees, keeps tree removal to a minimum, removes noxious weeds and protects the visual continuity of vegetated areas and tree canopy.
    3. Neighborhood compatibility.

        1. The total number of lots permitted on-site shall not be increased beyond that permitted by the underlying single-family zone.
        2. Where dwelling units are proposed to be attached, they do not exceed the height, bulk and other applicable development standards of the Lowrise 1 (LR1) zone.
        3. The development is reasonably compatible with and keeps the negative impact on the surrounding neighborhood to a minimum. This includes, but is not limited to, concerns such as neighborhood character, land use, design, height, bulk, scale, yards, pedestrian environment, and preservation of the tree canopy and other vegetation.
3. Conditions

    1. In authorizing an administrative conditional use, the Director shall mitigate adverse negative impacts by imposing requirements and conditions necessary to protect riparian corridors, wetlands and their buffers, and steep slope areas and their buffers, and may impose additional conditions to protect other properties in the zone or vicinity in which the property is located.
    2. In addition to any conditions imposed under subsection 25.09.260.C.1, the following conditions apply to all administrative conditional uses approved under this Section 25.09.260:

        1. Replacement and establishment of native vegetation shall be required where it is not possible to save trees or vegetation.
        2. Where new lots are created, the following standards apply:

            1. The development as a whole shall meet development standards under Title 23 and this Chapter 25.09 applicable at the time the application is vested.
            2. If new lots are created under Sections 25.09.240 and 25.09.260, development on individual lots may be nonconforming as to some or all of the development standards, except that private usable open space or private amenity areas for each dwelling unit shall be provided on the same lot as the dwelling unit it serves.
            3. Subsequent platting actions or additions or modifications to structures may not create or increase any nonconformity of the development as a whole to this Chapter 25.09, and this shall be noted on the document creating the new lots that is recorded with the Director of the King County Department of Records and Elections.
            4. Access easements and joint use and maintenance agreements shall be executed for use of common garage or parking areas, common open space, and other similar features and be recorded with the Director of the King County Department of Records and Elections.
            5. The plat documents, as recorded with the Director of the King County Department of Records and Elections, shall include a notation that each lot approved by an environmentally critical areas conditional use permit is not a separate buildable lot, and that additional development of the each individual lot may be limited as a result of the application of development standards to the original lot.
4. The Director shall issue written findings of fact and conclusions to support the Director's decision. The process and procedures for notice of decision and appeal of this administrative conditional use shall be as prescribed for Type II land use decisions in Chapter 23.76.

### 25.09.280 - Yard and setback reduction and variance to preserve ECA buffers and riparian corridor management areas.

1. The Director may authorize a twenty-five percent (25%) reduction, up to a maximum of five feet (5'), in yard or setback requirements for front or rear yards on a lot in existence as a legal building site prior to October 31, 1992, in order to maintain the full width of the riparian management area and of wetland or steep-slope area buffers.
2. The Director may approve a yard or setback reduction greater than five feet (5') in order to maintain the full width of the riparian management area, wetland buffer or steep-slope area buffer through an environmentally critical areas yard or setback reduction variance when the following facts and conditions exist:

    1. The lot has been in existence as a legal building site prior to October 31, 1992.
    2. Because of the location of the subject property in or abutting an environmentally critical area or areas and the size and extent of any required environmentally critical areas buffer, the strict application of the applicable yard or setback requirements of Title 23 would cause unnecessary hardship; and
    3. The requested variance does not go beyond the minimum to stay out of the full width of the riparian management area or required buffer and to afford relief; and
    4. The granting of the variance will not be injurious to safety or to the property or improvements in the zone or vicinity in which the property is located; and
    5. The yard or setback reduction will not result in a development that is materially detrimental to the character, design and streetscape of the surrounding neighborhood, considering such factors as height, bulk, scale, yards, pedestrian environment, and amount of vegetation remaining; and
    6. The requested variance would be consistent with the spirit and purpose of the environmentally critical policies and regulations.
3. When an environmentally critical areas variance is authorized, the Director may attach conditions regarding the location, character and other features of a proposed development to carry out the spirit and purpose of this chapter.
4. The process and procedures of an environmentally critical areas yard or setback reduction variance shall be as prescribed for Type II land use decisions in Chapter 23.76.

    1. Documentation showing that no other applicable administrative remedy in Title 25.09 or Title 23 will provide sufficient relief;
    2. Technical studies and other data that describe the possible injurious effects of the proposed development on occupiers of the land, on other properties, on public resources, and on the environment. Possible injurious effects must be described even when the injurious effect will become significant only in combination with similar effects from other developments;
    3. Technical studies and other data by qualified persons showing that the proposed development will protect the occupiers of the land, other properties, public resources, and the environment to the same extent as the development standards that are proposed to be modified and explaining how this will occur;
    4. Plans showing what can be developed in compliance with all environmentally critical area development standards and standards in Title 23, including the yard and setback standards for front and rear yards;
    5. An explanation with supporting evidence of how and why compliance with all environmentally critical areas development standards as shown on the plans required in subsection (d) would not permit any reasonable use of the property, including, but not limited to, submission of the following evidence:

        1. The date the applicant purchased the property or obtained the right to develop or use it;
        2. The price the applicant paid for the rights described in subsection (1); and
        3. Restrictions or conditions on use or development in existence when the applicant acquired the rights described in subsection (1).
    6. The Director may require the applicant to provide additional information prepared by qualified persons on the topics described in subsection B1.
    7. All technical studies and data shall be accompanied by sufficiently detailed information to allow the Director to evaluate it under the standards for scientific information set out in Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 365-195-905.
3. The Director may modify or waive an environmentally critical areas development standard and/or the yard and setback standard for front or rear yards when an applicant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that strict application of the development standards would not permit any reasonable use of the property and that development undertaken pursuant to the modified or waived standards would not cause significant injury to occupiers of the land, to other properties, and to public resources, or to the environment.
4. The Director's decision must be consistent with the scientific approach used by the City in developing the environmentally critical area development standard at issue.
5. The process and procedures for notice of decision and appeal of an environmentally critical areas exception shall be provided in the manner prescribed for Type II land use decisions in Chapter 23.76.

    1. The Director's decision shall be affirmed unless found to be clearly erroneous, and the burden of proof of justifying the environmentally critical areas exception shall be on the applicant.

2. If after investigation the Director determines that any provision of this chapter has been violated, the Director may serve a notice of violation upon any person that the Director believes is responsible for the violation. The notice of violation may identify the violation by code section; and may state what corrective action (including restoration), if any, is necessary to comply with the provisions of this chapter, set a reasonable time for compliance; and state the penalty for violating this chapter. The Director may require that the restoration plan be prepared by a qualified professional, at the violator's expense. Wetland mitigation shall be consistent with Section 25.09.160.
3. Any notice issued pursuant to subsection B shall be served upon the owner, occupier or other person responsible for the violation by personal service in the manner set forth in RCW 4.28.080 for service of a summons or sent by first class mail, addressed to the last known address of such person(s). Service is complete at the time of personal service, or if mailed, three (3) days following the date of mailing. If a notice of violation sent by first class mail is returned as undeliverable, then service of the notice upon such person or persons may be made by posting the notice at a conspicuous place on the property where the violation occurred.
4. If a notice of violation or order is recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections, a notice of violation or order for the same violation need not be served upon a new owner. If a new notice of violation or order is not issued and served upon a new owner, the Director may grant the new owner the same number of days to comply as was given the previous owner, starting on the date that the conveyance is completed.
5. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit or preclude any action or proceeding pursuant to Sections 25.09.430 and 25.09.450 of this chapter, and nothing in this section requires the Director to issue a notice of violation prior to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

### 25.09.430 - Stop-work order.

1. The Director may issue a stop-work order whenever any use, activity, work or development (1) is being done without a permit, determination, or authorization required by this Chapter 25.09, (2) is being done contrary to any determination, authorization, permit, or approval of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections and the use, activity, work or development will immediately impact an environmentally critical area or materially impair the Director's ability to secure compliance with this Chapter 25.09, or (3) immediately threatens the public health, safety, and welfare with respect to the interests protected under this Section 25.09.430.
2. The stop-work order shall describe the violation in writing and be posted on the premises or served on any person responsible for the violation. Except emergency work necessary to stabilize the site that may be required by the Director, it is unlawful for any work on the property to be done after the posting or service of a stop-work order until authorization to proceed is given by the Director.
3. The stop-work order may require that vegetation, land, watercourse, premises, building, structure, or portion thereof, be vacated within a reasonable time, depending on the degree of danger, specified in the order. No person shall occupy the vegetation, land, premises, building, structure, or portion thereof after the date on which it is required to be vacated until the vegetation, land, watercourse, premises, building, structure, or portion thereof, is restored to a safe condition as determined by the Director.

### 25.09.450 - Review by the Director.

1. Any person significantly affected by a notice of violation or stop-work order issued by the Director pursuant to this chapter may obtain an administrative review of the notice or order by requesting such review in writing to the Director within ten (10) days of the date of the notice or order. When the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or City holiday, the period shall run until five (5:00) p.m. on the next business day. A request for administrative review is an administrative remedy that must be exhausted before judicial review of the notice or order may be sought.
2. Upon receipt of the request, the Director shall notify by mail any persons served within the notice or order and any person requesting review, advising them of the request for review, of the date of the review, and of the deadline for submitting additional written information for consideration. The deadline for submitting additional written information shall be ten (10) days from the date the notice of administrative review is mailed, unless otherwise agreed to by all persons served with the notice or order. The Director and all persons served with the notice or order may also agree to review the matter within a shorter period or time that shall not be less than three (3) days from the date the notice or order was issued.
3. The Director shall conduct the administrative review and issue a decision on the request for administrative review in the form of an Order of the Director. The Director shall review all written information received by the submission deadline and any additional evidence or information available to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections staff and placed in the case file. The Director may also request clarification of information received and a site visit. After review of the case file and of the additional written information and/or after a site visit, the Director shall issue an Order of Director that may:

    1. Sustain the notice or order;
    2. Withdraw the notice or order;
    3. Continue the review to a date certain for receipt of additional information; or
    4. Modify the notice or order, which may include an extension of the compliance date, if any.
4. The Director shall issue the Order of the Director no later than ten (10) days from the deadline for submitting additional information. The Order of the Director is mailed by first class mail to the person or persons named on the notice of violation or order and to any person who requested the administrative review. If the original notice or order was recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections the Order of the Director shall also be recorded.

### 25.09.460 - Civil penalty.

1. Any person who violates or fails to comply with any provision of this chapter is subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500) per day for each violation, and in the event of a continuing violation shall be subject to a cumulative civil penalty of $500 per day for each violation from the time the violation occurs or begins until compliance is achieved. In cases where the Director has issued a notice of violation with a compliance date, the violation is deemed to begin, for purposes of determining the number of days of violation, on the date compliance is required by the notice of violation. For removing, clearing, or taking any action detrimental to a tree over six inches in caliper an additional civil penalty of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) shall be assessed.
2. Violations causing significant damage may be assessed an additional penalty in an amount reasonably determined to be equivalent to the economic benefit that the violation derived from the violation, measured as the greater of, the resulting increase in market value of the property, the value received by the violator, or the savings of construction costs realized.
3. The penalty imposed by this section may be collected by civil action brought in the name of the City. The Director notices the City Attorney in writing of the name of any person subject to the penalty, and the City Attorney, with the assistance of the Director, takes appropriate action to collect the penalty. In any civil action for a penalty, the City has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists or existed; the issuance of a notice of violation or of an Order following an administrative review by the Director is not itself evidence that a violation exists.

### 25.09.470 - Alternative criminal penalty.

Any person who violates or fails to comply with this chapter shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor subject to the provisions of Chapters 12A.02 and 12A.04, except that absolute liability shall be imposed for such a violation or failure to comply and none of the mental states described in Section 12A.04.030 need be proved. The Director may request the City Attorney prosecute such violations criminally as an alternative to the civil penalty provision outlined in this chapter. Each day that a person continues to violate or fail to comply with the provisions of this chapter and each occurrence of a prohibited activity constitutes a separate offense.


### 25.09.480 - Additional relief.

Compliance with the radiofrequency radiation standards is determined from spatial averages of power density or the mean squared electric and magnetic field strengths over a volume equivalent to the human body. The peak radiofrequency radiation levels shall not exceed twenty (20) times the allowed spatially averaged values at frequencies below three hundred (300) MHz, nor the equivalent power density of four thousand (4,000) uW/cm for frequencies between three hundred (300) MHz and six thousand (6,000) MHz, (f/1.5) uW/cm for frequencies between six thousand (6,000) MHz and thirty thousand (30,000) MHz, and twenty thousand (20,000) uW/cm at frequencies above thirty thousand (30,000) MHz. This requirement may be met by measurement of the radiofrequency radiation level along a vertical line at intervals not exceeding twenty centimeters (20 cm) over the vertical extent of an individual and calculating the average value of the readings.

    2. The effect of contributing individual sources of radiofrequency radiation within the frequency range of a broadband measuring instrument may be specified by separate measurement of these sources using a narrow-band measuring instrument. All sources in the resonant frequency range (thirty (30) MHz to three hundred (300) MHz) shall be added to show the total power density.
    3. Radiofrequency radiation measurements shall be made when radiofrequency radiation levels are expected to be highest due to operating and environmental conditions.

    5. For frequencies in the range of 0.1 to thirty (30) MHz, radiofrequency radiation levels shall be determined by measurement of both the electric and magnetic field strengths (or their squares) or the equivalent plane-wave free-space power densities associated with the electric and magnetic fields.
2. Radiofrequency radiation calculations shall be consistent with Office of Science and Technology Bulletin No. 65 of the Federal Communications Commission, or other engineering practices recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency, National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, American National Standards Institute, National Bureau of Standards or similarly qualified organization.
3. Measurements and calculations shall be certified by the person responsible for them and shall be accompanied by an explanation of the protocol, methods, equipment, and assumptions used. The certification shall include an affidavit stating the qualifications of the person responsible for the measurements and calculations. The Administrator shall approve the measurements and calculations.

## Chapter 25.11 - TREE PROTECTION

Sections:

### 25.11.010 - Purpose and intent.

It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to:


1. Implement the goals and policies of Seattle's Comprehensive Plan especially those in the Environment Element dealing with protection of the urban forest;
2. To preserve and enhance the City's physical and aesthetic character by preventing untimely and indiscriminate removal or destruction of trees;
3. To protect trees on undeveloped sites that are not undergoing development by not allowing tree removal except in hazardous situations, to prevent premature loss of trees so their retention may be considered during the development review and approval process;
4. To reward tree protection efforts by granting flexibility for certain development standards, and to promote site planning and horticultural practices that are consistent with the reasonable use of property;
5. To especially protect exceptional trees that because of their unique historical, ecological, or aesthetic value constitute an important community resource; to require flexibility in design to protect exceptional trees;
6. To provide the option of modifying development standards to protect trees over two (2) feet in diameter in the same manner that modification of development standards is required for exceptional trees;
7. To encourage retention of trees over six (6) inches in diameter through the design review and other processes for larger projects, through education concerning the value of retaining trees, and by not permitting their removal on undeveloped land prior to development permit review.

### 25.11.020 - Definitions

The Board shall issue a written decision granting, granting with conditions, or denying a certificate of approval, and shall provide a copy of its decision to the owner, the applicant, and the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, not later than 45 days after an application for a certificate of approval is determined to be complete. Notice of the Board's decision shall be provided to any person who, prior to the rendering of the decision, made a written request to receive notice of the decision or submitted written substantive comments on the application. The decision shall contain an explanation of the reasons for the Board's decision and specific findings with respect to the factors enumerated in Section 25.12.750.


#### 25.12.740 - Appeal to Hearing Examiner.

1. Any interested person of record may appeal to the Hearing Examiner the decision of the Board to grant, deny or attach conditions to a certificate of approval by serving written notice of appeal upon the Board and filing such notice and a copy of the Board's decision with the Hearing Examiner within 14 days after such grant, denial, or conditional grant.
2. When the proposed action that is the subject of the certificate of approval is also the subject of one or more related permit applications under review by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, then the appellant must also file notice of the appeal with the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, and the appeal of the certificate of approval shall not be heard until all of the time periods for filing administrative appeals on the other permits have expired, except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for the preliminary design or for subsequent design phases may proceed immediately according to Section 25.12.680 without being consolidated. If one or more appeals are filed regarding the other permits, then the appeal of the certificate of approval shall be consolidated with them and shall be heard according to the same timelines established for the other appeals, except that appeals to the State Shoreline Hearings Board shall proceed independently according to the timelines set by the state for such appeals, and except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for a preliminary design or for a subsequent design phase may proceed according to Section 25.12.680 without being consolidated. If the related permit decisions would not be appealable, then the appeal of the certificate of approval decision shall proceed immediately after it is filed.
3. The applicant for the certificate of approval may elect to have the appeal proceed immediately rather than postponed for consolidation with appeals of related permit decisions, if the applicant agrees in writing that the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections may suspend its review of the related permits, and that the time period for review of those permits shall be suspended until the Hearing Examiner issues a decision on the appeal of the certificate of approval.
4. The Hearing Examiner shall issue a decision not later than 90 days after the last of the appeals of related permit decisions is filed, or, if the applicant chooses to proceed immediately with the appeal of the certificate of approval, as provided in subsection 25.12.740.C, then not later than 90 days from the filing of that appeal. The time period to consider and decide the appeal of a certificate of approval shall be exempt from the deadlines for review and decision on both the certificate of approval and any related permit applications.

#### 25.12.750 - Factors to be considered by Board or Hearing Examiner.

In considering any application for a certificate of approval the Board, and the Hearing Examiner upon any appeal, shall take into account the following factors:


1. The extent to which the proposed alteration or significant change would adversely affect the specific features or characteristics specified in the latest of: the Board approval of nomination, the Board report on approval of designation, the stipulated agreement on controls, the Hearing Examiner's decision on controls, or the designating ordinance;
2. The reasonableness or lack thereof of the proposed alteration or significant change in light of other alternatives available to achieve the objectives of the owner and the applicant;
3. The extent to which the proposed alteration or significant change may be necessary to meet the requirements of any other law, statute, regulation, code or ordinance;
4. Where the Hearing Examiner has made a decision on controls and economic incentives, the extent to which the proposed alteration or significant change is necessary or appropriate to achieving for the owner or applicant a reasonable return on the site, improvement or object, taking into consideration the factors specified in Sections 25.12.570 through 25.12.600 and the economic consequences of denial; provided that, in considering the factors specified in Section 25.12.590 for purpose of this subsection, references to times before or after the imposition of controls shall be deemed to apply to times before or after the grant or denial of a certificate of approval; and
5. For Seattle School District property that is in use as a public school facility, educational specifications.

#### 25.12.760 - Hearing Examiner procedure.

1. When the appeal of a certificate of approval is consolidated with appeals of related permits, then the time frames applicable to the appeals of the other permits shall apply to the appeal of the certificate of approval.
2. In all other instances, the Hearing Examiner shall serve notice of the date of the hearing on the parties not less than 20 days before the hearing and shall hold a hearing not later than 45 days after the filing of the appeal. The Hearing Examiner shall issue a decision within 15 days after closing of the record, and shall serve the decision on the Board, the owner, and the applicant, and file the same with the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections. The Hearing Examiner shall receive evidence at the hearing upon the factors specified in Section 25.12.750 and in reaching a decision shall make findings on such factors.
3. If the Hearing Examiner determines that there is no showing of a significant change in circumstances since a denial or conditioning of a prior application for a similar certificate, the appeal shall be denied.
4. The Hearing Examiner's decision shall be final. Any judicial review must be commenced within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision, as provided by RCW 36.70C.040.

#### 25.12.770 - Failure of timely decision.

If the Board or Hearing Examiner fails to issue and serve a written decision upon the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, the owner, and the applicant within the times specified in this Chapter 25.12 or, if the deadlines have been extended by agreement, by the extended deadlines, then an unconditional certificate of approval shall be deemed to have been granted and the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall issue all necessary permits for the proposed alteration when all other requirements for issuance have been satisfied.


#### 25.12.835 - Demolition.

1. It is the policy of The City of Seattle to prevent the unnecessary demolition of Landmarks. Even when a certificate of approval to demolish a Landmark has been issued because its owner is unable to make reasonable economic use of the Landmark, demolition should be delayed until the owner is ready and able to proceed with a replacement use. Such delay often will be in the owner's economic interest as well as in the public interest, and a modest additional burden on an owner will be reasonable given the substantial benefit that all citizens, including the owner, derive from the presence of Landmarks within the City.
2. Unless demolition of a Landmark is ordered for reasons of health and safety by the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections pursuant to the requirements of subsection 23.40.008.B, the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections may complete all other phases of its decision-making process, and may notify the applicant that the permit is ready to be issued when the requirements of this section have been met, but the Department shall not issue a demolition permit for a landmark until:

    1. A decision under Section 25.12.730 granting a certificate of approval to demolish a Landmark has become final after the expiration of any appeal period or the conclusion of any appeal; and
    2. The Landmark has been recorded and documented to the Standards of the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) program, as administered by the National Park Service, with copies of the completed HABS documentation provided to the Library of Congress; the Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation of The State of Washington; the Seattle Public Library; and the Special Collections and Preservation Division of the University of Washington; and
    3. A Master Use Permit is ready to issue for a replacement use or structure other than a temporary use or structure or a replacement use or structure with a floor area ratio (FAR) that is not substantially less than the FAR of the landmark to be demolished; and
    4. The owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods that the owner:

        1. Has a valid and binding commitment or commitments for financing sufficient for the replacement use subject only to unsatisfied contingencies that are beyond the control of the owner other than another commitment for financing; or
        2. Has other financial resources that are sufficient (together with any valid and binding commitments for financing under subsection 25.12.835.B.4.a above) and available for such purpose.
3. Subsections B3 and B4 shall not apply if the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods that maintaining the landmark until the conditions described in subsections B3 and B4 are satisfied would be unduly burdensome and a violation of substantive due process. Among the facts the Director should consider in determining the burden on the owner are, on the one hand, the costs of maintenance until a replacement use is ready, and, on the other hand, the costs of demolition, the interest on such costs, and the costs of maintaining a vacant site.
4. The Director also may waive or modify the requirements of subsection B2 if the Director determines that compliance with this subsection would be unnecessary or inappropriate in light of the nature and value of the Landmark.
5. In making the determinations required under this section the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods is not required to hold a hearing or act as a quasi-judicial officer. The Director should consider all relevant information and should communicate with whomever the Director believes can provide useful information or expertise. The Director shall communicate his or her decision to the applicant in writing within fifteen (15) days of receiving the required information from the applicant. Pursuant to RCW 36.70B.140, the Director's decision is exempt from the time limits and other requirements of RCW 36.70B.060 through RCW 36.70B.080, and the requirements of RCW 36.70B.110 through RCW 36.70B.130.
6. An owner may seek to meet his or her burden under subsection C at the same time that the owner seeks a certificate of approval to demolish under Sections 25.12.670 through 25.12-.730. An owner also may seek to meet his or her burden under subsection C at any time after a certificate of approval to demolish has been issued.
7. There is no administrative appeal of the decision of the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods. The Director's decision shall be final. Judicial review must be commenced within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the Director's decision, as provided by RCW 36.70C.040.

An appeal of an interpretation shall be filed at the same time as appeal of the related certificate of approval, and shall be consolidated with the appeal of the related certificate of approval. Appeal of the interpretation shall proceed according to the same procedures and time frames provided in Sections 25.12.740 and 25.12.760 for appeal of a certificate of approval, including the provisions of consolidation with appeals of any related permit decisions.
7. The Hearing Examiner shall give substantial weight to the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation. The appellant shall have the burden of establishing that the interpretation is erroneous.

## Chapter 25.16 - BALLARD AVENUE LANDMARK DISTRICT

Sections:

### 25.16.010 - Legislative findings and purposes.

Throughout the City there are a few areas that retain individual identity through consistent historical or architectural character. The protection, enhancement, and perpetuation of such areas is in the interest of the prosperity, civic pride, and general welfare of the citizens of Seattle. The aesthetic standing of this City cannot be maintained or enhanced by disregarding the heritage of its communities or by allowing the destruction or defacement of these cultural assets. Ballard Avenue is an area of historical significance to the community of Ballard and The City of Seattle. The purposes for the creation of a Ballard Avenue Landmark District are:


1. To preserve, protect, enhance, and perpetuate those elements of the District's cultural, social, economic, architectural, historic, or other heritage;
2. To foster civic pride in the significance and accomplishments of the past;
3. To stabilize or improve the aesthetic and economic vitality and values of the District;
4. To promote and encourage continued private ownership and utilization of such buildings and other structures now so owned and used; and
5. To promote the local identity of the area to the extent that the objectives previously listed can be reasonably attained under such a policy.

### 25.16.020 - Legal description.

There is established the Ballard Avenue Landmark District whose boundaries are as follows:


Beginning at the intersection of the centerline of Northwest Market Street with the projection northwesterly of the southwestern margin of the alley in Block 72, Gilman Park Addition, thence southeasterly along said projection and margin to the west margin of 22nd Avenue Northwest, thence easterly across 22nd Avenue Northwest to the intersection of the east margin of 22nd Avenue Northwest and the midblock line of Block 71 Gilman Park Addition (said midblock line being that line which separates Lots 2 through 19 from Lots 21 through 37 in said Block 71), thence southeasterly along said midblock line through said Block 71 to the westerly margin of 20th Avenue Northwest, thence across 20th Avenue Northwest to the intersection of the easterly margin of 20th Avenue Northwest and the midblock line of Block 70, Gilman Park Addition (said midblock line being that line which separates Lots 2 through 8, from Lots 31 through 35 in said Block 70), thence southeasterly along said midblock line to the southernmost corner of Lot 8, Block 70, Gilman Park Addition, thence northeasterly along the southeasterly margin of said Lot 8 to the southwesterly margin of Ballard Avenue Northwest, thence easterly across Ballard Avenue Northwest to the intersection of the northeasterly margin of Ballard Avenue Northwest and the southeasterly margin of Lot 22, Block 76, Gilman Park Addition, thence northeasterly along said southeasterly margin of said Lot 22, to the easternmost corner of said Lot 22, thence northwesterly along the northeasterly margin of said Lot 22 to its intersection with southeasterly margin of Northwest Dock Place, thence across Northwest Dock Place to the intersection of northwesterly margin of Northwest Dock Place and the midblock line of Block 75, Gilman Park Addition (said midblock line being that line which separates Lots 14 through 23, from Lots 2 through 13 in said Block 75), thence northwesterly along said midblock line to the easterly margin of 20th Avenue Northwest, thence across 20th Avenue Northwest to intersection of the westerly margin of 20th Avenue Northwest and the midblock line of Block 74 Gilman Park Addition (said midblock line being that line which separates Lots 21 through 37 from Lots 2 through 19), thence northwesterly along said midblock line to the easterly margin of 22nd Avenue Northwest, thence across 22nd Avenue Northwest to the intersection of the westerly margin of 22nd Avenue Northwest and the midblock line of Block 73, Gilman Park Addition (said midblock line being that line which separates Lots 5 through 8 from Lots 1 through 3 in said Block 73), thence northwesterly along said midblock line and its northwesterly projection to the centerline of Northwest Market Street, thence westerly along said centerline to the point of beginning.

all in Seattle, King County, Washington, and illustrated on a map attached as Exhibit "A" to Ordinance 105462 which is codified at the end of this chapter; and the custodian of the Official Zoning Map of the City is directed to add said District to the Official Zoning Map. All property within said District shall be subject to the controls, procedures and standards set forth or provided for in this chapter.


### 25.16.030 - Criteria for designation of the District.

1. Ballard Avenue has significant interest and value as part of the development of Seattle. Lumber and other mills located in Ballard contributed significantly to the rebuilding of Seattle following the 1889 fire. Certain commercial buildings on Ballard Avenue dating from the same era as those lumber and shingle industries are all that remain of the early "boomtown." Ballard Avenue therefore represents the early history and heritage of the Ballard community which has contributed greatly to the development of Seattle.
2. Ballard Avenue exemplifies the historic heritage of the Ballard community. It was the location of the first commercial development in Ballard before business interests moved further north to Northwest Market Street.
3. A significant number of buildings within the Ballard Avenue Landmark District embody the distinctive characteristics of turn-of-the-century modest commercial architecture. They possess integrity of location, compatibility of design, scale, and use of materials, and impart a feeling of association and sense of place.

### 25.16.040 - Ballard Avenue Landmark District Board—Created—Membership.

            2. Four (4) sets of a plan, photograph, or elevation drawing showing the location of the proposed awning, sign, or lighting,
            3. Four (4) copies of details showing the proposed method of attaching the new awning, sign or lighting,
            4. The wattage and specifications of the proposed lighting, and a drawing or picture of the lighting fixture,
            5. One (1) sample of proposed sign colors or awning material and color;
        13. If the proposal includes demolition of a structure or object:

            1. A statement of the reason(s) for demolition,
            2. A description of the replacement structure or object;
        14. If the proposal includes replacement, removal, or demolition of existing features, a survey of the existing conditions of the features that would be replaced, removed, or demolished.
    3. The staff shall determine whether an application is complete and shall notify the applicant in writing within twenty-eight (28) days of the application being filed whether the application is complete or that the application is incomplete and what additional information is required before the application will be complete. Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the additional information, the staff shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the staff does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested.
    4. The determination of completeness does not preclude the staff or the District Board from requiring additional information during the review process if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the standards in this chapter and in any rules adopted by the Board, or if the proposed work changes. For example, additional information that may be required could include a shadow study or a traffic study when new construction is proposed.
2. An applicant may make a written request to submit an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design of a project if the applicant waives in writing the deadline for the decision on the certificate of approval for a subsequent desigin phase or phases of the project and the applicant agrees in writing that the Board decision on the preliminary design is immediately appealable by the applicant or any interested person of record. The staff may reject the request if it appears that approval of a preliminary design would not be an efficient use of staff or District Board time and resources, or would not further the goals and objectives of this chapter. To be complete, an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design must include the information listed above in subsection A2, subparagraphs a through h, i(i) through i(iii), j, m and n. A certificate of approval that is granted for a preliminary design shall be conditioned upon subsequent submittal of the final design and all of the information listed above in subsection A2, and upon obtaining a certificate of approval for final design, prior to issuance of permits for work affecting any building or property in the District.
3. If, before a certificate of approval is obtained, an application is made to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections for a permit for which a certificate of approval is required, the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall require the applicant to submit an application to the District Board for a certificate of approval. Submission of a complete application for a certificate of approval to the District Board shall be required before the permit application to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections may be deemed to be complete. The Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall continue to process such application, but shall not issue any permit until a certificate of approval has been issued pursuant to this Chapter 25.16, or the time has expired for filing with the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections the notice of denial of a certificate of approval.
4. After the Board has commenced proceedings for the consideration of any application for a certificate of approval for a particular alteration or significant change by giving notice of a meeting pursuant to this section or otherwise, no other application for the same or a similar alteration or significant change may be made until the application has been withdrawn or such proceedings and all appeals therefrom have been concluded, except than an application may be made for a certificate of approval for the preliminary design of a project and a later application made for a certificate of approval for a subsequent design phase or phases of the same project.

### 25.16.090 - Certificate of approval—Consideration by Board.

In considering such application, the District Board shall keep in mind the purpose of this chapter, the criteria specified in Section 25.16.030, and the guidelines promulgated pursuant to this chapter, and among other things, the historical and architectural value and significance; architectural style and the general design; arrangement, texture, material and color of the building or structure in question and its appurtenant fixtures, including signs; the relationship of such features to similar features of other buildings within the Ballard Avenue Landmark District; and the position of such building or structure in relation to the street or public way and to other buildings and structures.


### 25.16.100 - Certificate of approval—Issuance or denial.

1. Within 30 days after receipt of a complete application the District Board shall hold a public meeting thereon. If after such meeting and upon consideration of the foregoing, the District Board determines that the changes and any new construction proposed in the application are consistent with the purpose of this Chapter 25.16, the criteria specified in Section 25.16.030, and the guidelines promulgated pursuant to this Chapter 25.16, it shall recommend that a certificate of approval be granted and the Director shall, within 15 days of receiving the recommendation, issue a decision granting the certificate of approval in accordance with the District Board's recommendation. If the recommendation is to deny such application, the Director shall issue a written notice of denial. If the District Board does not recommend granting, granting with conditions, or denial of an application within the time provided for such recommendation, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods shall issue a decision without a recommendation from the District Board. If the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods does not issue a decision within the time provided by this Chapter 25.16, then the application shall be deemed approved. Provided, however, that the applicant may waive the deadlines in writing for the District Board to make a recommendation or the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to make a decision, if the applicant also waives in writing any deadlines on the review or issuance of related permits that are under review by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections. Before issuing a recommendation of denial, the District Board may, upon agreement with the applicant that the deadlines shall be waived, defer such action and consult with the applicant for the purpose of considering means of modifying the application and considering alternatives in keeping with the aforesaid purpose, criteria and guidelines. If at the end of an agreed upon period of time no acceptable solution has been reached, the District Board shall make its recommendation and the applicant shall be so notified by letter.
2. The Director of the Department of Neighborhoods shall send copies of the decision to the applicant, the property owner, the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections and to the District Board. Notice of the Director's decision shall be provided to any person who, prior to the rendering of the decision, made a written request to receive notice of the decision or made written substantive comments on the application.
3. A certificate of approval shall be valid for 18 months from the date of issuance of the decision granting it unless the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods grants an extension in writing; provided however, that certificates of approval for actions subject to permits issued by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall be valid for the life of the permit, including any extensions granted in writing by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections.

### 25.16.110 - Certificate of approval—Appeal if denied

1. The applicant may appeal the final denial of any such application to the Hearing Examiner within 14 days of the date of notice of the denials. When the proposed action that is the subject of the certificate of approval is also the subject of one or more related permit applications under review by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, then the appellant must also file notice of the appeal with the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, and the appeal of the certificate of approval shall not be heard until all of the time periods for filing administrative appeals on the other permits have expired, except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for the preliminary design or for subsequent design phases may proceed immediately according to Section 25.16.080 without being consolidated. If one or more appeals are filed regarding the other permits, then the appeal of the certificate of approval shall be consolidated with them and shall be heard according to the same timelines established for the other appeals, except that appeals to the State Shoreline Hearings Board shall proceed independently according to the timelines set by the state for such appeals, and except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for a preliminary design or for a subsequent design phase may proceed according to Section 25.16.080 without being consolidated. If the related permit decisions would not be appealable, then the appeal of the certificate of approval decision shall proceed immediately after it is filed.
2. The applicant for the certificate of approval may elect to have the appeal proceed immediately rather than postponed for consolidation with appeals of related permit applications, if the applicant agrees in writing that the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections may suspend its review of the related permits, and that the time period for review of those permits shall be suspended until the Hearing Examiner issues a decision on the appeal of the certificate of approval.
3. The time period to consider and decide the appeal of a certificate of approval shall be exempt from the deadlines for review and decision on both the certificate of approval and any related permit applications.
4. The Hearing Examiner after a public hearing in accordance with the procedure for hearings in contested cases in the Seattle Administrative Code, Chapter 3.02 of the Seattle Municipal Code, and in accordance with the Hearing Examiner's Rules of Practice and Procedure (unless all parties of record affected by such Board's decision consent to the review and decision without a public hearing) may affirm, reverse or modify the denial, but may reverse or modify only if the Hearing Examiner finds that:

    1. Such denial violates the terms of this chapter or guidelines adopted pursuant to the authority of this chapter; or
    2. Such denial is based upon a recommendation made in violation of the procedures set forth in this chapter or procedures adopted pursuant to the authority of this chapter and such procedural violation operates unfairly against the applicant.
5. The Hearing Examiner shall issue a decision not later than 90 days after the last of the appeals of related permit decisions is filed, or, if the applicant chooses to proceed immediately with the appeal of the certificate of approval, as provided in subsection B, then not later than 90 days from the filing of that appeal. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final. Any judicial review must be commenced within 21 days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision, as provided by RCW 36.70C.040. Copies of the decision shall be provided to all parties of record and transmitted to the Director, the District Board, and the property owner if the owner is not a party of record.

### 25.16.115 - Requests for interpretation

1. An applicant for a certificate of approval may request an interpretation of the meaning of any part of this chapter as it relates to the requested certificate of approval. An interpretation shall not have any effect on certificates of approval that have already been granted.
2. An interpretation shall be requested in writing, specify the section of the code to be interpreted, and specify the question to be addressed. Requests shall be submitted to the Historic Preservation Officer.
3. If the requested interpretation relates to a certificate of approval for which an application has been filed, then the request for an interpretation cannot be made any later than fourteen (14) days after the application for the certificate of approval was submitted. Provided, however, that a request for an interpretation may be sought by the applicant at a later time if the applicant agrees in writing to suspend the time frames for review of the certificate of approval, and the time frames applicable to any related permits that are under review, until the interpretation is issued.
4. Interpretations shall be made in writing by the Historic Preservation Officer, and shall be issued within twenty-five (25) days of submission of the request. The interpretation decision shall be provided to the requesting party, and notice of the decision shall be mailed to parties of record and interested persons of record.
5. A fee shall be charged for interpretations in the amount provided in the Permit Fee Subtitle of the Seattle Municipal Code, Chapter 22.901E, Table 6, Land Use Fees, and shall be collected by the Department of Neighborhoods.
6. An interpretation may be appealed by the applicant if the certificate of approval that the interpretation addresses is denied and the applicant is appealing the denial, or if the interpretation relates to conditions placed on the certificate of approval that the applicant is appealing. An appeal of an interpretation shall be filed at the same time as appeal of the related certificate of approval, and shall be consolidated with the appeal of the related certificate of approval. Appeal of the interpretation shall proceed according to the same procedures and time frames provided in Section 25.16.110 for appeal of a certificate of approval, including the provisions for consolidation with appeals of any related permit decisions.
7. The Hearing Examiner shall give substantial weight to the Historic Preservation Officer's decision. The appellant shall have the burden of establishing that the interpretation is erroneous.
8. The Hearing Examiner may affirm, reverse, or modify the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation, in whole or in part. The Hearing Examiner may also remand the interpretation to the Historic Preservation Officer for further consideration.
9. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final. The Hearing Examiner's decision shall be binding upon the Historic Preservation Officer and the Board, as well as all parties of record to the proceeding. Copies of the Hearing Examiner's decision shall be provided to the Historic Preservation Officer and to all parties of record before the Hearing Examiner. Judicial review must be commenced within 21 days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision, as provided by RCW 36.70C.040.

### 25.16.120 - Development and design review guidelines.

1. The District Board shall draft, and after consideration and review at least one (1) public hearing shall adopt development and design review guidelines and amendments thereof, which shall become effective upon filing with the City Clerk. Notice of such public hearings shall be given in accordance with rules adopted by the District Board.
2. The development and design review guidelines shall identify the unique values of the District, shall include a statement of purpose and intent, and shall be consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the criteria specified in Section 25.16.030. The guidelines shall identify design characteristics which have either a positive or negative effect upon such unique values of the District and shall specify the materials, colors, signage, planting and other design-related considerations which will be allowed, encouraged, limited, or excluded from the District. If such design considerations are limited, the guidelines shall state either the reasons for such limitation or conditions under which such considerations will be permitted.

### 25.16.130 - Advice and guidance to property owners.

The District Board may, at its official meetings upon request of a District property owner or business tenant, render advice and guidance with respect to any proposed work within the District.


### 25.16.140 - Enforcement and penalties.

The Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall enforce this Chapter 25.16 and anyone violating or failing to comply with its provisions shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined in any sum not exceeding $500. Each day's violation or failure to comply shall constitute a separate offense.


### 25.16.150 - Conflicting provisions.

In case of conflict between this chapter and the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance (Ordinance 102229), the provisions of this chapter shall govern the Ballard Avenue Landmark District.

2. To foster community and civic pride in the significance and accomplishments of the past;
3. To stabilize or improve the historic authenticity, economic vitality, and aesthetic value of the district;
4. To promote and encourage continued private ownership and use of buildings and other structures;
5. To ensure compliance with the District plan prepared in the spring of 1978 by The Richardson Associates;
6. To encourage continued City interest and support in the District; and
7. To promote the local identity of the area.

### 25.20.030 - Legal description.

All property within the District shall be subject to the controls, procedures, and standards set forth or provided for in this chapter, whether publicly or privately owned.


### 25.20.040 - Criteria for designation of the District.

1. Historical. Columbia City has significance and value as part of the development of Seattle. Its early growth, like that of Seattle, Ballard and other Puget Sound settlements, was as a pioneer mill town. But while Seattle grew and remained dominant in the region, because of its harbor, and later the railroads, Columbia City developed less dramatically only to be annexed by Seattle after fourteen (14) years as an incorporated town. Nonetheless, Columbia City retained its identity even following annexation, and to this day remains a distinct and historic part of Greater Seattle. Columbia City as a separate municipality contributed to the historic growth of the Seattle Area from the time of its incorporation in 1893 until its annexation in 1907, growing with logging and railroad development. When the Seattle, Renton and Southern Railways stretched the seven (7) miles from Seattle to Columbia City in 1890 it claimed a lucrative two-way freight business. Columbia City shipped surplus lumber to a rebuilding Seattle (after 1889 fire) and Columbia City needed the finished goods Seattle could provide. Much of Columbia City's lumber, as well as the goods from Seattle, went into its own buildings and lakeshore summer residences. Remote Columbia City, thanks to nearby Lake Washington and Wetmore Slough, was a busy summer escape for the neighboring city's residents. Until the lowering of Lake Washington with the cutting of the Ship Canal, Wetmore Slough had been considered by Columbia City as its port to the sea.
2. Sociological. The District is associated with the lives of many of the region's pioneers through business, transportation and commercial activities and general pioneering efforts that were concentrated in the area.
3. Architectural. A significant number of buildings within the Columbia City Landmark District embody distinctive characteristics of turn-of-the-century modest commercial and residential architecture. They possess integrity of location, compatibility of design, scale, and use of materials, and impart a sense of historic continuity, a feeling of association and a sense of place. The area is significant for landmark designation not only because of its buildings, but especially because of the total quality of an earlier small town: a pleasant admixture of commercial buildings, churches, apartments and houses, and within its core a small and integral park.

### 25.20.050 - Administration.

Jurisdiction over changes and improvements in the District is vested in the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board. In order, however, to maintain adequate community involvement and contact, an Application Review Committee is created which shall consist of two (2) members of the Landmarks Board appointed by the Chairman, at least one (1) of whom shall be an architect, and three (3) members of the Columbia City Development Association, appointed by the President of that organization, to review all proposed changes to public and private property and to make recommendations to the Landmarks Board for issuance or denial of certificates of approval. The two (2) Board Members of the Committee shall be appointed for renewable two (2) year terms, and the Association Members shall also be appointed for two (2) year renewable terms, but appointments shall be staggered with one (1) member of each group initially appointed for one (1) year only.


### 25.20.060 - Development and design review guidelines.

1. The Landmarks Preservation Board shall draft and, after consideration and review at no less than one (1) public hearing, shall adopt development and design review guidelines and amendments which shall become effective upon filing with the City Clerk; these guidelines shall include at least by reference the Columbia City Business District Plan prepared by The Richardson Associates for guidance in reviewing public properties and new developments. Notice and conduct of such public hearing(s) shall be in accordance with rules adopted by the Landmarks Preservation Board.
2. The development and design review guidelines shall identify the unique values of the District, shall include a statement of purpose and intent, and shall be consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the criteria specified in Section 25.20.030. The guidelines shall identify design characteristics which have either a positive or negative effect upon the unique values of the District and shall specify the materials, colors, signage, planting, and other design-related considerations which will be allowed, encouraged, limited or excluded from the District.

### 25.20.070 - Approval of changes to buildings, structures and other property.

No person shall make any change, including but not limited to alteration, demolition, construction, reconstruction, restoration, remodeling, and changes involving painting or signs, (but excluding in-kind maintenance and repairs which do not affect the appearance of the structure(s)) to the exterior of any building or structure in the District, or to the external appearance of any other property or public right-of-way in the District which is visible from a public street, alley, way, or other public property, nor construct any new building or structure in the District without first securing a certificate of approval from the Landmarks Preservation Board. No City building permit or other permit for alterations or new construction shall be issued until the Landmarks Preservation Board has granted a certificate of approval for the proposed activity.


### 25.20.080 - Application for certificate of approval.

1. Application.

    1. Application for a certificate of approval may be made by filing an application for such a certificate with the Board.

            3. Any new construction;

                1. Four (4) sets of scale drawings, with all dimensions shown, of:
            4. A site plan of existing conditions, showing adjacent streets and buildings, and, if the proposal includes any work in the public right-of-way, the existing street uses, such as street trees and sidewalk displays, and another site plan showing proposed changes to the existing conditions,
            5. A floor plan showing the existing features and a floor plan showing the proposed new features,

        11. If the proposal includes new signage, awnings, or exterior lighting:

            1. Four (4) sets of scale drawings of proposed signage or awnings, showing the overall dimensions, material, design graphics, typeface, letter size, and colors,
            2. Four (4) sets of a plan, photograph, or elevation drawing showing the location of the proposed awning, sign, or lighting,
            3. Four (4) copies of details showing the proposed method of attaching the new awning, sign, or lighting,
            4. The wattage and specifications of the proposed lighting, and a drawing or picture of the lighting fixture,
            5. One (1) sample of proposed sign colors or awning material and color;

        13. If the proposal includes replacement, removal, or demolition of existing features, a survey of the existing conditions of the features that would be replaced, removed, or demolished.
    3. The staff shall determine whether an application is complete and shall notify the applicant in writing within twenty-eight (28) days of the application being filed whether the application is complete or that the application is incomplete and what additional information is required before the application will be complete. Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the additional information, the staff shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the staff does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested.
    4. The determination of completeness does not preclude the staff or the Board from requiring additional information during the review process if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the criteria in this chapter and in any rules adopted by the Board, or if the proposed work changes. For example, additional information that may be required could include a shadow study or a traffic study when new construction is proposed.
2. An applicant may make a written request to submit an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design of a project if the applicant waives in writing the deadline for a Board decision on the subsequent design phase or phases of the project and any deadlines for decisions on related permit applications under review by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections and the applicant agrees in writing that the Board decision on the preliminary design is immediately appealable by the applicant or any interested person of record. The staff may reject the request if it appears that approval of a preliminary design would not be an efficient use of staff or Board time and resources, or would not further the goals and objectives of this Chapter 25.20. To be complete, an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design must include the information listed above in subsection 25.20.080.A.2, subparagraphs a through h, i(1) through i(3), j, m and n. A certificate of approval that is granted for a preliminary design shall be conditioned upon subsequent submittal of the final design and all of the information listed above in subsection 25.20.080.A.2, and upon Board approval, prior to issuance of permits for work affecting any building or property in the District.
3. If before a certificate of approval is obtained, an application is made to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections for a permit for which a certificate of approval is required, the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall require the applicant to submit an application to the Board for a certificate of approval. Submission of a complete application for a certificate of approval to the Board shall be required before the permit application to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections may be deemed to be complete. The Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall continue to process such application, but shall not issue any permit until a certificate of approval has been issued pursuant to this Chapter 25.20, or the time has expired for filing with the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections the notice of denial of a certificate of approval.
4. After the Board has commenced proceedings for the consideration of any application for a certificate of approval for a particular alteration or significant change, by giving notice of a meeting pursuant to this section or otherwise, no other application for the same or a similar alteration or significant change may be made until the application is withdrawn or such proceedings and all appeals therefrom have been concluded, except that an application may be made for a certificate of approval for the preliminary design of a project and a later application for a certificate of approval for a subsequent design phase or phases of the same project.

### 25.20.090 - Board meeting on certificate of approval.

1. Within thirty (30) days after the filing of an application for a certificate of approval with the Board, the Board shall hold a meeting thereon and shall serve notice of the meeting on the owner and the applicant not less than five (5) days before the date of the meeting.
2. In reviewing applications, the Application Review Committee and the Landmarks Preservation Board and the Hearing Examiner shall consider: (1) the purposes of this chapter; (2) the criteria specified in Section 25.20.040; (3) any guidelines promulgated pursuant to this chapter; (4) the properties' historical and architectural value and significance; (5) the properties' architectural style and general design; (6) the arrangement, texture, material and color of the building or structure in question, and its appurtenant fixtures, including signs; (7) the relationship of such features to similar features of other buildings within the Columbia City Landmark District; and (8) the position of such buildings or structures in relation to the street or public way and to other buildings and structures.

### 25.20.100 - Issuance of Board decision.

1. The Board shall issue a written decision either granting or denying a certificate of approval or granting it with conditions not later than 45 days after the application for a certificate of approval is determined to be complete and shall serve a copy thereof upon the owner, the applicant and the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections within three working days after such grant or denial. Notice of the Board's decision shall be provided to any person who, prior to the rendering of the decision, made a written request to receive notice of the decision or submitted written substantive comments on the application. A decision denying a certificate of approval shall contain an explanation of the reasons for the Board's decision and specific findings with respect to this Chapter 25.20 and adopted guidelines for the District.
2. A certificate of approval shall be valid for 18 months from the date of issuance of the Board's decision granting it unless the Board grants an extension in writing; provided however, that certificates of approval for actions subject to permits issued by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall be valid for the life of the permit, including any extensions granted in writing by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections.

### 25.20.110 - Appeal to Hearing Examiner.

1. Any interested person of record may appeal to the Hearing Examiner the decision of the Board to grant, deny or attach conditions to a certificate of approval by serving written notice of appeal upon the Board and filing such notice and a copy of the Board's decision with the Hearing Examiner within fourteen (14) days after such grant, denial or conditional grant.
2. When the proposed action that is the subject of the certificate of approval is also the subject of one or more related permit applications under review by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, then the appellant must also file notice of the appeal with the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, and the appeal of the certificate of approval shall not be heard until all of the time periods for filing administrative appeals on the other permits have expired, except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for the preliminary design or for subsequent design phases may proceed immediately according to Section 25.20.080 without being consolidated. If one or more appeals are filed regarding the other permits then the appeal of the certificate of approval shall be consolidated with them and shall be heard according to the same timelines established for the other appeals, except that appeals to the State Shoreline Hearings Board shall proceed independently according to the timelines set by the state for such appeals, and except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for a preliminary design or for a subsequent design phase may proceed according to Section 25.20.080 without being consolidated. If the related permit decisions would not be appealable, then the appeal of the certificate of approval decision shall proceed immediately after it is filed.
3. The applicant for the certificate of approval may elect to have the appeal proceed immediately rather than postponed for consolidation with appeals of related permit applications, if the applicant agrees in writing that the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections may suspend its review of the related permits, and that the time period for review of those permits shall be suspended until the Hearing Examiner issues a decision on the appeal of the certificate of approval.
4. The Hearing Examiner shall issue a decision not later than ninety (90) days after the last of the appeals of related permit decisions is filed, or, if the applicant chooses to proceed immediately with the appeal of the certificate of approval, as provided in subsection C, then not later than ninety (90) days from the filing of that appeal. The time period to consider and decide the appeal of a certificate of approval shall be exempt from the deadlines for review and decision on both the certificate of approval and any related permit applications.
5. The Hearing Examiner shall hear and determine the appeal in accordance with the standards and procedures established for appeals to the Hearing Examiner under Sections 25.12.740 through 25.12.770 of this Code.
6. The Hearing Examiner's decision shall be final. Any judicial review must be commenced within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision, as provided by RCW 36.70C.040.

### 25.20.115 - Requests for interpretation

1. An applicant for a certificate of approval may request an interpretation of the meaning of any part of this chapter as it relates to the requested certificate of approval. An interpretation shall not have any effect on certificates of approval that have already been granted.
2. An interpretation shall be requested in writing, specify the section of the code to be interpreted, and specify the question to be addressed. Requests shall be submitted to the Historic Preservation Officer.
3. If the requested interpretation relates to a certificate of approval for which an application has been filed, then the request for an interpretation cannot be made any later than fourteen (14) days after the application for the certificate of approval was submitted. Provided, however, that a request for an interpretation may be sought by the applicant at a later time if the applicant agrees in writing to suspend the time frames for review of the certificate of approval, and the time frames applicable to any related permits that are under review, until the interpretation is issued.
4. Interpretations shall be made in writing by the Historic Preservation Officer, and shall be issued within twenty-five (25) days of submission of the request. The interpretation decision shall be served on the requesting party, and notice of the decision shall be mailed to parties of record and interested persons of record.
5. A fee shall be charged for interpretations in the amount provided in the Permit Fee Subtitle of the Seattle Municipal Code, Chapter 22.901E, Table 6, Land Use Fees, and shall be collected by the Department of Neighborhoods.
6. An interpretation may be appealed by the applicant if the certificate of approval that the interpretation addresses is denied and the applicant is appealing the denial, or if the interpretation relates to conditions placed on the certificate of approval that the applicant is appealing. An appeal of an interpretation shall be filed at the same time as appeal of the related certificate of approval, and shall be consolidated with the appeal of the related certificate of approval. Appeal of the interpretation shall proceed according to the same procedures and time frames provided in Section 25.20.110 for appeal of a certificate of approval, including the provisions for consolidation with appeals of any related permit decisions.
7. The Hearing Examiner shall give substantial weight to the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation. The appellant shall have the burden of establishing that the interpretation is erroneous.
8. The Hearing Examiner may affirm, reverse, or modify the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation, in whole or in part. The Hearing Examiner may also remand the interpretation to the Historic Preservation Officer for further consideration.
9. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final. The Hearing Examiner's decision shall be binding upon the Historic Preservation Officer and the Board, as well as all parties of record to the proceeding. Copies of the Hearing Examiner's decision shall be provided to the Historic Preservation Officer and to all parties of record before the Hearing Examiner. Judicial review must be commenced within 21 days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision, as provided by RCW 36.70C.040.

### 25.20.120 - Enforcement and penalties.

The Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall enforce this Chapter 25.20 and anyone violating or failing to comply with its provisions shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined in any sum not exceeding $500.

### 25.21.034 - Criteria for District designation.

The Fort Lawton Historic District is significant for its association with the development and the history of the City of Seattle and for its embodiment of the characteristics of military interpretations of American architectural styles of the 1890s and early 1900s, based on standard Quartermaster General building designs, as well as its planned site. The period of significance for the Fort Lawton Historic District is from 1898 to 1945, based on the development of the post, with additional buildings and site features resulting from the Depression-era public works, and the fort's role in World War II.


### 25.21.040 - Design review guidelines.

1. The Landmarks Preservation Board shall draft and, after consideration and review in accordance with SMC 3.02, shall adopt design review guidelines as rules which shall become effective upon filing with the City Clerk. Notice and conduct of such public hearing(s) shall be in accordance with the rules of the Landmarks Preservation Board and SMC 3.02.
2. The design review guidelines shall identify the unique values of the District, shall include a statement of purpose and intent, and shall be consistent with the purposes of this chapter. The guidelines shall identify design characteristics which have either a positive or negative effect upon the unique values of the District and shall specify design-related considerations which will be allowed, encouraged, limited or excluded from the District when certificate of approval applications are reviewed.
3. Until the Board adopts guidelines pursuant to subsection A, the Landmarks Preservation Board shall review any application for a certificate of approval using the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Properties.

### 25.21.050 - District Administration.

Jurisdiction over changes and improvements to the District is vested in the Board. However in order to maintain adequate community involvement and contact, an Application Review Committee is created which shall consist of five (5) members, two (2) members of the Landmarks Preservation Board, at least one (1) of whom shall be an architect, two (2) members. one selected from District property owners and/or residents and one selected from representatives of organizations that have a demonstrated interest in the history and preservation of the Fort Lawton Landmark District, and one (1) member recommended by the Superintendent of Parks.

The members of the committee shall be appointed annually by the Chair of the Board. The committee shall review and make recommendations to the Board for issuance or denial of applications for certificates of approval within the District.


### 25.21.054 - Relationship between Landmark Board review and responsibilities of other City departments

The function of the Landmarks Board under Section 25.21.060 is to review public or private applications for certificates of approval to demolish, alter, or construct buildings, structures, and site elements located within the District, for consistency with the landmarks criteria prescribed in Section 25.21.110. It is not the function of the Landmarks Board to regulate the use of property within the District, which is the responsibility of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, or to manage the use of City owned property within the District, which is the responsibility of the Department of Parks and Recreation.

Privately owned properties located in the Landmark District are not located in Discovery Park, and therefore are not subject to the Discovery Park Long Range Development Plan or to the authority of the Department of Parks and Recreation.

City owned properties located in the Landmark District are within the boundaries of Discovery Park and their management and use shall be consistent with the Discovery Park Long Range Development Plan. The Superintendent of Parks, with the advice of the Seattle Board of Park Commissioners, is the principal authority in matters relating to implementation of the Discovery Park Long-Range Development Plan, including City-owned properties within the Landmark District. The Superintendent of Parks has the primary responsibility for managing and maintaining these properties within the District, subject to the authority of the Landmarks Board as described in this Chapter 25.21. Therefore, all matters affecting the use and operation of these City-owned properties shall be approved by the Superintendent of Parks with advice from the Board of Park Commissioners.


### 25.21.060 - Approval of significant changes to buildings, structures and other property.

Within the District, a certificate of approval, issued by the Landmarks Preservation Board, is required prior to the issuance of any City building, demolition, street use, or other permits for proposed work which work is within or visible from public property and, which involves:


1. The demolition of, or exterior alterations or additions to, any building or structure;
2. Any new construction;
3. The addition or removal of major landscape and site elements, such as retaining walls, gateways, trees or driveways.
In addition, for proposed removal or addition of significant landscape and site elements which are within or visible from public property but for which permits are not required, and which are identified specifically in the District development and design review guidelines, a certificate of approval from the Board is also required prior to the initiation of the proposed work.


### 25.21.080 - Application for certificate of approval.

1. Application.

    1. Application for a certificate of approval may be made by filing an application for such a certificate with the Board.

        14. If the proposal includes replacement, removal, or demolition of existing features, a survey of the existing conditions of the features that would be replaced, removed, or demolished.
    3. The staff shall determine whether an application is complete and shall notify the applicant in writing within twenty-eight (28) days of the application being filed whether the application is complete or that the application is incomplete and what additional information is required before the application will be complete. Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the additional information, the staff shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the staff does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested.
    4. The determination of completeness does not preclude the staff or the Board from requiring additional information during the review process if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the criteria in this chapter and in any rules adopted by the Board, or if the proposed work changes. For example, additional information that may be required could include a shadow study or a traffic study when new construction is proposed.
2. An applicant may make a written request to submit an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design of a project, if the applicant waives in writing the deadline for a Board decision on the subsequent design phase or phases of the project and the applicant agrees in writing that the Board decision on the preliminary design is immediately appealable by the applicant or any interested person of record. The staff may reject the request if it appears that approval of a preliminary design would not be an efficient use of staff or Board time and resources, or would not further the goals and objectives of this chapter. To be complete, an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design must include the information listed above in subsection A2, subparagraphs a through h, i(1) through i(3), j, m and n. A certificate of approval that is granted for a preliminary design shall be conditioned upon subsequent submittal of the final design and all of the information listed above in subsection A2, and upon Board approval, prior to issuance of permits for work affecting any building or property in the District.
3. If an application is made to the Director for a permit for which a certificate of approval is required, the Director shall require the applicant to submit an application to the Board for a certificate of approval. Submission of a complete application for a certificate of approval to the Board shall be required before the permit application to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections may be determined to be complete. The Director shall continue to process the application, but shall not issue any permit until a certificate of approval has been issued pursuant to this Chapter 25.21, or the time for filing the notice of denial of a certificate of approval with the Director has expired.
4. After the Board has commenced proceedings for the consideration of any application for a certificate of approval for a particular alteration or significant change by giving notice of a meeting pursuant to this section or otherwise, no other application for the same or a similar alteration or significant change at the same site may be made until the application is withdrawn or such proceedings and all appeals therefrom have been concluded, except that an application may be made for a certificate of approval for the preliminary design of a project and a later application may be made for a certificate of approval for subsequent design phase or phases of the same project.
5. A certificate of approval shall be valid for 18 months from the date of issuance of the Board's decision granting it unless the Board grants an extension in writing; provided however, that certificates of approval for actions subject to permits issued by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall be valid for the life of the permit, including any extensions granted in writing by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections.

### 25.21.110 - Board meeting on certificate of approval.

### 25.21.120 - Issuance of Board decision.

The Board shall consider the recommendation of the Application Review Committee and shall, within forty-five (45) days after the application for a certificate of approval is determined to be complete, issue a written decision either granting, granting with conditions, or denying a certificate of approval and shall mail a copy of the decision to the owner, the applicant and the Director within three (3) working days after such decision.

An appeal of an interpretation shall be filed at the same time as appeal of the related certificate of approval, and shall be consolidated with the appeal of the related certificate of approval. Appeal of the interpretation shall proceed according to the same procedures and time frames provided in Section 25.21.130 for appeal of a certificate of approval, including the provisions for consolidation with appeals of any related permit decisions.
7. The Hearing Examiner shall give substantial weight to the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation. The appellant shall have the burden of establishing that the interpretation is erroneous.
8. The Hearing Examiner may affirm, reverse, or modify the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation, in whole or in part. The Hearing Examiner may also remand the interpretation to the Historic Preservation Officer for further consideration.
9. The decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be final.

## Chapter 25.22 - HARVARD-BELMONT LANDMARK DISTRICT

Sections:

### 25.22.010 - Legislative findings and purposes.

Throughout the City there are few areas that have retained individual identity, historical continuity or consistency of architectural character.

The Harvard-Belmont Landmark District, situated on the west slope of Capitol Hill above the City's major freeway and representing gracious residential quality in the urban setting, is one such area. The character of the district is defined by a substantial, well-established, and well-maintained residential fabric encompassing both large estates and modest houses, a mix of urban cultural and commercial institutions, within a framework of tree-lined streets, well-maintained grounds, and distinctive natural features.

The topography of the area is typical of those where the first outlying neighborhoods of quality residences were established in Seattle during a decade of rapid growth just after the turn of the century. From the relatively flat eastern boundaries of Broadway East and Harvard Avenue East the land slopes gradually and then more precipitously downward to the west, providing many of the properties with dramatic sites affording views of Lake Union and Queen Anne Hill. The northern boundary is marked by a deep wooded ravine separating the Sam Hill House from the properties around St. Mark's Cathedral. The southern boundary at East Roy Street changes to apartment, institutional, and commercial use and marks the transition to the denser multiple-unit residential area and the commercial shopping strip of Broadway East to the south. Within these boundaries the normally overriding grid system of platting gives way to some diagonal and curving streets that generally conform to the natural contours of the land.

H. C. Henry, a railroad builder and a powerful force in Seattle's business community, was the first man of influence to settle in the district. Although his house is now gone, his presence was instrumental in attracting others of like means and ability to the area. During the first decade of the twentieth century merchants, bankers, lawyers, engineers, and then lumber barons, successful businessmen and entrepreneurs built impressive residences along Harvard Avenue East, Belmont Place East and neighboring streets.

In the next two decades some additional large houses were built and some of the existing mansions were sold to equally affluent buyers.

Although many architectural styles are represented in the district, among the buildings of primary significance are a substantial number of residences which exhibit the enduring influence of Richard Norman Shaw. These Shavian houses impart a special quality to the area, a distinctive element which can be found in northern Pacific coast cities (Victoria and Vancouver, B.C., Seattle, Portland). The two Fisher houses on Belmont Place East together with their garage below on Summit Avenue East form a distinctive group of brick and half-timbered dwellings with fine leaded and beveled glass. The M. H. Young House, the C. H. Bacon House, the J. A. Kerr House, and the W. L. Rhodes House are additional examples of the use of brick and half-timbering to evoke the spirit of a romantic medievalism as filtered through the precepts of Shaw.

Other residences display the symmetry of a more classical tradition. The restrained formality of the R. D. Merrill House, the imposing mass of the Chapin-Eddy House relieved by delicate ornamentation, and the strong simple statement of the Brownell-Bloedel House all contribute a sense of solidity and permanence to the district.

Sometimes architects outside the City, such as Charles Al Platte, Hornblower & Marshall, Cutter & Malmgren, and Arthur Bodely, were called upon to satisfy a client's particular wishes. More often local firms with established reputations were commissioned, and works by Carl F. Gould, Somerwell & Cote, Bebb & Mendel, the Beezer Brothers, James H. Schack, Graham & Myers, Blackwell & Baker, and Andrew Willatsen can be found in the district. Interspersed among the mansions of the wealthy bankers, shipbuilders, lumbermen, and merchants are numerous wood frame houses of more modest scale. A few of these were built before 1900, many date from the first decade of the twentieth century, and there are a number of simple residences from the late 1930's and early 1940's.

The 1920's brought the introduction of the Spanish style Hacienda Apartments, the Tudor influenced Anhalt apartment groups, as well as the Cornish School and the Woman's Century Club. These structures, concentrated along the southern and western boundaries of the District, are particularly representative of the Capitol Hill character where a rich mix of architecture, and a successful mix of residential and commercial uses, exists.

The protection, enhancement and perpetuation of the Harvard-Belmont District is in the interests of the prosperity, civic pride, urban and visual quality, and general welfare of the citizens of Seattle.

The cultural standing of this City cannot be maintained or enhanced by disregarding the history of its communities or by allowing the destruction or defacement of its heritage. The Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board has identified the Harvard/Belmont area as one of these few remaining areas reflecting, in its architectural and landscape elements, its historical origins significant in the development of Capitol Hill and, therefore, Seattle.

The purposes for the creation of the Harvard-Belmont Landmark District are:


1. To preserve, protect, enhance, and perpetuate those elements of the District's cultural, social, economic, architectural, and historic heritage;
2. To foster community and civic pride in the significance and accomplishments of the past;
3. To stabilize or improve the historic authenticity, economic vitality, and aesthetic value of the district;
4. To promote and encourage continued private ownership and use of buildings and other structures;
5. To encourage continued City interest and support in the District; and to recognize and promote the local identity of the area.

### 25.22.040 - Historical criteria for District designation.

The history of Seattle and of its neighborhoods is a history of the destruction and reshaping of forested virgin lands for economic returns; the filling of tide flats and the cutting of new waterways for industry and commerce; the clearcutting of native forests by pioneer lumber barons; and the regrading of the natural topography to an extent seldom before or since practiced in an American city.

Neighborhoods such as Harvard-Belmont, which today have the appearance of heavily wooded retreats, were created from the wasteland left by the lumbering industry. Mansions were built on treeless lots, and landscaping, shrubs, and seeds were left to the graces of the climate and the fertile soil.

Within the first two decades of this century, the District was home to Samuel Hill (railroads), C. H. Bacon (building materials), J. H. Bloedel, and R. D. Merril (lumbering), C. J. Smith (banking), Dexter Horton (bank president), O. W. Fisher (flour mills), and John Eddy (lumbering and shipbuilding), among others. Queen Marie of Rumania, her children Prince Nicholas and Princess Ileeana, Marshall Joffre of France, and Grand Duchess Marie of Russia, were among the many distinguished foreign guests to the district.

A number of central Seattle residential areas have felt the effects of the move to the suburbs, changing populations, changes in use and zoning and deteriorating services. The Harvard-Belmont district, however, has maintained its identity, character, and quality to a degree which permits its continuance as a prestigious, liveable and highly desirable neighborhood in which to live.


### 25.22.050 - Sociological criteria for District designation.

Much of the area known today as Capitol Hill was laid out and developed by realtor J. A. Moore. He opened the area north of Howell Street to homeowners in 1901, naming it after Capitol Hill in Denver. The area, even then, had enormous advantages as a new residential district because of its closeness to the business district, its prominent siting and its spectacular views. As a result, and in addition to a sprinkling of existing farm or country houses, many magnificent homes were built on the hill from 1901 until the Great Depression. In the Harvard-Belmont area of Capitol Hill, most of these older and impressive homes are still extant and interspersed with them are good examples of more modest residential architecture representative of every decade of this century (to date). Included in the District also are several of the Anhalt apartment houses, precursors of planned group living, including carefully maintained yards, romantic details, and garaging for automobiles; the main building of Cornish Institute, one of the more significant cultural-historical landmarks in the City; the Loveless apartment-retail building; the Harvard Exit Theatre, for many years the home of the Woman's Century Club; and the Rainier Chapter of the D.A.R., a careful replica of George Washington's home, Mt. Vernon. This mixture of function, uses, scale and economics is among the more interesting aspects of the area. Moreover, the combination of urban and almost pastoral qualities, the tree-shaded streets, the several open vistas, and the wooded ravines to the northwest, all create a neighborhood of outstanding and enduring character.


### 25.22.060 - Architectural criteria for District designation.

The Harvard-Belmont District includes a rich variety of residential buildings in the prevailing eclectic styles of the earlier years of this century, combined with a few late Victorian residences, significant Spanish and Tudor apartment groups, the modified Spanish style of the Cornish Institute, and many modest, noneclectic houses. Uniting this variety of architectural expression are the tree-lined streets, the many walled yards and drives, interesting retaining walls and generous plantings all of which collectively create a backdrop and contiguous streetscape and neighborhood that are compatible in terms of design, scale and use of materials.


### 25.22.070 - Development and design review guidelines.

1. The Landmarks Preservation Board shall draft and, after consideration and review in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Ordinance (102228)1 shall adopt development and design review guidelines as rules which shall become effective upon filing with the City Clerk. Notice and conduct of such public hearing(s) shall be in accordance with the rules of the Landmarks Preservation Board and Ordinance 102228.
2. The development and design review guidelines shall identify the unique values of the District, shall include a statement of purpose and intent, and shall be consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the criteria specified in Section 25.22.030. The guidelines shall identify design characteristics which have either a positive or negative effect upon the unique values of the District and shall specify design-related considerations which will be allowed, encouraged, limited or excluded from the District when certificate of approval applications are reviewed. All guidelines shall be consistent with the Zoning Ordinance (86300) and other applicable ordinances.

### 25.22.080 - District administration.

Jurisdiction over changes and improvements in the District is vested in the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board. In order, however, to maintain adequate community involvement and contact, an Application Review Committee is created which shall consist of two (2) members of the Landmarks Board, at least one (1) of whom shall be an architect, and three (3) members selected from property owners, residents, business owners or employees, or officers of institutions within the District boundaries.

The members of the committee shall be appointed annually by the Chairman of the Landmarks Board with the approval of the Landmarks Board. The Committee shall review and make recommendations to the Landmarks Board for issuance or denial of applications for certificates of approval within the District.


### 25.22.090 - Approval of significant changes to buildings, structures and other property.

Within the District, a certificate of approval, issued by the Landmarks Preservation Board, is required prior to the issuance of any City building, demolition, street use, or other permits for proposed work which work is within or visible from a public street, alley or way, and, which involves:


1. The demolition of, or exterior alterations or additions to, any building or structure;
2. Any new construction;
3. The addition or removal of major landscape and site elements, such as retaining walls, gateways, trees or driveways. In addition, for proposed removal or addition of significant landscape and site elements for which permits are not required, and which are identified specifically in the District development and design review guidelines, a certificate of approval from the Landmarks Preservation Board shall also be required prior to the initiation of the proposed work.

### 25.22.100 - Application for certificate of approval.

1. Application.

    1. Application for a certificate of approval may be made by filing an application for such a certificate with the Board.

            3. Any new construction;
        9. Four (4) sets of scale drawings, with all dimensions shown, of:

            1. A site plan of existing conditions, showing adjacent streets and buildings, and, if the proposal includes any work in the public right-of-way, the existing street uses, such as street trees and sidewalk displays, and another site plan showing proposed changes to the existing conditions,
            2. A floor plan showing the existing features and a floor plan showing the proposed new features,
            3. Elevations and sections of both the proposed new features and the existing features,

Within fourteen (14) days of receiving the additional information, the staff shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the staff does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this section that the application is incomplete. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested.
    4. The determination of completeness does not preclude the staff or the Board from requiring additional information during the review process if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the criteria in this chapter and in any rules adopted by the Board, or if the proposed work changes. For example, additional information that may be required could include a shadow study or a traffic study when new construction is proposed.
2. An applicant may make a written request to submit an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design of a project, if the applicant waives in writing the deadline for a Board decision on the subsequent design phase or phases of the project and the applicant agrees in writing that the Board decision on the preliminary design is immediately appealable by the applicant or any interested person of record. The staff may reject the request if it appears that approval of a preliminary design would not be an efficient use of staff or Board time and resources, or would not further the goals and objectives of this chapter. To be complete, an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design must include the information listed above in subsection A2, subparagraphs a through h, i(1) through i(3), j, m and n. A certificate of approval that is granted for a preliminary design shall be conditioned upon subsequent submittal of the final design and all of the information listed above in subsection A2, and upon Board approval, prior to issuance of permits for work affecting any building or property in the District.
3. If an application is made to the Director for a permit for which a certificate of approval is required, the Director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall require the applicant to submit an application to the Board for a certificate of approval. Submission of a complete application for a certificate of approval to the Board shall be required before the permit application to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections may be determined to be complete.

### 25.24.040 - Criteria.

1. In carrying out its function, the Commission shall consider the purposes of this chapter as outlined in the chapter and the nature, function, and history of the District as described in this section.
2. The Historical District has played and continues to play a significant role in the development of Seattle and the Puget Sound Region since the inception of the Public Market in 1907. It has served as the center of local farm marketing, and other marketing businesses through varied economic times. It is significant in the culture of the region drawing together a broad spectrum of people from all ethnic, national, economic, and social backgrounds as a prototype of truly cosmopolitan urban life. It promotes local farming while making available local produce to shoppers and others. The District provides considerable housing for a community of low-income residents who are part of the life and color of the market. It has achieved world-wide fame as an uniquely American market and serves as the source of inspiration for markets elsewhere.
3. The Historical District is associated with the lives of many Seattle and Puget Sound region families and persons as farmers, merchants, and shoppers through marketing activities. It is an outstanding example of small independent businesses operating in the best tradition of American enterprise.
4. The buildings with their marketing activities and residential uses combine to form a distinctive area focusing on the central Market buildings which although humble and anonymous in character are an example of intriguing, dramatic architectural space servicing and adjusting to the varied and varying characteristic marketing activities. The central building spaces are particularly unique in form and character having grown to their present form through years of anonymous and functional creation to conform to the changing market activities always serving low-income customers along with other special needs of the public. The District possesses integrity of location, original construction, use, and of feeling and association.
5. The preservation of the Historical District will yield information of educational significance regarding our culture and our ecology as well as retaining its color, attraction, and interest for the City. Preservation of the District will retain a characteristic environment of a period of Seattle's history while continuing a vital cultural and economic aspect of the City.

To be complete, an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design must include the information listed above in subsection B2, subparagraphs a through j, k(i), k(ii), k(iii), k(v), l, o and p.

4. The Commission shall review and make recommendations regarding appropriateness of each proposed change or addition and a certificate of approval shall be issued by the Commission as provided in this chapter. The Commission, in considering the appropriateness of any alteration, demolition, new construction, reconstruction, restoration, remodeling, or other modification of any building or other structure in the Historic District, including structures to be located in public places, shall refer to the purpose of this chapter and shall consider among other things the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, the general design, arrangement, texture, material, occupancy and use, and color of the building or structure in question or its appurtenant fixtures, including signs, the relationship of such features to similar features of the other buildings within the Historical District and the position of such building or structure in relation to the street, public way, or semipublic way and to other buildings and structures. The Commission shall also make no recommendations or requirements except for the purpose of preventing developments inconsistent with the criteria of this chapter. Where modification of the appearance of a structure within the Historical District does not require a building or demolition permit, an application for a certificate of approval shall nonetheless be filed with the Commission.
5. The Commission shall have sole responsibility for determining the appropriate location, design and use of signs and structures to be located on or above the surface of public places in the Historical District and the sole responsibility for licensing and determining the appropriate locations for performers as defined in Section 17.32.010 H of the Seattle Municipal Code, in the Historical District; provided, that property owned by the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority shall not be considered a public place for the purposes of this subsection. The Commission shall establish guidelines for the use of public places in the District by performers, may assess reasonable permit fees, and may utilize the services of the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA) or should the PDA decline to make its services available, may utilize the services of any other organization appropriate for implementation of performers licensing guidelines. It shall be unlawful for any performer to actively solicit donations by word of mouth, gestures, mechanical devices, second parties.

2. A certificate of approval for a use shall be valid as long as the use is authorized by the applicable codes. Any other type of certificate of approval shall be valid for 18 months from the date of issuance of the decision granting it unless the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods grants an extension in writing; provided however, that certificates of approval for actions subject to permits issued by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections shall be valid for the life of the permit issued by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, including any extensions granted by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections in writing.

Map A forSand Point Naval Air Station Landmark District Map


### 25.30.040 - Criteria for district designation

1. District overview. Sand Point Naval Air Station Landmark District is located in northeast Seattle on the Sand Point peninsula within Warren G. Magnuson Park. The 90.91 acre landmark district encompasses three discontiguous parts of the original Naval Air Station Seattle site and contains concentrations of intact historic resources directly associated with the Naval Air Station operations between 1926 and 1953. The district is characterized by strong institutional cohesion of substantial buildings and structures linked organizationally through an intact historic road system. The streetscapes and landscape features contribute significantly to the unity of the setting and character of the landmark district. During the period of Navy use from the post-World War II era to 1991, many outlying parcels were decommissioned and converted to local uses. Also during this period many structures were demolished, including peripheral and smaller buildings. However, the landmark district retains and exhibits a high level of physical integrity. Intact buildings, structures, and objects continue to convey the quality and purpose of design, material, scale, and workmanship. The distinct functional building types reflect the pre-, during, and post-World War II operations of the Naval Air Station and its administrative role in the operation of other naval aviation facilities within the Thirteenth Naval District. The boundaries of the main core of the district generally follow existing and former roadways. The district encompasses a total of 53 contributing and non-contributing historic resources.
2. Architectural characteristics. The landmark district includes notable examples of Art Deco, Art Moderne, and Colonial Revival buildings as well as utilitarian buildings and structures that typify industrial vernacular and military architecture. The district also retains an important collection of Public Works Administration and Works Progress Administration funded projects that date from the pre-World War II era of station expansion. The buildings and structures within the landmark district remain generally intact and exhibit moderate to high levels of physical integrity. The organizational relationships among buildings remain evident, with maintenance and operational facilities situated to the north; residences and recreation facilities to the south; offices, training, and administration facilities centrally located to transition between these; and munitions and other aviation related facilities situated a distance away to the east, in close proximity to the operation of aircraft to be serviced. Primary building and structure types include aircraft hangars, office and administration buildings, a steam plant, officer housing and barracks, munitions magazines and storehouses, and aircraft maintenance shops. The use of brick, concrete, and steel as structural materials, as well as cladding elements, is a dominant design feature throughout the district. The scale and massing of facilities, in particular the hangars, reflect the magnitude of the aircraft that constituted the primary operational mission of the air station, as described in Appendix B of the Landmark Nomination Application.
3. Landscape features

    1. The landscape is a contributing design feature of the landmark district. The scale of streetscapes and placement and selection of trees and shrubs, coupled with the use of lawns and open space reinforce the district's formal setting and noble purpose of national defense as the nation braced for World War II. Only a small amount of the pre-naval historic landscape of Sand Point peninsula remains today. For example, Mud Lake, a 20-acre lake/bog that was located east of the former Married Officer's Quarters, was infilled. Similarly, the Pontiac Bay area to the north had rolling, forested wetlands fed by a small stream flowing into Lake Washington prior to settlement and conversion to farmlands.
    2. As the Naval Station was developed, the forest, wetlands, and knolls were leveled to create open, relatively level expanses of aircraft runways and naval facilities. The original street trees were planted within the Naval Station in the late 1930s and many of these remain along Sand Point Way NE and 62nd Avenue NE. These trees are a prominent feature of the southern half of the district. Other original ornamental trees also remain scattered throughout the district setting.
    3. Three trees within the district are of particular importance to the history of the site and have been formally identified as historic landscape features to be preserved and maintained:

        1. A white spruce is located off the southeast corner of Building 25. It was reportedly planted in 1931 by the Alaskan Yukon Pioneers' Society as a commemorative planting.
        2. A large Atlas Cedar (), commonly referred to as the Freedom Tree or Memorial Tree is located near the southeast corner of Building 25. When the Freedom Tree was approximately forty years old, it was re-dedicated as part of the Vietnam Memorial erected in 1972.
        3. A large Atlas Cedar is located at the southern end of 62nd Avenue NE, to the southeast of Building 26 South. This tree serves as a counterpoint to the flagpole located at the north end of 62nd Avenue NE, directly in front of Building 25. It was designated as the "holiday tree" when the base was operational.
    4. In addition to the trees identified in subsection 25.30.040.C.3, lawn areas and open space are important features within the vicinity of the historic office, recreation, and residential buildings. Other landscape features that evoke the character of the original planting designs include the planting areas that accent the main entry approach at NE 74th Street from Sand Point Way NE, and the residual remnants from a brick-lined rose garden indicated on historic plans, that are located to the south of Building 26 South.

### 25.30.050 - Design review guidelines

1. The Landmarks Preservation Board shall draft and, after consideration and review in accordance with Chapter 3.02, shall adopt design review guidelines as rules, which shall become effective upon filing with the City Clerk. Notice and conduct of such public hearing(s) shall be in accordance with the rules of the Landmarks Preservation Board and Chapter 3.02.
2. The design review guidelines shall identify the unique values of the District, include a statement of purpose and intent, and remain consistent with the purposes of this Chapter 25.30. The guidelines shall identify design characteristics that have either a positive or negative effect upon the unique values of the District. The guidelines shall also specify design-related considerations that will be allowed, encouraged, limited or excluded from the District when certificate of approval applications are reviewed.
3. The design review guidelines are intended to fulfill the preservation goals as established by the Sand Point Historic Properties Reuse and Protection Plan (Resolution 29725) and adhere to The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Properties (and associated National Park Service guidelines & technical briefs).
4. Until guidelines pursuant to subsection 25.30.050.A are adopted, the Landmarks Preservation Board shall review any application for a certificate of approval using the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Properties.

### 25.30.060 - District administration

1. Jurisdiction over changes and improvements to the District is vested in the Board. However in order to maintain adequate community outreach and engagement, an Application Review Committee is created, which shall consist of five members: two current or former members of the Board, at least one of whom shall be an architect; two members selected from District property owners, residents, or tenants; and one community member that has a demonstrated interest in the history and preservation of the Sand Point Naval Air Station Landmark District.
2. The members of the Application Review Committee shall be appointed to two year terms by the Chair of the Board, except that the first time the committee is formed the initial term of two members shall be one year. The committee shall review and make recommendations to the Board for issuance or denial of applications for certificates of approval within the District.
3. The Board shall establish an annual schedule of meetings for the Application Review Committee. The Board may amend that schedule as appropriate.

### 25.30.065 - Relationship between Board review and responsibilities of other City departments

The function of the Board under Section 25.30.060 is to review public or private applications for certificates of approval to demolish, alter or construct buildings, structures and site elements located within the District, for consistency with the landmarks criteria prescribed in Section 25.30.090. It is not the function of the Board to regulate the use of property within the District, which is the responsibility of the Department of Planning and Development, or to manage the use of City owned property within the District, which is the responsibility of the Department of Parks and Recreation if the properties are within the boundaries of Warren G.

Within 14 days of receiving the additional information, the Department staff shall notify the applicant in writing whether the application is now complete or what additional information is necessary. An application shall be deemed to be complete if the Department staff does not notify the applicant in writing by the deadlines in this Section 25.30.080 that the application is incomplete. A determination that the application is complete is not a determination that the application is vested.
    4. The determination of completeness does not preclude the Department staff or the Board from requiring additional information during the review process, if more information is needed to evaluate the application according to the criteria in this chapter and in any rules adopted by the Board, or if the proposed work changes. For example, additional information that may be required could include a shadow study or a traffic study when new construction is proposed.
2. An applicant may make a written request to submit an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design of a project if the applicant waives in writing the deadline for a Board decision on the subsequent design phase or phases of the project and the applicant agrees in writing that the Board decision on the preliminary design is immediately appealable by the applicant or any interested person of record. The Department staff may reject the request if it appears that approval of a preliminary design would not be an efficient use of Department staff or Board time and resources or would not further the goals and objectives of this chapter. To be complete, an application for a certificate of approval for a preliminary design must include the information listed above in subsection 25.30.080.A.2, except subsections 25.30.080.A.2.i.4, A.2.i.5, A.2.k, and A.2.l. A certificate of approval that is granted for a preliminary design shall be conditioned upon subsequent submittal of the final design and all of the information listed above in subsection 25.30.080.A.2, and upon Board approval, prior to issuance of permits for work affecting any building or property in the District or to commencing work that does not require permits.
3. If an application is made to the Director for a permit for which a certificate of approval is required, the Director shall require the applicant to submit an application to the Board for a certificate of approval. Submission of a complete application for a certificate of approval to the Board shall be required before the permit application to the Department of Planning and Development may be determined to be complete. The Director shall continue to process the application but shall not issue any permit until a certificate of approval has been issued pursuant to this chapter, or the time for filing the notice of denial of a certificate of approval with the Director has expired.
4. After the Board has commenced proceedings for the consideration of any application for a certificate of approval for a particular alteration or significant change by giving notice of a meeting pursuant to this Section 25.30.080 or otherwise, no other application for the same or a similar alteration or significant change at the same site may be made until the application is withdrawn or such proceedings and all appeals of the decision on the application have been concluded, except that an application may be made for a certificate of approval for the preliminary design of a project and a later application may be made for a certificate of approval for subsequent design phase or phases of the same project.
5. A certificate of approval shall be valid for 18 months from the date of issuance of the Board's decision granting it, unless the Board grants an extension in writing; provided however, that certificates of approval for actions subject to permits issued by the Department of Planning and Development shall be valid for the life of the permit, including any extensions granted in writing by the Department of Planning and Development.

### 25.30.090 - Board meeting on certificate of approval

1. Within 30 days after the Department determines an application for a certificate of approval is complete, the Board shall hold a meeting on the application and shall serve notice of the meeting on the owner and the applicant not fewer than five days before the date of the meeting.
2. In reviewing applications or appeals of decisions of the Board, the Board and the Hearing Examiner shall consider:

    1. The purposes of this chapter;
    2. The criteria specified in Section 25.30.040;
    3. Guidelines promulgated pursuant to this Chapter 25.30;
    4. The properties' historical and architectural or landscape value and significance;
    5. The properties' architectural or landscape type and general design;
    6. The arrangement, texture, material, and color of the building or structure in question, and its appurtenant fixtures, including signs;
    7. The relationship of such features to similar features within the Sand Point Naval Air Station Landmark District; and
    8. The position of such buildings, structures, or landscape elements in relation to public property and to other buildings, structures, and landscape elements.

### 25.30.100 - Issuance of Board decision

The Board shall consider the recommendation of the Application Review Committee and shall, within 45 days after the application for a certificate of approval is determined to be complete, issue a written decision either granting, granting with conditions, or denying a certificate of approval, and shall mail a copy of the decision to the owner, the applicant, and the Director within three working days after such decision. A decision denying a certificate of approval shall contain an explanation of the reasons for the Board's decision and specific findings with respect to this Chapter 25.30 and the adopted guidelines for the District. Notice of the Board's decision shall be provided to any person who, prior to the rendering of the decision, made a written request to receive notice of the decision or submitted written substantive comments on the application.


### 25.30.110 - Appeal to Hearing Examiner

The time period to consider and decide the appeal of a certificate of approval shall be exempt from the deadlines for review and decision on both the certificate of approval and any related permit applications.


1. Any interested person of record may appeal to the Hearing Examiner the decision of the Board to grant, grant with conditions, or deny a certificate of approval by serving written notice of appeal upon the Board and by filing such notice and a copy of the Board's decision with the Hearing Examiner within 14 days after the date the Board's decision is issued.
2. If the proposed action that is the subject of the certificate of approval is also the subject of one or more related permit applications under review by the Department of Planning and Development, then the appellant must also file notice of the appeal with the Department of Planning and Development, and the appeal of the certificate of approval shall not be heard until all of the time periods for filing administrative appeals on the other permits have expired, except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for the preliminary design or for subsequent design phases may proceed immediately according to Section 25.30.080 without being consolidated. If one or more appeals are filed regarding the other permits, then the appeal of the certificate of approval shall be consolidated with them and shall be heard according to the same timelines established for the other appeals, except that appeals to the State Shoreline Hearings Board shall proceed independently according to the timelines set by the state for such appeals, and except that an appeal of a certificate of approval for a preliminary design or for a subsequent design phase may proceed according to Section 25.30.080 without being consolidated. If the related permit decisions would not be appealable, then the appeal of the certificate of approval decision shall proceed immediately after it is filed.
3. The applicant for the certificate of approval may elect to have the appeal proceed immediately rather than postponed for consolidation with appeals of related permit applications, if the applicant agrees in writing that the Department of Planning and Development may suspend its review of the related permits, and that the time period for review of those permits shall be suspended until the Hearing Examiner issues a decision on the appeal of the certificate of approval.
4. The Hearing Examiner shall hear and determine the appeal in accordance with the standards and procedures established for appeals to the Hearing Examiner under Sections 25.12.740, 25.12.750, and 25.12.760 of the Landmarks Preservation Ordinance, and as prescribed under subsection 25.30.090.B.
5. The Hearing Examiner shall issue a decision not later than 90 days after the last of the appeals of related permit decisions is filed, or, if the applicant chooses to proceed immediately with the appeal of the certificate of approval, as provided in subsection 25.30.110.C, then not later than 90 days from the filing of that appeal.

### 25.30.120 - Requests for interpretation

1. An applicant for a certificate of approval may request an interpretation of the meaning of any part of this Chapter 25.30 as it relates to the requested certificate of approval. An interpretation shall not have any effect on certificates of approval that have already been granted.
2. An interpretation must be in writing, specify the section of the code to be interpreted, and specify the question to be addressed. Requests shall be submitted to the Historic Preservation Officer.
3. If the requested interpretation relates to a certificate of approval for which an application has been filed, then the request for an interpretation cannot be made any later than 14 days after the application for the certificate of approval was submitted, provided however, that a request for an interpretation may be sought by the applicant at a later time, if the applicant agrees in writing to suspend the time frames for review of the certificate of approval and the time frames applicable to any related permits that are under review until the interpretation is issued.
4. Interpretations shall be made in writing by the Historic Preservation Officer, and shall be issued within 25 days of submission of the request. The interpretation decision shall be served on the requesting party, and notice of the decision shall be mailed to parties of record and interested persons of record.
5. A fee shall be charged for interpretations in the amount provided in Chapter 22.900C, Fees for Land Use Review, and shall be collected by the Department of Neighborhoods.
6. An interpretation may be appealed by the applicant if the certificate of approval that the interpretation addresses is denied and the applicant is appealing the denial, or if the interpretation relates to conditions placed on the certificate of approval that the applicant is appealing. An appeal of an interpretation must be filed at the same time as the appeal of the related certificate of approval, and shall be consolidated with the appeal of the related certificate of approval. Appeal of the interpretation shall proceed according to the same procedures and time frames provided in Section 25.30.110 for appeal of a certificate of approval, including the provisions for consolidation with appeals of any related permit decisions.
7. The Hearing Examiner shall give substantial weight to the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation. The appellant shall have the burden of establishing that the interpretation is erroneous.
8. The Hearing Examiner may affirm, reverse, or modify the Historic Preservation Officer's interpretation, in whole or in part. The Hearing Examiner may also remand the interpretation to the Historic Preservation Officer for further consideration.
9. The decision of the Hearing Examiner is final. The Hearing Examiner's decision is binding upon the Historic Preservation Officer and the Board, as well as all parties of record to the proceeding. Copies of the Hearing Examiner's decision shall be mailed to the Historic Preservation Officer and to all parties of record before the Hearing Examiner. Judicial review must be commenced within 21 days of issuance of the Hearing Examiner's decision, as provided by RCW 36.70C.040.
